It was the ransacking of the Magnificent Mile which is, as Allahpundit noted, Chicago\u2019s answer to 5th Avenue in New York or Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. There was no pretense of anyone calling for justice for George Floyd or racial tolerance or whatever the latest watchword of the day might be. People were literally showing up with U-Haul trucks and emptying out all of the high-end, luxury goods stores.\n\nSo how did the Mayor respond? She described it as \u201cstraight-up, felony criminal conduct\u201d and \u201can assault on our city.\u201d Okay then. Now that we\u2019ve established that you have a crime wave going on and not some sort of First Amendment issue, what do you plan to do about it? It looks like the Mayor huddled with the Chicago PD and they\u2019ve decided to launch an investigation. What a brilliant plan. I wonder why nobody thought of that before? (CBS Chicago)\n\nOne day after another round of violent looting tore through downtown Chicago and the Magnificent Mile, Chicago Police announced the creation of a new task force to help hold looters responsible. The Bureau of Detectives is seeking help from businesses and community leaders in gathering that information. As CBS 2 Investigator Megan Hickey reported, the task force is hoping to use the pictures and videos to track the looters down.\n\nCollecting all of the surveillance videos and attempting to identify the looters seems like something that the police should have been doing back in, I don\u2019t know\u2026 April? Instead, this new strategy is looking like a marked departure from the previous Lightfoot and Chicago PD philosophy of mimicking the street poet\u2019s in Springsteen\u2019s Jungleland and just standing back to let it all be.\n\nCBS Chicago spoke to one shop owner from the less glamorous end of the Magnificent Mile who was both shocked and frustrated to find that the Mayor had suddenly been spurred to action after it was far too late for her more modest business. Maleeha Zahid had just opened up her consignment shop \u201cThe Find\u201d in November. Zahid and her twin brother had previously marched with Black Lives Matter activists and worked to promote racial justice as minority store owners. That didn\u2019t slow the mob down. The shop\u2019s windows were smashed and $35,000 worth of inventory was taken. She\u2019s not sure if she will be able to afford to reopen. And even if she does, she\u2019s worried that it will just happen again on Black Friday or on Christmas.\n\nMeanwhile, in a sign that the \u201cpeaceful protesters\u201d really know no boundaries, here\u2019s an even more depressing side note. On Monday, they took time out to smash in the windows and doors at the Ronald McDonald house near one of the city\u2019s hospitals. For those not familiar with this service, they provide free housing for families who have severely ill children in the hospital for extended periods, frequently including those children undergoing cancer treatment. (Free Beacon)\n\nLooters targeted a Ronald McDonald House\u2014a charity that provides free housing to families with sick children\u2014in downtown Chicago Monday morning. Thousands drove into Chicago early Monday to loot high-end retailers, department stores, and other businesses around the city\u2019s Magnificent Mile. Residents and staff in the nearby Ronald McDonald House were forced into lockdown as looters targeted the building, breaking the charity\u2019s doors and windows.\n\nJust lovely. But now the Mayor is finally going to unleash the awesome investigatory powers of the Chicago PD to examine some videos and see if any of the thieves can be identified and arrested. Normally we might say \u201cbetter late than never,\u201d but in this case, it might already be too late. Control of the city has been surrendered to the mob and they no longer fear retribution from the police. The thin veneer of civilization has been torn and you\u2019re getting a peek at what dwells on the other side.", "METADATA": {"keywords": "accountability, Chicago, Illinois, looting, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, riots", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/themes/hotair-desktop/images/ha_favicon/smalltile.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/themes/hotair-desktop/images/ha_favicon/mediumtile.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/themes/hotair-desktop/images/ha_favicon/widetile.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/themes/hotair-desktop/images/ha_favicon/largetile.png", "thm": {"title": "Chicago: You know, someone should hold these looters accountable\u2026"}, "description": "Ya think?", "robots": "noodp", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Chicago: You know, someone should hold these looters accountable...", "description": "Ya think?", "url": "https://hotair.com/archives/jazz-shaw/2020/08/13/chicago-know-someone-hold-looters-accountable/", "site_name": "HotAir", "updated_time": "2020-08-13T06:22:54-04:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chicago-violence-2.jpg", "width": 715, "height": 378}, "referenced": "https://hotair.com/archives/jazz-shaw/2020/08/13/chicago-know-someone-hold-looters-accountable/"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/hotaircom", "tag": "riots", "section": "The Blog", "published_time": "2020-08-13T08:01:25-04:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T06:22:54-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 312482775445602, "pages": "41632789656,103971336305218,319569361390023,106547192707583,124538510989702,283971595408,15418366158,153162531376557,127519040661256,123834811060739,305174559545115,321502821264274,413465452078762,492802317512753,140705212665688,116757565026850,114013445328868"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Ya think?", "title": "Chicago: You know, someone should hold these looters accountable...", "site": "@hotairblog", "image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chicago-violence-2.jpg", "creator": "@hotairblog"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
