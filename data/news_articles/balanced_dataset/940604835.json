I know our military has talked to their senior leaders as well. We won\u2019t brook that; we won\u2019t tolerate that.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from Trump\u2019s allegation that the story wasn\u2019t even real.\n\n\u201cThe Russia Bounty story is just another made up by Fake News tale that is told only to damage me and the Republican Party,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe Russia Bounty story is just another made up by Fake News tale that is told only to damage me and the Republican Party. The secret source probably does not even exist, just like the story itself. If the discredited @nytimes has a source, reveal it. Just another HOAX! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 1, 2020\n\nWhen questioned about it again, he again said that he thought it was fake.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAs far as the bounty is concerned: I think it\u2019s a hoax,\u201d the president told Gray Television last month. \u201cI think it\u2019s a Democrat hoax, because good people in intelligence said that they did not think it rose to the level of bringing it to the president. Nobody brought it to me. But they said, \u2018It didn\u2019t rise to that level.\u2019\u201d\n\nPompeo has been cagey about the specifics from the intelligence community.\n\n\u201cI want to be very careful about what\u2019s public record and what\u2019s intelligence-based,\u201d he said. \u201cBut yes, I can assure you and the American people that each time I\u2019ve spoken with Foreign Minister Lavrov, I\u2019ve raised all of the issues that put any American interests at risk.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Post developed a timeline that outlines Trump\u2019s insistence that the story wasn\u2019t legitimate. It\u2019s a frequent problem in the White House where the president has one message and his administration will say something else. It\u2019s remarkably similar to the way that Trump treated the Russian attack on the U.S. election in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the two versions are almost impossible to square,\u201d said the Post report. \u201cIf this is serious enough for Pompeo to issue a stern warning to Lavrov, it would seem serious enough to bring it to Trump\u2019s attention and for Trump to raise the issue with Putin. If the nation\u2019s top diplomat is putting Russia on notice about something \u2014 however substantiated it is by the intelligence \u2014 how can it also be a \u2018hoax\u2019 or \u2018fake news?'\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe frank answer is that it can\u2019t. It was revealed in June that intelligence and White House advisers don\u2019t even tell Trump negative things that Russia has done because he won\u2019t believe it and even if he does, he won\u2019t care anyway.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a thoroughly unreassuring way to run a country, particularly when it comes to something that could \u2014 and intelligence has indicated already has \u2014 cost the lives of American troops,\u201d the piece closed.\n\nRead the full report at the Washington Post.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mike-Pompeo-and-Vladimir-Putin.jpg", "url": "https://www.rawstory.com/2020/08/pompeo-threatens-russia-with-enormous-price-to-pay-for-bounties-while-trump-still-denies-them/", "title": "Pompeo threatens Russia with \u2018enormous price to pay\u2019 for bounties while Trump still denies them", "description": "President Donald Trump still denies that Russia issued bounties on the heads of American soldiers in Afghanistan, but his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, didn\u2019t get the memo.
