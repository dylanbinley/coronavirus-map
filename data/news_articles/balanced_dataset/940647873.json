It will be continuous work going into tomorrow to see if the problem has disappeared.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a question mark. And I don\u2019t know the answer yet, because we need to switch the engine on, go on track, and see if the problem is solved. But I\u2019m hopeful after changing so much stuff that this is going to go away, and I can have a normal weekend.\u201d\n\nGet your hands on the official McLaren 2020 collection via the Formula 1 store\n\nBut as for how he expects his weekend to go, Sainz told everyone to come back to him on Friday evening after practice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very good question that I\u2019ll be very happy to answer tomorrow evening when we have some laps in Barcelona,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe probably have a track temperature of 30 degrees hotter than what we did here in winter testing. It\u2019s impossible to know.\n\n\u201cWhat I know for a fact is that [last weekend] it was warmer and we struggled a bit more with the management of the tyres and the handling of the car, so it\u2019s pretty warm here, so not over expecting too much.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time we are an F1 team, we have had three or four days to analyse what went wrong, and hopefully we can get things a bit more together this week.\n\n\u201cThe car in winter testing felt pretty good. I feel the last sector is a bit of a weakness for this car, so we need to keep an eye on it and see how we can keep improving in these areas.\u201d\n\nSainz\u2019s team-mate Lando Norris said McLaren would also be working to make sure the cooling problems didn\u2019t affect him, even though there was no sign of them for the Briton during the 70th Anniversary GP.\n\n\u201cAt the time it was more of a problem on Carlos\u2019s car, which like he mentioned was something that was a bit unknown, the exact reason for it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve made the changes of what they think might be affecting it for this weekend, and something that will be looked over very closely, as it\u2019s quite a high priority thing.\n\n\u201cAnd it cost performance, like Carlos said, so it\u2019s something that they will be looking at on my car, because obviously they don\u2019t want it to happen. But in Silverstone it was OK on my car.\u201d\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Planet_F1 and like our Facebook page.", "METADATA": {"google-site-verification": "a6HhpRvqqfvmuXuf7355vSlR7eX2O5vEa9z9ecyZtRM", "description": "Carlos Sainz says there is still a \"question mark\" surrounding cooling issues which plagued the Spaniard at the 70th Anniversary GP.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Carlos Sainz: McLaren cooling issues remain a 'question mark' | PlanetF1", "description": "Carlos Sainz says there is still a \"question mark\" surrounding cooling issues which plagued the Spaniard at the 70th Anniversary GP.", "url": "https://www.planetf1.com/news/carlos-sainz-mclaren-cooling-issues/", "site_name": "PlanetF1", "image": {"identifier": "https://d3cm515ijfiu6w.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/09210216/PA.54886361.jpg", "secure_url": "https://d3cm515ijfiu6w.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/09210216/PA.54886361.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "alt": "Carlos Sainz PA"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/planetf1com/", "tag": "McLaren", "section": "News"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.9", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "PlanetF1", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 647827705229228, "admins": "530019146,539231474,1166123822"}, "verification": "c07ffa1268f116f58a58fb206caed1e7", "webgains-site-verification": "nxwfdfxt", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.planetf1.com/content/themes/planet/img/icons/mstile-144x144.png"}}}
