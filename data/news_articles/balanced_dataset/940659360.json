Kondrashova joins IPG-owned Huge from Uber, where she was the London-based director of brand strategy for the U.K. and Ireland.\n\nAt Huge, she will report to Mark Manning, the West Coast president at Huge, while calling the agency\u2019s headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, home. Kondrashova will lead the global strategy discipline for Huge\u2019s long-standing client, Google, directing a team of strategists to support a range of Google products and services.\n\nIn the last six months, Huge has named new global chiefs of strategy and design.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled to join the incredibly talented team at Huge and to partner so closely with Google on such an exciting mix of strategic initiatives,\u201d Kondrashova said in a statement. \u201c[It\u2019s] one of the most innovative companies in the world, and I can\u2019t wait to get started.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt Uber, Kondrashova focused on brand reputation, market share and go-to-market plans for new products and services. She exits the company during a tough period, marked by pandemic slowdowns and litigation issues surrounding safety and the categorization of driver\u2019s employment status.\n\n\n\nHer background is rooted in advertising agencies, including stints as strategy director at the London offices of R/GA and McCann Worldgroup. At R/GA, Kondrashova worked on the McDonald\u2019s business, while at McCann, she was part of the planning teams for Coca-Cola, L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris, Pandora and Mastercard, among others.\n\n\n\n\u201cIrina is an incredible strategic thinker and brings a wealth of experience that will be valuable for our Google clients,\u201d said Manning, in a statement. \u201cDuring a time of massive change for agencies and clients, we\u2019re delighted to have someone of Irina\u2019s unique ability joining Huge and I couldn\u2019t be more excited about the new dimension she\u2019ll bring to the work we do with Google.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn recent months, Huge has navigated changes of its own. In July, it brought on Judith Hoogenboom, a consultant at SYPartners, to be its new global chief strategy officer, and in late 2019, Fura Johannesdottir left Publicis Sapient EMEA to join Huge as its global chief design officer.", "METADATA": {"description": "Irina Kondrashova, formerly London-based director of brand strategy for Uber, will focus on the agency\u2019s Google business.", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0 shrink-to-fit=no", "msapplication-TileColor": "#c5001d", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "campaignlive.com", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@campaignmag", "url": "https://www.campaignlive.com/article/1691649", "description": "Irina Kondrashova, formerly London-based director of brand strategy for Uber, will focus on the agency\u2019s Google business.", "title": "More big moves at Huge as agency names new VP of strategy", "image": "https://cached.imagescaler.hbpl.co.uk/resize/scaleWidth/815/cached.offlinehbpl.hbpl.co.uk/news/SUC/irina.jpg"}, "og": {"title": "More big moves at Huge as agency names new VP of strategy", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/big-moves-huge-agency-names-new-vp-strategy/1691649?utm_source=website&utm_medium=social", "image": "https://cached.imagescaler.hbpl.co.uk/resize/scaleHeight/815/cached.offlinehbpl.hbpl.co.uk/news/SUC/irina.jpg"}}}}
