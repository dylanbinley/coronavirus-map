Sylvia Christensen\n\nEAU CLAIRE, Wis. \u2014 About 200 soldiers from the Wisconsin Army National Guard\u2019s 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry returned home Friday after a year-long mobilization to Afghanistan.\n\nA traditional homecoming ceremony was not possible due to coronavirus restrictions, so a group of senior leaders from the Wisconsin National Guard greeted the soldiers when their plane landed in Eau Claire.\n\n\u201cYou have done a phenomenal job,\u201d Lt. Col. Aaron Freund, commander of the 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry Regiment said. \u201cYou have all become American heroes and are part of something special. As your commander, I thank you for the privilege of watching you perform.\u201d\n\nAfter getting off the plane, the troops boarded buses that took them to armories in Menomonie, Arcadia, River Falls and Eau Claire where their families waited for them to return.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2020 BY CHANNEL 3000.
