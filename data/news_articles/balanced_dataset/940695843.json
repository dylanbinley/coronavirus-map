Construction was scheduled to start in June 2011 with the strata plans to be registered in December 2013.\n\nIn late 2013, it emerged the building\u2019s strata plan had not been registered. Buyers cancelled their contracts and asked for their money back but were refused.\n\nNSW Fair Trading subsequently investigated Empire\u2019s bank records, which revealed that soon after each deposit was received the money was moved elsewhere instead of being held in trust.\n\nValerie Griswold, Fair Trading NSW Executive Director of Investigation and Enforcement said the case sends a strong message to real estate agents.\n\n\u201cMost real estate agents are doing the right thing, but we have to make sure any that aren\u2019t are investigated and dealt with appropriately,\u201d Ms Griswold said.\n\n\u201cThis case should act as a deterrent to all real estate agents. There can be no tolerance for misusing funds or other fraudulent behaviour.\u201d\n\nMr Tran pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud under the Property, Stock & Business Agents Act in Parramatta Local Court and was sentenced to a 20 months Intensive Correction Order along with 300 hours of community service.\n\nMr Tran has a right of appeal in respect of the court\u2019s sentence.\n\nIn 2017, Fair Trading disqualified Mr Tran from being involved in the management or conduct of a real estate agent business for a period of six years.\n\n/Public Release.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": 756916821089723}, "news_keywords": "agreement, building, business, community, community service, court, fair trading nsw, investigation, money, nsw, nsw fair trading, parramatta, project, property, real estate, sydney", "description": "A former Sydney real estate agent has been sentenced to a 20-month intensive correct order after mishandling $187,500 from his clients.
