He said the state of emergency's only justification is to extend the power of the state and security agencies and \u201ccontrol the opposition.\"\n\n\u201cWe were waiting for the army to help in reconstruction, not be an extension of power,\u201d Saghieh said.\n\nLebanese government officials have largely avoided the scene of destruction and have not been seen in the streets passing out aid, Fox News' Trey Yingst reported from Beirut.\n\nInstead, international agencies and organizations have flocked to the city to help. France, in particular, has led efforts, talking to political parties to hasten the formation of a new government and curb corruption in the city.\n\nThe French defense minister and U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale are both expected to push for sweeping reforms during visits to Lebanon Thursday.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The order gives the\u00a0army broad power to curb free speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of the press, as well as to enter homes and arrest anyone deemed a security threat under the guise of protecting a city in turmoil.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "world", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.creator": "Vandana Rambaran", "dc.title": "Lebanon activists fear military crackdown under state of emergency declaration", "dcterms.abstract": "The order gives the\u00a0army broad power to curb free speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of the press, as well as to enter homes and arrest anyone deemed a security threat under the guise of protecting a city in turmoil.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "The order gives the\u00a0army broad power to curb free speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of the press, as well as to enter homes and arrest anyone deemed a security threat under the guise of protecting a city in turmoil.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:a23dc2a5-ca93-50b7-abb1-fb260c1ae51e", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2020-08-13", "dcterms.created": "2020-08-13T07:04:14-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2020-08-13T11:24:55-04:00", "og": {"title": "Lebanon activists fear military crackdown under state of emergency declaration", "description": "The order gives the\u00a0army broad power to curb free speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of the press, as well as to enter homes and arrest anyone deemed a security threat under the guise of protecting a city in turmoil.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/08/AP20223626703896.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/lebanon-parliament-approves-state-of-emergency-after-beirut-blast-raising-concerns-about-police-crackdowns-on-protesters", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Lebanon activists fear military crackdown under state of emergency declaration", "description": "The order gives the\u00a0army broad power to curb free speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of the press, as well as to enter homes and arrest anyone deemed a security threat under the guise of protecting a city in turmoil.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/08/1024/512/AP20223626703896.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/lebanon-parliament-approves-state-of-emergency-after-beirut-blast-raising-concerns-about-police-crackdowns-on-protesters"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/WORLD/WORLD REGIONS/MIDDLE EAST/Lebanon,/FOX NEWS/WORLD,/FOX NEWS/WORLD/World Politics", "classification-isa": "lebanon,world,world-politics", "classification-tags": "lebanon,world-politics"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
