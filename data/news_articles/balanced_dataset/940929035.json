The tests were submitted to the National Investigation Agency earlier this week.\n\nBlood samples from Muhsin\u2019s mother Maimoona Abdulla, collected by the NIA, were matched with tissue collected from the suicide-bomber\u2019s remains by Afghan authorities, the sources said.\n\nAn NIA spokesperson said the agency had no comment to offer as the investigation was ongoing.\n\nBorn in 1991 in the small town of Trikarpur, near Kasargode, Muhsin is believed to have been part of a group of Indian terrorists in Afghanistan, led by one-time Kashmir jihad commander Aijaz Ahanger. Photographs released on Islamic State-linked social media channels had proclaimed Muhsin had carried out the Gurdwara attack, which claimed 27 lives.\n\nFollowing his school education, Muhsin left Kerala to work at a small hotel run by relatives in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. He later obtained a job in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, where he lived until 2018, before leaving for Afghanistan to join Ahanger\u2019s group. Few details, though, have so far emerged on what led him to join the group.\n\nNIA investigators registered a case against the Kabul Gurdwara attack in April, the first using a landmark new law giving the organisation jurisdiction to investigate crimes outside India.\n\nThe core of the Indian jihadist group in Afghanistan was formed by 26 Kerala residents \u2014 some of them children \u2014 who left for Afghanistan in 2016, led by neo-fundamentalist cult leader Abdul Rashid Abdullah.\n\nIjas Kallukettiya Purayil, a one-time dentist from Kerala\u2019s Kasargod who was among that group, is believed to be among the suicide attackers killed when his jihadist unit stormed a prison in Afghanistan\u2019s Jalalabad earlier this month. Twenty-nine people were reported to have been killed in the attack, aimed at freeing jihadists from the prison on Eid.\n\nPurayil\u2019s wife, Rafilla Purayil, and has been held in Kabul\u2019s Badam Bagh prison along with their five-year-old son, Ayaan, is currently part of a group of nine Indian women held in Kabul\u2019s Badam Bagh jail, the wives and widows of the Kerala jihadists.\n\nPurayil\u2019s younger brother, Shiyas Purayil, is thought to have been killed in a United States military drone strike in Nangarhar along with his wife Ajmala Purayil.\n\nThe jihadist brothers\u2019 cousin, Ashfaq Purayil, who once ran a hotel in Mumbai, is also thought to have survived the bomb strikes. Ashfaq Purayil\u2019s wife, Shamsiya Purayil, and their four-year-old daughter Ayesha are also among those held in Badam Bagh prison.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s intelligence service, the National Directorate for Security, arrested the group\u2019s military commander, Aijaz Ahanger, in raids conducted in Kandahar earlier this year. NDS sources have told News18 that while Ahanger\u2019s group claimed affiliation to the Islamic State, it was in fact controlled by the Haqqani Network \u2014 a constituent of the Taliban, with close links to Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate.\n\nThe jihad commander\u2019s Budgam-born wife, Rukhsana Dar, is among the Indian jihadists\u2019 wives held in Badam Bagh prison, along with her daughters Sabira and Tooba.", "METADATA": {"application-name": "DNA Tests Confirm Kabul Gurdwara Attacker was One-Time Kerala Resident Muhammad Muhsin", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "News", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Blood samples from Muhsin\u2019s mother, collected by the NIA, were matched with tissue collected from the suicide-bomber\u2019s remains by Afghan authorities, sources in the NIA said.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
