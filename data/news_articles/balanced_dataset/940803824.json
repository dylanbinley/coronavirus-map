Later, it (or PIF specifically) voluntarily withdrew from the process.\"\n\nMasters' comments came after the consortium withdrew its bid for the club having waited in vain for the green light, although Ashley has insisted he remains committed to the deal 17 weeks after the matter went to the Premier League.\n\n\u00a9 2020 AFP", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/a951d160-de44-11ea-856b-005056a98db9/w:1280/p:16x9/1d28f860cd48209c3df2b7f8ddd87ad57f64f29d.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "RFI", "type": "article", "title": "Premier League chief opens up on failed Newcastle takeover - RFI", "description": "Premier League chief opens up on failed Newcastle takeover", "url": "https://www.rfi.fr/en/wires/20200814-premier-league-chief-opens-failed-newcastle-takeover"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113191652055439, "pages": 28764872018}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RFI.English/", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/RFI.English/", "published_time": "2020-08-14T15:23:31+00:00"}, "description": "Premier League chief opens up on failed Newcastle takeover", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@RFI_En"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "RFI", "application-name": "RFI", "msapplication-TileColor": "#e2001a", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}}}
