His presence stood in stark contrast to the relative absence of Lebanese government officials since the incident.\n\nMacron toured the rubble and promised frustrated protesters that aid would not fall into corrupt hands.\n\nLebanon's prime minister, Hassan Diab, and his entire cabinet resigned earlier this week as reports surfaced that officials had been aware for years of the 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate stored in Beirut's port, which caught fire and triggered the deadly explosion.\n\nMacron is hoping to broker a deal between opposing political factions in Lebanon to rebuild the city and restore the government while also coordinating international aid for recovery efforts.\n\nOver the weekend, he chaired a virtual aid conference that garnered $295 million in pledges.\n\nMacron has also urged both Russia and Iran -- key power players in the region -- to coordinate aid efforts with the rest of the international community to restore stability.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nInstead, the two nations have offered bilateral aid rather than participating in efforts through the U.N.
