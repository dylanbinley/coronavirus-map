The new bench includes Chief Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Amir Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for September 3.\n\nLast week, the foreign ministry had said that Pakistan has not reached out to India regarding the Islamabad High Court\u2019s order for the appointment of a lawyer.\n\nIn July, India had accused Pakistan of blocking all legal remedies to Jadhav and accused the country of adopting a \u201cfarcical approach\u201d to the case. On July 17, Pakistan had claimed it had offered to grant India consular access to Jadhav for the third time without the presence of a security guard. India had got the second consular access to Jadhav on July 16, but the officials who had gone to meet him alleged that they were not provided \u201cunimpeded access\u201d and that he was visibly under stress due to the presence of Pakistani officials at the meeting.\n\nA Pakistani military court had sentenced Jadhav to death in April 2017 for allegedly spying for India. Jadhav\u2019s execution was stayed after India moved the International Court of Justice against the verdict in May 2017. India had contended in the court in The Hague that the lack of consular access to Jadhav was a violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.\n\nIn its July 2019 judgement, the International Court of Justice had concluded that Pakistan had violated the Vienna Convention in its treatment of Jadhav and ordered Islamabad not to execute him at the moment. Following the court\u2019s judgement, Pakistan allowed India access to the former naval officer.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover", "google-play-app": "app-id=in.scroll.android", "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "Scroll.in App for Android"}, "id": {"googleplay": "in.scroll.android"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"src": "https://s02.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/58472-tdoonmargg-1594207393.jpg"}, "description": "Anurag Srivastava, the official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, said Islamabad has not implemented the ICJ judgement.", "title": "Kulbhushan Jadhav case: India accuses Pakistan of failing to address core matters, provide access", "url": "https://scroll.in/latest/970389/kulbhushan-jadhav-case-india-accuses-pakistan-of-failing-to-address-core-matters-provide-access", "site": {"identifier": "@scroll_in", "id": "@scroll_in"}, "creator": "@scroll_in"}, "og": {"title": "Kulbhushan Jadhav case: India accuses Pakistan of failing to address core matters, provide access", "description": "Anurag Srivastava, the official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, said Islamabad has not implemented the ICJ judgement.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://s02.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/58472-tdoonmargg-1594207393.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 315}, "site_name": "Scroll.in", "url": "https://scroll.in/latest/970389/kulbhushan-jadhav-case-india-accuses-pakistan-of-failing-to-address-core-matters-provide-access"}, "description": "Anurag Srivastava, the official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, said Islamabad has not implemented the ICJ judgement.", "author": "Scroll Staff", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/scroll.in", "tag": "MEA"}, "keywords": "India, google news, trending news, top news, Kulbhushan Jadhav, Pakistan, MEA", "dcterms.title": "Kulbhushan Jadhav case: India accuses Pakistan of failing to address core matters, provide access", "dcterms.description": "Anurag Srivastava, the official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, said Islamabad has not implemented the ICJ judgement.", "dcterms.type": "Text", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.language": "en_US", "dcterms.identifier": "https://scroll.in/latest/970389/kulbhushan-jadhav-case-india-accuses-pakistan-of-failing-to-address-core-matters-provide-access", "dcterms.created": "2020-08-14T23:14:00+05:30", "dcterms.available": "2020-08-14T23:14:00+05:30", "dcterms.publisher": "https://scroll.in", "dcterms.creator": "Scroll Staff", "dcterms.subject": "India, google news, trending news, top news, Kulbhushan Jadhav, Pakistan, MEA", "atdlayout": "articlepage"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
