The teachers use Clear Touch interactive panels and cameras to interact with their students and offer live teaching.\n\n\"Teachers will have access to their own classroom, free from distractions and they're in an environment that is safe, and conducive, but it affords them the technologies that they simply do not have at home,\" said Micah Ali, the President of Compton Unified School District.\n\nOne of the middle school teachers from Davis Middle School, Jose Gonzalez, gave FOX 11 a demonstration of how the live instruction will work in the classroom.\n\n\"I can communicate with my kids and pull up different screens when I'm speaking with them, but the benefit as well is that I'm in the classroom and I can use any of the materials that I have,\" said Gonzalez.\n\nGonzalez said he has been working with students throughout the summer, and they've been holding virtual cooking classes, and the format is working.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Our whole classroom becomes a learning instrument. The floor, the maps, everything. We also incorporate the social, and emotional components so I make time for them to just hang out, five or ten minutes, because they don't get a chance to see each other so that's an important component as well, not just the learning, but to see their peers,\" he said.\n\nAli said Compton experiences unique challenges with distance learning while serving primarily Black and Brown students.\n\n\"This is an issue of education justice. We have to make certain that our students are competitive, not just regionally, but globally. Parents may not have the financial wherewithal to finance the supplemental tutors and support services at home or to hook up with the local pods, if you will, so because our students don't have that capability or that financial wherewithal, we have to provide that,\" said Ali.\n\nDr. Darin Brawley, the Superintendent of Compton Unified School District, said the district is working with large companies to provide devices to students.\n\n\"We've been able to incorporate technology for the vast majority of our students within the organization, actually all of them. We're doing a great job within Compton in terms of eliminating the opportunity gap within students, our students of Black and Brown origins. We feel that it's up to us to eliminate that opportunity gap so they're able to take advantage of the opportunities that exist within our global economy,\" said Brawley.\n\nKevin Curry, the Principal at Kelly Elementary, stressed the importance of making sure students have access.\n\n\"We have to make sure our students are given access to things that they might not have and we want to make sure we provide the service. It's our duty as a community, as a district to educate our students and if we're not then we're failing our community so this provides us another level of providing access,\" said Curry.\n\nCurry is a life-long Compton resident and said he takes pride in ensuring a good education for the students.\n\n\"Being someone who is born and raised in Compton, it is very impactful for me because I see my neighbors here, I see the students here. I went to school with their parents and I want to make sure I am doing right by these students,\" he said.\n\nSilvia Morua, a mother of three, talked to FOX 11 about the distance learning model at the district. She said it is difficult, but there are benefits.\n\n\"Everything is different. With the experience I have in my house, I think it's a good plan though. They [district] have help. The teachers make sure kids are doing their homework, and they help them and make sure they aren't playing around,\" said Morua in Spanish.\n\nIrma Martinez, another mother in the district, said it is a difficult adjustment.\n\n\"Personally, I don't like it. I know it's for the safety of the kids because of Covid, and that it's better for them to be in the house, but for me, it's very difficult to distance learn at home,\" she said in Spanish.\n\nDistrict leaders said they are working with students and parents to ensure the process runs smoothly. The first day of school is August 20.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//static.foxtv.com/static/orion/img/kttv/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//static.foxtv.com/static/orion/img/kttv/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//static.foxtv.com/static/orion/img/kttv/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//static.foxtv.com/static/orion/img/kttv/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "description": "The Compton Unified School District will start the fall semester next week, and will offer distance learning to students.", "fb": {"app_id": 115512618480878}, "prism.stationId": "KTTV_FOX11", "prism.stationCallSign": "kttv", "prism.channel": "fts", "prism.section": "news", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.creator": "Koco McAboy", "dc.title": "Compton Unified School District adapts to distance learning model", "dcterms.abstract": "The Compton Unified School District will start the fall semester next week, and will offer distance learning to students.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "The Compton Unified School District will start the fall semester next week, and will offer distance learning to students.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "FOX 11 Los Angeles", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:cae97c99-4be6-5f8b-b919-ff9c32ee37db", "dc.source": "FOX 11", "dc.date": "2020-08-14", "dcterms.created": "2020-08-14T18:29:40-07:00", "dcterms.modified": "2020-08-14T18:47:48-07:00", "og": {"title": "Compton Unified School District adapts to distance learning model", "description": "The Compton Unified School District will start the fall semester next week, and will offer distance learning to students.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.foxla.com/www.foxla.com/content/uploads/2020/08/1280/720/EBB19D806DE745269DF73EB64E52C925.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "url": "https://www.foxla.com/news/compton-unified-school-district-adapts-to-distance-learning-model", "site_name": "FOX 11 Los Angeles", "locale": "en_US"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "fox.app_version": "v77", "fox.app_build": "no build version", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"identifier": "@foxla", "id": "@foxla"}, "title": "Compton Unified School District adapts to distance learning model", "description": "The Compton Unified School District will start the fall semester next week, and will offer distance learning to students.", "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.foxla.com/www.foxla.com/content/uploads/2020/08/724/407/EBB19D806DE745269DF73EB64E52C925.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxla.com/news/compton-unified-school-district-adapts-to-distance-learning-model", "creator": {"identifier": "@foxla", "id": "@foxla"}}, "fox.name": "Post Landing", "fox.category": "news", "fox.page_content_category": "news", "fox.page_name": "kttv:web:post:article:Compton Unified School District adapts to distance learning model", "fox.page_content_level_1": "kttv:web:post", "fox.page_content_level_2": "kttv:web:post:article", "fox.page_content_level_3": "kttv:web:post:article:Compton Unified School District adapts to distance learning model", "fox.page_content_level_4": "kttv:web:post:article:Compton Unified School District adapts to distance learning model", "fox.page_type": "post-article", "fox.page_content_distributor": "owned", "fox.page_content_type_of_story": "Digital Original", "fox.author": "Koco McAboy", "fox.page_content_author": "Koco McAboy", "fox.page_content_version": "2.0.0", "fox.publisher": "FOX 11", "fox.page_content_id": "cae97c99-4be6-5f8b-b919-ff9c32ee37db", "fox.page_content_station_originator": "kttv", "fox.url": "https://www.foxla.com/news/compton-unified-school-district-adapts-to-distance-learning-model", "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FTS/Education,/FTS/News,/FTS/Health/Coronavirus/Schools", "classification-isa": "education,news,schools", "fox.page_content_tags": "/FTS/Education,/FTS/News,/FTS/Health/Coronavirus/Schools"}}}
