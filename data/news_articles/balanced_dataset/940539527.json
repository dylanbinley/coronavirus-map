Certain areas in Sweden and Denmark will be listed red as well. This was announced yesterday.\n\nNorway is battling its second wave of COVID-19 and is now advising its citizens not to travel abroad, having listed all previously green countries that aren\u2019t already red as yellow.\n\nPeople traveling from Iceland to Norway must now spend ten days in quarantine upon arrival in Norway. The reason Iceland has been listed as red is that the 14-day incidence of infections per 100,000 inhabitants in Iceland exceeds 20, which is the number of reference in Norway, when such decisions are made.\n\nThis number stands at 28.3 in Iceland. That includes the incidence of domestic infections as well as those at the border.\n\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Gu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson tells Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0 that Iceland will be removed from Norway\u2019s red list as long as the battle against the spread of COVID-19 continues to go well. There is a dialogue between officials in the two countries, he states.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the right track,\u201d Gu\u00f0laugur states, \u201cand if this development continues, we\u2019ll be taken off this [red] list.\u201d\n\nHe spoke to his Norwegian counterpart yesterday, and states that Prime Minister Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir spoke with Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg as well. There is a great deal of cooperation between the two countries.\n\nSince a week ago, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have listed Iceland as red, and Greenland now requires travelers from Iceland to be tested for the coronavirus at the border.\n\nThe latest figures on COVID-19 in Iceland show that six new domestic cases were confirmed yesterday, and four people who tested positive at the border are awaiting antibody results. There are currently 120 active cases of the disease in the country and one person remains in intensive care.", "METADATA": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#224499", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "title": "Norway to List Iceland as \u2018Red\u2019 - Iceland Monitor", "description": "As of midnight, Friday, Norway will list Iceland as \u2018red\u2019 on its coronavirus map.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 327183370784769}, "og": {"site_name": "Iceland Monitor", "image": "https://m2.mbl.is/fthPhk3CyY51YqR4o1pyfXckcf4=/fit-in/640x640/frimg/1/16/81/1168142.jpg", "title": "Norway to List Iceland as \u2018Red\u2019", "description": "As of midnight, Friday, Norway will list Iceland as \u2018red\u2019 on its coronavirus map.", "type": "article", "url": "https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2020/08/13/norway_to_list_iceland_as_red/"}, "google-site-verification": "GgwRR4GrUmcESOQRz1lMNd-m1atKf3lRYyo3wAbN7fg", "keywords": "in-depth Iceland news coverage, Iceland weather forecast and information", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "As of midnight, Friday, Norway will list Iceland as \u2018red\u2019 on its coronavirus map.", "title": "Norway to List Iceland as \u2018Red\u2019", "image": "https://cdn.mbl.is/frimg/1/16/81/1168142.jpg"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": true, "NOTES": []}}
