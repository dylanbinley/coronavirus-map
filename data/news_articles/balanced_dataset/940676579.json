(Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nIn her first speech since Joe Biden selected her as his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris told multiple lies. To wit:\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s mismanagement of the pandemic has plunged us into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,\u201d Harris said.\n\nFalse. The pandemic and its associated lockdowns, not the president, are responsible for the economic contraction. Donald Trump is not the president of the euro zone, which suffered through an even more dire economic contraction in the second quarter: minus 40.3 percent, on an annualized basis, as against minus 32.9 percent in the US. The U.K. suffered a contraction of 59.8 percent, also on an annualized basis. Donald Trump is not the prime minister of the United Kingdom. The U.S. economy did slightly better than Germany\u2019s in the second quarter. And it\u2019s questionable to compare the current crisis to the Great Depression, which was not only deep but lasted more than a decade. The U.S. added 1.8 million jobs in July and Goldman Sachs predicts 25 percent (annualized) GDP growth in the current third quarter, which would mark an end to the U.S. recession after two quarters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cJust look where [Trump and Mike Pence] have gotten us. . . . Millions of kids who cannot go back to school,\u201d Harris said.\n\nWrong. It is not Donald Trump\u2019s decision whether kids go back to school, because the federal government does not run schools, but he has urged the schools to reopen. The primary reason kids cannot go back to school is opposition from teachers\u2019 unions. The second-largest teachers\u2019 union is threatening to strike if schools reopen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSix years ago, in fact, we had a different health crisis,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt was called Ebola. We all remember that pandemic.\u201d\n\nIncorrect. Ebola was an outbreak, not a pandemic, according to the World Health Organization.\n\n\u201cThis virus has impacted almost every country,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a reason it has hit America worse than any other advanced nation. It\u2019s because of Trump\u2019s failure to take it seriously.\u201d\n\nWrong. Several advanced nations have suffered more fatalities per million population than the U.S.: Belgium, the U.K., Spain, Italy, Sweden. Donald Trump is not in charge of any of these countries.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/themes/national-review/static/images/favicons/favicon-96x96.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "google-site-verification": "0p9SDHXWowdbrg4wkf-aR1ejmq4mTT8io_fKCQrRjg0", "description": "Several advanced nations have suffered more fatalities per million population than the U.S.: Belgium, the U.K., Spain, Italy, Sweden.
