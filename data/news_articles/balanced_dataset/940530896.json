It said evidence in the broader area showed \u201coccupation of the surrounding landscape has been ongoing for approximately 40,000 years\u201d.\n\nBHP to destroy at least 40 Aboriginal sites, up to 15,000 years old, to expand Pilbara mine Read more\n\nLess than a day after the revelations surfaced, BHP issued a clarification that it would not damage the sites without \u201cfurther extensive consultation\u201d with traditional owners.\n\n\u201cWhile BHP committed to not undertake activities which would disturb 40 cultural heritage sites in the Pilbara \u2026 decisions about cultural heritage should be based on principles, not on a PR response to a crisis,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\nA BHP spokesman said the company\u2019s engagement with traditional owners was \u201cbased on deep respect and a commitment to understanding the cultural significance of their country and heritage\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn relation to the resolutions, we have a regular dialogue with our investors and consult with them regularly on a full range of matters relating to our business, including our approach to cultural heritage,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Banjima native title holders told the Western Australian government in April they did not want any of the sites to be damaged, saying the \u201cimpending harm\u201d to the area \u201cis a further significant cumulative loss to the cultural values of the Banjima people\u201d.\n\nBut under section 18 of the WA Aboriginal Heritage Act, traditional owners are unable to lodge objections or to prevent their sacred sites from being damaged.\n\nThe Banjima are also unable to raise concerns publicly about the expansion, having signed comprehensive agreements with BHP as part of a native title settlement.\n\nThe Banjima wrote to the WA government in April to say they \u201cin no way support the continued destruction of this significant cultural landscape\u201d but \u201care equally aware\u201d they cannot formally object to the section 18 application.\n\nThe ACCR resolution called on BHP to remove the \u201cgag orders\u201d on traditional owners \u201cso they can speak publicly about cultural heritage concerns on their land\u201d.\n\nBHP agrees not to damage 40 Aboriginal heritage sites without consulting traditional owners Read more\n\nBHP said it had a 20-year relationship with the Banjima people and that the agreement signed in 2015 over the South Flank mine was consistent with principles of self-determination.\n\nProf Marcia Langton, who supported the resolution, said it reminded companies such as Rio Tinto and BHP there are modern standards of human rights obligations for businesses that Australian companies have signed up to.\n\n\u201cThey have obligations to respect the cultural rights of Indigenous people, and obligations to protect their cultural heritage in their operations,\u201d Langton said.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that Juukan Gorge has revealed the many ways in which Rio has fallen below the bar on those standards, and it and other companies have a lot of work to do to demonstrate to shareholders that they are delivering on their commitments.\n\nThe public response around the world has come as \u201ca bit of a shock\u201d to mining companies, Langton said.\n\n\u201cThere are people in the mining industry to whom these commitments are somehow optional, and their contempt for Aboriginal cultural heritage is widely shared, so that public reaction of horror has snapped them back into a state of reality,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to see that BHP has made a public statement to consult with traditional owners and that\u2019s what is required at a very minimum,\u201d she said.\n\nThe WA minister for Aboriginal affairs, Ben Wyatt, confirmed he approved the South Flank expansion on 29 May, three days after the destruction of Juukan Gorge made global headlines, but said he has since urged BHP to cooperate with the Banjima under what are now \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d.\n\nWyatt told a Senate inquiry last week that reforms to WA heritage laws will end the section 18 process.", "METADATA": {"description": "The move follows the blasting of Juukan
