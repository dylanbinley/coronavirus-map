This episode of Byzantium & Friends features a conversation with Dimitris Krallis, which ranges from statues and streets to politics and Church politics in particular, drawing on our own experiences and training as Byzantinists. There is a lot more that we could say about this fascinating topic, but we explore various domains where Byzantium is alive or long gone, or where it shambles on in zombie form.\n\nDimitris Krallis is a Professor and Director of the SNF Centre for Hellenic Studies at Simon Fraser University. His latest book is Serving Byzantium\u2019s Emperors: The Courtly Life and Career of Michael Attaleiates, and he translated with Anthony Kaldellis The History by Michael Attaleiates.

You can follow him on his personal website.\n\nYou can listen to more episodes of Byzantium & Friends through Podbean.\n\nTop Image: The Church of Panagia Kapnikarea in Athens \u2013 this Byzantine church dates back to the 11th century.
