Lines Ltd., was carrying a total of some 3,800 tons of fuel oil when it ran aground on July 25. Leakage began last week when one of the five fuel tanks suffered a crack.\n\nThe Mauritius authorities have been working to withdraw the remaining oil from the ship's undamaged tanks and the government said Wednesday that the operations were almost complete.", "METADATA": {"csrf-token": "lSPY1QNn0UPBDLjK6Wb2t64DHmVrAv4ChImVgP6A", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Kyodo News+", "keywords": "oil leakage, Japan freighter, Mauritius oil, Mauritius ship, leakage compensation, Japan Mauritius", "description": "A Japanese company whose freighter remains stranded after running aground off Mauritius says it will deal \"in good faith\" with the issue of compensation over oil leakage.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,minimum-scale=1.0", "block_download_image": 1, "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "application-name": "Kyodo News+", "author": "KYODO NEWS", "og": {"url": "https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/08/a0e87b487aff-update1-owner-of-stranded-japanese-ship-to-address-remedy-for-oil-leakage.html", "type": "article", "title": "Owner of stranded Japanese ship to address remedy for oil leakage", "description": "A Japanese company whose freighter remains stranded after running aground off Mauritius says it will deal \"in good faith\" with the issue of compensation over oil leakage.", "image": "https://img.kyodonews.net/english/public/images/posts/87af97992ca1b3f68cf8c986074b465b/cropped_image_l.jpg", "site_name": "Kyodo News+", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kyodo_official", "url": "https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/08/a0e87b487aff-update1-owner-of-stranded-japanese-ship-to-address-remedy-for-oil-leakage.html", "title": "Owner of stranded Japanese ship to address remedy for oil leakage", "description": "A Japanese company whose freighter remains stranded after running aground off Mauritius says it will deal \"in good faith\" with the issue of compensation over oil leakage.", "image": "https://img.kyodonews.net/english/public/images/posts/87af97992ca1b3f68cf8c986074b465b/cropped_image_l.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}}}}
