REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, have been cutting output since May by around 10% of typical global demand to tackle the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLast month, the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) a ministerial advisory panel to OPEC+, decided to ease the cuts beginning this month to around to 7.7 million barrels per day (bpd) until December from a previous reduction of 9.7 million bpd.\n\nNovak said there have been no additional proposals to change the deal among OPEC+ producers, the reports said.\n\n\u201cI think no-one is putting forward any hasty moves, additional proposals,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market is more or less stable and we are seeing gradual balancing.\u201d\n\nThe JMMC is scheduled to convene next week against the backdrop of an oil price recovery to above $45 a barrel from a 21-year low of below $16 in April.\n\nNovak said the meeting could be delayed to Aug. 19 from the initially planned Aug. 18.\n\nRussia\u2019s flagship Urals crude oil blend is under pressure as its top buyers in Europe scramble for better refining margins by replacing Urals with cheaper grades including light oils coming from the United States, Kazakhstan and even gas condensate, traders said.\n\nUrals for loading from Baltic Sea ports is now $0.55 per barrel cheaper than Brent and down from record-high premiums seen in June.\n\nAt the same time, condensate is being offered at $5 per barrel below Brent, traders said.", "METADATA": {"robots": "index, follow",
