Morse has been the mayor of Holyoke, a city of 40,000 near Springfield, for nearly a decade.\n\nThe allegations, revealed in an article in The Massachusetts Daily Collegian, claimed that Morse had matched with college students on dating apps, attempted to contact students he met through campus events and had inappropriate relationships with students at UMass Amherst, where he taught a course on urban government. In that article, Morse said he had relationships with college students but they were consensual.\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nBut on Wednesday, an article in The Intercept said that College Democrats had been discussing a plan to attack Morse since last year. The article said that leaders of the group discussed finding Morse\u2019s dating profiles in an attempt to get him to say something inappropriate to damage his campaign. The group\u2019s chief strategist, Timothy Ennis, allegedly claimed in group chats that he was attempting to secure an internship with Rep. Richard Neal, the centrist Democrat whom Morse is seeking to unseat. The Neal campaign has denied any collaboration with the students.\n\nPolitico reported that the Massachusetts Democratic Party plans to investigate the college Democrats who accused Morse of misconduct \u2014 but not until after the September 1 primary.\n\nMorse was elected mayor of Holyoke, his hometown, at 22, becoming the youngest and first openly gay person to lead the city. He has aligned himself with \u201cthe Squad,\u201d a quartet of progressive congresswomen of color. In an interview with the Jewish Telegraphic Agency last month, he defended the four representatives against accusations that their criticism of Israel veered into anti-Semitism.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=1024", "description": "Group that accused Jewish progressive of inappropriate relationships with college students revealed to be behind year-long effort to discredit him, actively sought to entrap him", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/images/toi_icon_144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 123142304440875}, "og": {"url": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-claims-against-congressional-candidate-morse-concocted-to-boost-opponent/", "type": "article", "title": "Report: Claims against congressional candidate Morse concocted to boost opponent", "description": "Group that accused Jewish progressive of inappropriate relationships with college students revealed to be behind year-long effort to discredit him, actively sought to entrap him", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2020/08/7-22-20-morse2-1024x640.jpeg", "width": 1024, "height": 640}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "timesofisrael", "title": "Report: Claims against congressional candidate Morse concocted to boost opponent", "description": "Group that accused Jewish progressive of inappropriate relationships with college students revealed to be behind year-long effort to discredit him, actively sought to entrap him", "image": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2020/08/7-22-20-morse2-1024x640.jpeg"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
