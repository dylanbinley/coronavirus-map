If we deploy our barges it mean about hundred trucks are also off the road. So the kiosk of gridlock is a function of inefficiency and lack of planning, \u201che said.\n\nAccepting the challenged to come up with plan to commence delivering cargo via inland water ways, the Managing Director, NIWA, Dr. George Moghalu, said it has issued an order to ensure all operators comply with necessary laws regarding safety in view of recurrent accidents in the nation \u2018s water ways.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2019/09/d9ebcb95-calabar-seaport.jpg", "secure_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2019/09/d9ebcb95-calabar-seaport.jpg", "width": 727, "height": 465}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "FG Agencies Move to Enforce 24 Hours Port Operation - THISDAYLIVE", "description": "By Eromosele Abiodun and Oluchi Chibuzor Following the Executive Order on ease of doing business across the nation\u2019s seaports that was signed by the Vice President, Prof Yemi Oshinbajo in 2017, heads of federal government agencies in the maritime sector have resolved to implement actionable plans towards a 24 hours port operations.
