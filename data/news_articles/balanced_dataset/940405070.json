In the past, each service trained on its own with command centralized at the brigade level.\n\nNews reports indicate the joint battalions will be equipped with unmanned aerial systems and operators, have attached sniper teams and move about in wheeled armored vehicles. The battalions will also have with them man-portable air-defense Stinger missiles.\n\nIn July, Taiwan tested its asymmetric concepts during the latest Han Kuang exercise series, which simulated a coastal attack from mainland China, as an example of the shift from heavy armored forces to integrated asymmetric defense.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201ctransformation of our military into a more effective force\u201d in defending Taiwan, she said. In its shift to an all-volunteer force, the reserves have been used mostly in response to natural or humanitarian disasters.\n\nBi-Khim Hsiao, Taiwan\u2019s representative to the United States, said the pressures Taiwan is facing militarily from Beijing have been on the upswing since the COVID-19 pandemic. She and Tsai cited China\u2019s assertiveness in the Himalayas with India to the South China Sea.\n\n\u201cThere is an increasing risk of miscalculation\u201d on China\u2019s part with its daily incursions with air and naval forces in the straits and off the island, Hsiao said. Beijing has begun sea trials on its newest amphibious assault ship, raising new concerns in Washington and Taipei over China\u2019s intentions on the future of Taiwan.\n\nThe emphasis of asymmetrical capabilities in island defense is to \u201cmake any consideration of invasion very painful\u201d to Beijing, she said. Hsiao added that raising the standards for the reserve forces to include drawing on their civilian skills in cyber security shows new resolve to defend Taiwan against direct invasion and digital attack.\n\nHsiao said Taiwan\u2019s geographic position in the \u201cfirst island chain\u201d from the Chinese mainland shows its importance as a stakeholder in the affairs of the East and South China seas. She noted that Beijing\u2019s \u201cnaval capacity is now reaching the \u2018third island chain\u2019 Hawaii.\u201d This reach, coupled with its aggressive behavior off Malaysia in the South China Sea, brought new focus on stability in those waters.\n\nFrom the Taiwan Straits to the South China Sea, \u201cTaiwan and the United States have overlapping interests,\u201d she said, \u201cbut with very different perspectives.\u201d The overlapping interests include ensuring trade moves smoothly through international waters. She added Japan and India share these interests.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s goal \u201cis to jointly secure stability in the region at large,\u201d Hsiao said.\n\nAt the same time, as talks over trade continue, \u201cwe\u2019ve had very frank and open discussions with the United States over the modernization of our military.\u201d Hsiao added these talks also included what necessary changes needed to be made to professionalize its all-volunteer force. \u201cWe believe this is a positive step,\u201d she said.\n\nSince Taiwan reduced its reliance on the draft, the island has had difficulty recruiting and retaining an all-volunteer force, Tsai acknowledged in her remarks; but improved pay and opportunities for those who commit to four-year enlistments are starting to turn that around.\n\n\u201cOur democracy is under constant challenge\u201d that requires a well-trained force and informed electorate, Hsiao added.\n\nThe challenge includes disinformation campaigns and fake news blanketing the island through social media. This \u201chybrid threat\u201d is an \u201cinfiltration into our civil society\u201d with the goal of undermining Taiwan\u2019s democracy, she said.\n\nLooking ahead in her second term, Tsai said, \u201cI fully expect this number to grow,\u201d referring to Taiwan\u2019s spending on defense. In a run-up to the presidential election, China sent its aircraft carrier Shandong through the Taiwan Straits to intimidate island voters. Since then, Beijing has also pressured more countries to drop diplomatic recognition of Taiwan, while at the same time blocking its participation in international organizations.\n\nAnother reason to believe defense spending will rise for the foreseeable future is Beijing\u2019s insistence on direct control over affairs it considers China\u2019s alone. The example she used was the crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong under the newly passed internal security law, effectively ends the \u201cone country/two policies\u201d approach to governance.\n\nChina\u2019s ruling party regards the 23 million residents of Taiwan as living in a breakaway province.\n\nAlthough the United States has had a \u201cone-China\u201d policy since 1979, the Taiwan Relations Act allows substantial non-diplomatic interchange to include defense sales between Washington and Taipei.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Taiwan Retooling Defenses to Counter a \u2018Belligerent\u2019 China - USNI News", "description": "Taiwan is emphasizing asymmetric defenses from mines to anti-ship missiles, overhauling its reserve forces and professionalizing its military structure to better defend itself from \u201ca more belligerent and aggressive\u201d China, the island\u2019s president said Wednesday.
