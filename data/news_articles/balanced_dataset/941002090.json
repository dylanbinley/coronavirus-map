It is an unforgettable piece of headwear \u2013 and the Duchess of Cornwall proved it yesterday when she wore the dramatic Philip Treacy hat for the 11th time. She teamed the custom-made hat, which features an ostrich feather wrapped around the brim, with a cream silk printed dress and cream coat with braided trim for her appearance at yesterday\u2019s VJ Day remembrance ceremony. Royal watchers could be forgiven for doing a double-take as she wore the same outfit (save for a brooch) to honour recipients of the Victoria and George Cross in May 2018. The dress and coat are by Fiona Clare, one of her favourite designers, and the shoes are by Sole Bliss. The Duchess first wore the hat 14 years ago for a Garter Day service and it has proved a firm favourite since. Two years ago, she picked it for a service at St Martin-in-the-Fields in London for the Victoria and George Cross Association, of which Prince Charles is patron.
