This used to happen and the operations would often go wrong, making any hope of a cure more remote. We need properly trained and equipped doctors.\n\nThe Impact of COVID-19\n\nA woman with obstetric fistula is one of the most desperate and needy of patients.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and the lockdowns in place have made the plight of fistula patients all the more acute. From my own perspective, I was due to travel to Uganda, South Sudan and Tanzania to operate on over 90 patients. The borders of those countries closed so I was unable to go and the patients had to return home. It is devastating for them to have their hope of help deferred.\n\nMany outreach programs that find and refer fistula patients for help are now closed, patients cannot travel to hospitals and there are fewer aid donations as the world's economy is shrinking. Fistula patients will suffer as a result.\n\nI also hear that in certain places women are scared to deliver in hospitals, as they are afraid of the virus. There are reports of women dying at home trying to have a baby and I am certain more will be getting fistulas too.\n\nI am sure there will be a lot more catching up to do after the COVID-19 crisis passes. We cannot help all of the women who need fistula surgery without the FIGO Fellows who have been through and are involved in the training program.\n\nInternational Day to End Obstetric Fistula\n\nThe International Day to End Obstetric Fistula helps to keep the fistula patient and her plight in the public eye, otherwise they run the risk of being forgotten, especially at times like this.\n\nThe FIGO Fistula Surgery Training Initiative is a globally recognised, state-of-the-art training programme. Using FIGO\u2019s Global Competency-Based Fistula Surgery Training Manual, the world\u2019s first standardised curriculum, we deliver training, education and research.
