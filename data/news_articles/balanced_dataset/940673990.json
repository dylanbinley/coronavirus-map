This was their first meeting after a week.\n\nThe details of the meeting have not been disclosed. The sources close to the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) said the talk ended on a positive note. Sources said as Prime Minister Oli agreed to hand over the total command of the party to Prachanda during the meeting, an agreement could be closer.\n\nThe leaders are expected to meet on Friday too.\n\nOli during a television interview on Wednesday said that the ongoing intra-party tussle will be settled down within five days. Oli and Prachanda have held at least ten meetings in recent weeks to sort out the differences between them. But, as the Prime Minister did not accept the condition of a one-man-one-post, the talks failed. Oli has refused to give up his post as prime minister as well as a co-chairman of the NCP.\n\nA bitter internal feud has been brewing in the ruling NCP since the last few weeks after top party leaders, including Prachanda, demanded Oli\u2019s resignation, saying his recent anti-India remarks were \u201cneither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriate.\u201d They are also against Oli\u2019s autocratic style of functioning.\n\nThe differences grew further after Oli said that some of the ruling party leaders are aligning with the southern neighbour to remove him from power after his government issued a new political map incorporating three Indian territories of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura.\n\nThe two leaders are also engaged in tightening their grip within the party with the escalation of the intra-party feud.", "METADATA": {"google-site-verification": "U3xIlrlaetYrU7V1lNSFthKZzBFJ_S6qVzdn_gpMNjc", "keywords": "K P Sharma Oli, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, India Nepal new maps", "news_keywords": "K P Sharma Oli, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, India Nepal new maps", "description": "The two leaders one-on-one meeting at the Prime Minister\u2019s residence at Baluwatar in Kathmandu.
