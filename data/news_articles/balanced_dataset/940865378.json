It\u0092s the bug thing that got me. I was interested.\u0094\n\nWalter Roban, the Minister of Home Affairs, said Mr Hill had persisted where bigger importers had not.\n\nMr Roban added: \u0093He did what was necessary to succeed. He and the people he worked with should be congratulated.\u0094\n\nTerry Lynn Thompson, the acting director of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, said: \u0093We hope to continue working with importers like Mr Hill and anyone else who can import clean bananas successfully because Bermudians really love their bananas.\u0094\n\nMr Roban added: \u0093Plant biosecurity is of paramount importance to any country, to safeguard food security, sustainability of agricultural and horticultural production, and also protect the livelihood of farmers and landscapers.\u0094\n\nHe said produce imported to Bermuda must be pre-inspected in the country of origin and was inspected again on arrival by staff at Bermuda\u0092s plant protection department, part of the DENR.\n\nMr Roban said the procedures were \u0093meticulous and rigid\u0094, and the plant protection department was \u0093acclaimed internationally and regionally\u0094 for its efficiency.\n\nMr Hill added it was vital that Bermuda continued its rigorous testing regime. He said: \u0093Most Caribbean islands have major problems with mealybugs.\n\n\u0093Bermuda does a good job. We can\u0092t let our guard down. We have to keep clean product coming.\u0094\n\nMr Roban said the Covid-19 pandemic had underlined the \u0093need for clean, safe and healthy food\u0094.\n\nHe added that a government study of the island\u0092s agricultural sector would be \u0093finished very soon\u0094.\n\nMr Roban said 700 acres of land in Bermuda were zoned for agriculture, but only half were farmed.\n\nHe added soil content and other factors were being assessed to decide if more land was suitable for farming.\n\nMr Roban said: \u0093We can clearly do more but it\u0092s how we do more and where we do more.\u0094\n\nHe added: \u0093We believe there is an opportunity for new farmers to come into the market.\u0094\n\nMr Roban said the use of extra farmland would require \u0093preparation, training and investment\u0094.\n\nHe added: \u0093As a government we are also committed to aquaculture, mariculture, vertical farming, and hydroponics.\u0094\n\nMr Hill said: \u0093Greenhouse farming is the way to go. Hydroponics is the way to go. You will see more greenhouses popping up. There is a lot we can do.\u0094\n\nMr Roban said 80 per cent of Mr Hill\u0092s banana shipment had been inspected, with the rest be inspected by the end of today.", "METADATA": {"robots": "noarchive", "description": "Supplying Bermuda with imported bananas for the first time in months was not without risk, farmer and entrepreneur Roland \"Junior\" Hill said yesterday.Mr Hill said he took a \"big chance - there was a lot of money on the line\".But he added: \"It paid off, it did, it worked well. \"I think we should be happy for Bermuda; we made a lot of people happy this week.\"Mr Hill\u2019s 42,000-pound shipment from Costa Rica arrived on the docks on Sunday and was in stores by Tuesday after passing", "keywords": "Economy, business and finance, Agriculture, Arable farming  People and Places, People, Walter Roban", "fb": {"app_id": 502972206505241, "admins": 100000553573348}, "og": {"title": "Hill's banana deal pays off | The Royal Gazette:Bermuda News", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.royalgazette.com/storyimage/RG/20200815/NEWS/200819861/AR/0/AR-200819861.jpg", "url": "http://www.royalgazette.com/news/article/20200815/hills-banana-deal-pays-off", "site_name": "The Royal Gazette", "description": "Supplying Bermuda with imported bananas for the first time in months was not without risk, farmer and entrepreneur Roland \"Junior\" Hill said yesterday.Mr Hill said he took a \"big chance - there was a lot of money on the line\".But he added: \"It paid off, it did, it worked well. \"I think we should be happy for Bermuda; we made a lot of people happy this week.\"Mr Hill\u2019s 42,000-pound shipment from Costa Rica arrived on the docks on Sunday and was in stores by Tuesday after passing"}}}}
