If you are dumb and don\u2019t understand the rules don\u2019t say things you do not know. \u201cJB is just wasting everybody\u2019s time. He knew he was going to lose the election which is why he sponsored his people to go to court.\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer GhanaWeb is not responsible for the reportage or opinions of contributors published on the website.
