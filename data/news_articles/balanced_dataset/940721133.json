We have to make a decision on it and we have to do that based on science and medicine, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve taken the advice and implemented on that basis.\u201d\n\nThe move, which applies throughout the UK, comes after Boris Johnson promised to be \u201cabsolutely ruthless\u201d in decisions about imposing new quarantine restrictions.\n\nThe Joint Biosecurity Centre and Public Health England detected a significant change in Covid-19 risk in all six destinations.\n\nDepartment for Transport officials said data from France shows that over the past week there has been a 66% increase in newly reported Covid-19 cases and a 52% increase in the weekly incidence rate per 100,000 population, indicating a sharp rise in infections.\n\nThe latest 14-day cumulative figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control show 32.1 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in France, compared with 18.5 in the UK.\n\nThe move will come as a bitter blow to the hard-pressed French tourism industry which relies heavily on visitors from the UK.\n\nFrance\u2019s secretary of state for European affairs said the UK decision would lead to \u201creciprocal measures\u201d across the Channel.\n\nClement Beaune tweeted: \u201cA British decision which we regret and which will lead to reciprocal measures, all in hoping for a return for normal as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nVehicles are driven off of a ferry at Dover after arriving from France on Friday (Gareth Fuller/PA)\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Scotland on Friday morning, Humza Yousaf, Scotland\u2019s cabinet secretary for justice, said: \u201cThese are very difficult decisions that we make.\n\n\u201cWe make them based on the data we get in front of us and we received data from the French government yesterday evening and it\u2019s very clear from the analysis that we had to act and act quickly.\n\n\u201cThere is a period, a window, for them (travellers) to get back. But I\u2019m afraid if they can\u2019t get back before that, they will have to self-isolate for 14 days.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing additional that we will be able to do in terms of flights or by other ports of entry such as sea or rail \u2013 certainly nothing the Scottish Government can do.\u201d\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nThe decision to add the Netherlands was made after a 52% increase in newly reported cases between August 7 and 13 after a consistent series of rises in previous weeks.\n\nOver the past week, there has been a 273% increase in newly reported cases in Turks & Caicos, a 1,106% increase in Aruba and a 105% rise in Malta.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "wBs4lXcL3o2OJ760vq8D8EjRvWpujRCD3Qwq6NdgnxM", "twitter": {"image": "https://www.expressandstar.com/resizer/aniM5Os-X22uorZrIvANWfyisFE=/1200x0/filters:quality(100)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/expressandstar.mna/DGOD7ZMX6BF3LPLUWGZTWKLVKU.jpg", "site": "ExpressandStar", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Britons in France being charged hundreds of pounds to avoid quarantine", "description": "Air fares are more than six times higher than normal for flights from Paris to London on Friday."}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Britons in France being charged hundreds of pounds to avoid quarantine", "description": "Air fares are more than six times higher than normal for flights from Paris to London on Friday.", "image": "https://www.expressandstar.com/resizer/aniM5Os-X22uorZrIvANWfyisFE=/1200x0/filters:quality(100)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/expressandstar.mna/DGOD7ZMX6BF3LPLUWGZTWKLVKU.jpg", "url": "https://www.expressandstar.com/news/uk-news/2020/08/14/britons-in-france-being-charged-hundreds-of-pounds-to-avoid-quarantine/"}, "pb": {"page-type": "story"}, "fb": {"app_id": 123889550967511}, "description": "Air fares are more than six times higher than normal for flights from Paris to London on Friday.", "pb-site": "/news/health/coronavirus-covid19", "story": {"": {"premium-flag": "Free"}}, "dfp": {"page-type": "story", "slot": "/news/health/coronavirus-covid19", "story": "[\"DSKHH3Y4QRGIBBAO7GULDYACLY\",\"/news/uk-news/2020/08/14/britons-in-france-being-charged-hundreds-of-pounds-to-avoid-quarantine/\"]", "sites": "[\"/news/health/coronavirus-covid19\",\"/news\",\"/news/health\",\"/news/health\",\"/news\",\"/news\",\"/news/politics\",\"/news\",\"/news/transport\",\"/news\",\"/news/uk-news\",\"/news\",\"/top-stories/homepage\",\"/top-stories\",\"/top-stories\"]"}}}}
