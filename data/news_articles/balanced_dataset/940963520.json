This is livelihood of Nigerians being destroyed by Ghanaian Authorities. This is not being perpetrated by a trade union, but Ghanaian authorities.\n\n\u201cThey demanded that we must employ a minimum of 25 skilled Ghanaian workers and must not trade in commodities that Ghanaian traders have applied to trade in,\u201d Nnaji said.\n\n\u201cThe humiliation of Nigerians is getting out of hand. We are calling on the Nigerian government to come to our aid.\n\n\u201dWe have legally registered our businesses and we pay taxes,\u201d Nnaji said.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "DC.Identifier": "cd7fc698-1c32-4baa-bf08-9bb8bdfbecfc", "description": "Nnaji says Nigerian traders in Accra were locked up by Ghanaian authorities who demanded cash payment of one million dollars from them.", "og": {"title": "Nigerian traders in Ghana decry closure of their shops by Ghanaian authorities", "description": "Nnaji says Nigerian traders in Accra were locked up by Ghanaian authorities who demanded cash payment of one million dollars from them.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/uP9ktkpTURBXy80Yzg2ZjExMDM5N2JjMGJlNjczYTdhYjNlMjQwOWQzOS5qcGeSlQMAAM0DFM0Bu5MFzQSwzQJ2", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.pulse.ng/business/nigerian-traders-in-ghana-decry-closure-of-their-shops-by-ghanaian-authorities/xcpxmvc", "type": "article", "site_name": "Pulse Nigeria", "locale": "en_EN"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-15 16:44:16+0200"}, "fb": {"app_id": 357752217891027, "pages": 163781703715266}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Nnaji says Nigerian traders in Accra were locked up by Ghanaian authorities who demanded cash payment of one million dollars from them.", "title": "Nigerian traders in Ghana decry closure of their shops by Ghanaian authorities", "site": "PulseNigeria247", "image": "https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/0PbktkpTURBXy80Yzg2ZjExMDM5N2JjMGJlNjczYTdhYjNlMjQwOWQzOS5qcGeSlQMAAM0DFM0Bu5MFzQHgzQFo"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#000000"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
