Because the incorrect official assumed the title of Acting Secretary at that time, subsequent amendments to the order of succession made by that official were invalid and officials who assumed their positions under such amendments, including Chad Wolf and Kenneth Cuccinelli, were named by reference to an invalid order of succession. We have not reviewed the legality of other actions taken by these officials; we are referring the matter to the Inspector General of DHS for review.\n\nThe Democratic lawmakers who demanded the review of the appointments seized upon the GAO determination as evidence that both Wolf and Cuccinelli should step down.\n\nThe decision \u201cpaints a disturbing picture of the Trump administration playing fast and loose by bypassing the Senate confirmation process to install ideologues,\u201d Reps. Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.) and Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAt a time when DHS should be marshaling the resources of the federal government to respond to the pandemic that has killed over 165,000 Americans, the department\u2019s illegally appointed leaders are instead focused on continuing the administration\u2019s attack on immigrants and intimidating peaceful protesters in a show of force for the president\u2019s reelection campaign,\u201d the lawmakers said.\n\nAdvocacy groups weighed in on the development as well, with immigrant rights groups calling it \u201cBIG news as it\u2019ll effect a variety of pending lawsuits raising similar challenges.\u201d\n\nAccording to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), the GAO decision \u201craises serious legal questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere must be accountability,\u201d the group said.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet.org", "title": "New report reveals that Trump's top Homeland Security officials are in their positions illegally", "url": "https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/internal-watchdog-reveals-that-trumps-top-homeland-security-officials-are-in-their-positions-illegally/", "type": "article", "description": "The Trump administration's top officials at the Department of Homeland Security\u2014Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Acting Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli\u2014were illegally appointed to their positions, the Government Accountability Office\u00a0said\u00a0Friday.\r\n\r\nThe decision from the internal gov", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.alternet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/chad.jpg", "url": "https://www.alternet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/chad.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.alternet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/chad.jpg"}, "updated_time": "2020-08-14T23:45:02+00:00"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T23:43:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T23:45:02+00:00"}, "twitter": {"title": "New report reveals that Trump's top Homeland Security officials are in their positions illegally", "url": "https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/internal-watchdog-reveals-that-trumps-top-homeland-security-officials-are-in-their-positions-illegally/", "description": "The Trump administration's top officials at the Department of Homeland Security\u2014Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Acting Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli\u2014were illegally appointed to their positions, the Government Accountability Office\u00a0said\u00a0Friday.\r\n\r\nThe decision from the internal gov", "image": "https://www.alternet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/chad.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}}}}
