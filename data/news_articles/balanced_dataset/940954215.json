They see it as a positive move for both of them and the separation is completely amicable.\n\n\"Their children are their top priority and they will continue to co-parent as good friends.\"\n\nLast year, the 40-year-old star confessed that she wanted a break from police roles after a string of similar projects.\n\n\"I play a detective inspector in Liar 2, I play a DI in this [Criminal], I have to draw the line now!\" she told Digital Spy. \"I need a break! I think they are so popular, the police procedurals, all actors do them, and if you didn't, you wouldn't work otherwise!\"\n\nNetflix\n\nRelated: Katherine Kelly gives update on Happy Valley season 3\n\nKatherine further explained: \"And you do switch from side to side, and I'm definitely ready for a bit more on the other side [as a suspect]. I'm joking about it, my character in Liar is nowhere near as repressed as Hobbs [in Criminal] \u2013 they're very different.\n\n\"But I definitely like to do what I haven't done, and I mean that in theatre, TV and radio \u2013 not just the part, the project too.\"\n\n\n\nDigital Spy has launched its first-ever digital magazine with exclusive features, interviews, and videos.
