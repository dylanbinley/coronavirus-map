This should not be a diplomatic problem,\u201d internal affairs minister Sanae Takaichi told reporters after praying at the shrine.\n\nKosaburo Tanaka, a martial arts association manager, travelled from Osaka to give thanks for Japan\u2019s postwar peace.\n\n\u201cJapan hasn\u2019t been in any war over the last 75 years and we were able to live peacefully. I think that\u2019s all because of the spirits that rest here in Yasukuni.
