Members of Parliament within Johnson\u2019s own Conservative Party argued that London\u2019s best interests lie in a closer trade bloc with Washington.\n\nNegotiations between the two governments are underway. Both say a deal is unlikely before the U.S. elections in November, as disputes remain over the U.S. bosses\u2019 access to agricultural and pharmaceutical markets in the U.K., among other issues. Washington opposes the U.K. government\u2019s tax on online purchases, which especially impacts companies like Amazon and Apple.\n\nThe Johnson government says its U-turn on Huawei was in response to U.S. sanctions on the company imposed in May. But the reasons are more fundamental.\n\nThe U.S. rulers see Beijing as a growing threat to the dominance they wrested with their victory in the second imperialist world war, and see Huawei\u2019s expansion as a particular danger. Washington accuses the company of stealing trade secrets to \u201cback engineer\u201d U.S. products, of engaging in industrial espionage, and being linked to the Chinese government\u2019s cyberwarfare programs. The U.S. rulers view Beijing\u2019s efforts as part of circumventing Washington\u2019s sanctions on Iran.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had spoken out against the Johnson government for its January decision.\n\nWashington has already received backing in its campaign against Huawei from the governments of Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Along with the U.S. and U.K., they make up the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d international intelligence and security cooperation bloc.\n\nThe ban on Huawei is part of a shift in London\u2019s policies to a more hostile stance toward Beijing. The British government now plans to deploy a new aircraft carrier in the South China Sea. And it has offered a fast-track to citizenship for 3 million Hong Kong residents after the Chinese rulers imposed sweeping security restrictions in Hong Kong aimed at crushing political opposition. Beijing has condemned both U.K. government moves.\n\nThese steps are a sea change from the relations established with Beijing by the former Conservative government led by David Cameron. In 2015 his chancellor, George Osborne, declared, \u201cNo economy in the west is as open to Chinese investment as the U.K.\u201d\n\nEarlier that year the U.K. government became the first major imperialist power to sign up for Beijing\u2019s new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The Chinese rulers launched this international financial operation in 2016, seeking to establish a position as the primary lending choice for governments in Asia. Their goal is to buttress China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, tying regional governments more closely to Beijing and dealing blows to the rival U.S.-backed World Bank and International Monetary Fund.\n\nCameron\u2019s government also made deals for significant involvement by Chinese companies in nuclear power, finance, logistics and technology in the U.K.\n\nA sharp economic downturn has accelerated trade and currency conflicts since governments worldwide imposed broad shutdowns on production and travel in response to the outbreak of coronavirus. This is intensifying fault lines between London and its post-Brexit EU rivals, as well as between the rulers of the various EU states themselves. All these factors work to push the British rulers to turn even more decisively toward Washington.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "google-site-verification": "ez6niY69d5u9kIqSddel2o7bx_3vR86uqdVHhO1C9hA", "generator": "WPML ver:4.2.1 stt:1,4,2;", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i2.wp.com/themilitant.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cropped-MIlitant_favicon.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}}}
