This represents the culmination of a long process which began with an internationally led investigation,\u201d McEntee said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe Criminal Assets Bureau took part in this international operation which led to the freezing of over $1 billion in funds worldwide, of which approximately \u20ac5.5 million was identified in a Dublin based bank account.\n\n\u201cThe return of these assets will be the first time that Ireland has taken such action and will be a concrete demonstration of Ireland\u2019s commitment to international cooperation in the fight against corruption and to assisting countries which have been adversely affected by corruption in the past, and is in line with our international obligations as a signatory to the UN Convention Against Corruption.\u201d\n\nShe said the MoU to return the loot was achieved by significant multi-agency collaboration in Ireland, adding: \u201cIt demonstrates the intent of both States to uphold our shared values and our international obligations to eliminate corruption.\u201d\n\nTransparency International estimates Abacha might have looted as much as $5 billion during his regime from 1993 to 1998.\n\nAbout $3.6 billion has so far been recovered out of that money. The recoveries have, however, been marred by corruption.\n\nAn agency had reported how the federal government paid controversial legal fees of up to $15 million to lawyers Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation, hired for the repatriation of $321 million Abacha Loot from Switzerland.\n\nVanguard\n\nKindly Share This Story:\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM: General\n\nLoading...", "METADATA": {"Description": "Kindly Share This Story:Sani Abacha\nBy Victoria Ojeme\nThe Republic of Ireland has agreed to return about N2,514,651,800 (\u20ac5.5 million) stolen by the Nigerian former head of", "Keywords": "General,Breaking: Ireland returns \u20ac5.5m Abacha loot to Nigeria,Breaking:,Ireland,returns,\u20ac5.5m,Abacha,loot,to,Nigeria", "news_keywords": "General,Breaking: Ireland returns \u20ac5.5m Abacha loot to Nigeria,Breaking:,Ireland,returns,\u20ac5.5m,Abacha,loot,to,Nigeria", "robots": "ALL", "Googlebot": "index,follow,noarchive", "REVISIT-AFTER": "1 DAYS", "RATING": "GENERAL", "generation-time": "1s", "original-source": "https://news2.onlinenigeria.com/news/general/845696-breaking-ireland-returns-e5-5m-abacha-loot-to-nigeria.html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ZOOMIMAGE": "https://www.onlinenigeria.com/files/", "ZOOMWORDS": "Breaking: Ireland returns \u20ac5.5m Abacha loot to Nigeria,General,News, Politics, Entertainment,Celebrity News,Tech", "og": {"title": "Breaking: Ireland returns \u20ac5.5m Abacha loot to Nigeria", "type": "Website", "url": "https://news2.onlinenigeria.com/news/general/845696-breaking-ireland-returns-e5-5m-abacha-loot-to-nigeria.html", "site_name": "onlinenigeria", "description": "Kindly Share This Story:Sani Abacha\nBy Victoria Ojeme\nThe Republic of Ireland has agreed to return about N2,514,651,800 (\u20ac5.5 million) stolen by the Nigerian former head of", "image": {"identifier": "https://news2.onlinenigeria.com/files/", "width": 600, "height": 315}}, "article": {"published_time": "14/08/2020 13:20:00", "modified_time": "14/08/2020 13:20:00", "author": "https://www.onlinenigeria.com/author/Larry Nwabuoku", "tag": "Breaking: Ireland returns \u20ac5.5m Abacha loot to Nigeria,General,", "section": "General"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@onlinenigeria", "title": "Breaking: Ireland returns \u20ac5.5m Abacha loot to Nigeria", "description": "Kindly Share This Story:Sani Abacha\nBy Victoria Ojeme\nThe Republic of Ireland has agreed to return about N2,514,651,800 (\u20ac5.5 million) stolen by the Nigerian former head of", "image": "https://news2.onlinenigeria.com/files/"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
