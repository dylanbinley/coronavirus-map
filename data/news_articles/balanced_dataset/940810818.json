Archie Gamboa said Thursday night that Abu Sayyaf commander Anduljihad Susukan gave up after negotiations with police in southern Davao city, where he was served warrants for at least 23 cases of murder, six for attempted murder and five for kidnapping.\n\nHe is the highest-ranking commander of the small but brutal Abu Sayyaf group to be arrested so far this year. The military has been waging a years-long offensive against the Abu Sayyaf, which has been blacklisted by the United States and the Philippines as a terrorist organization for past bombings, ransom kidnappings and beheadings. Many of its gunmen, mostly peasants and desperately poor villagers, have aligned themselves with the Islamic State group.\n\nSecurity officials have blamed Susukan and his men for playing a role in cross-border kidnappings of tourists and other victims from the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo island, including a Malaysian citizen, who was beheaded by the militants in 2015 in their jungle base in southern Sulu province on the day when Malaysia\u2019s then-prime minister Najib Razak arrived in Manila to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.\n\nSusukan also helped finance the kidnappings in the south of two Canadian men, who were separately beheaded in Sulu in 2016 after the militants failed to get a huge ransom. Another Abu Sayyaf militant, Ben Yadah, murdered the two Canadians and remains at large, a military officer said.\n\nSusukan surrendered to a Muslim rebel chief after the accidental explosion of his M203 rifle grenade in a gun battle with troops in Sulu severed his left arm. Military officials had believed he was killed but later learned he was in the custody of Nur Misuari, who leads an armed group which signed a 1996 peace deal with the government.\n\nMisuari flew from Jolo to Davao city on a private plane with a few companions that included Susukan on Sunday, sparking speculation he may be planning to present the terror suspect to President Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nDuterte has been staying in his hometown in Davao city, where Misuari also has a home. Although the president has appointed Misuari as a special envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Muslim rebel chief has not been clearly authorized to hold talks with suspected terrorists.\n\n\u201cHis giving himself up to Mr. Misuari is not the surrender contemplated under the law and does not make him immune from arrest,\u201d military spokesman Maj. Gen. Edgard Arevalo said of Susukan in a statement.\n\nUnder a murky arrangement, Misuari and his rebel force have been allowed to keep their weapons in Sulu and outlying provinces under the 1996 Muslim autonomy deal in the south, homeland of minority Muslims in the largely Roman Catholic nation.\n\nThe militants beheaded the two Canadians after ransom deadlines lapsed. At the time, Prime Justin Trudeau urged governments not to pay ransom to discourage similar abductions.\n\nJohn Ridsdel of Calgary and fellow Canadian Robert Hall were among four tourists kidnapped in September 2015 by Abu Sayyaf militants along with Norwegian man Kjartan Sekkingstad and Marites Flor, a woman from the Philippines.\n\nThe two Canadians, Sekkingstad, who was a permanent resident of Canada at the time, and Flor, who was Hall\u2019s girlfriend, were snatched from a marina.\n\nFlor was freed in June 2016 and Sekkingstad was released a few months later in September.\n\nRidsdel was executed in April of that year and Hall was beheaded in June.\n\nGet more from the St. Catharines Standard in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the St. Catharines Standard.
