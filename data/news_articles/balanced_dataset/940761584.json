Picture: Royal British Legion Eric Adie. Picture: Royal British Legion\n\n\u201cHe said he was trying to track down Peter Ramm\u2019s existing family as he had his service tags which his own father, Eric, had kept for all these years.\u201d\n\nMr Adie, who lives in Suffolk, told Mr Green, his father, Eric Adie had trained with his uncle at Marbury Hall in Cheshire in 1940 and how both had served together in the Norfolk Regiment.\n\nMr Green said; \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe that Robert had tracked me down after all this time and that I was speaking to someone who had a connection to my uncle. I realised that I even had a photo of the 5th Battalion taken at Marbury Hall while they were receiving training before going abroad which shows Peter and Eric next to each other.\u201d\n\nAfter completing their training the pair expected to be posted to India, but were instead sent to Singapore.\n\nMarbury Hall 1941.
