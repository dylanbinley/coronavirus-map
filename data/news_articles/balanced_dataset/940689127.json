All these policy directives and programmes are also meant to address some of the causative factors of insecurity.\u201d\n\nIn a separate statement issued yesterday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, the president assured Nigerians that his government will spend more on infrastructure across the country.\n\nBuhari described the 17-storey building, known as the Nigerian Content Tower, as a reflection of his administration\u2019s drive to provide infrastructure nationwide to attract investments, create jobs and eradicate poverty.\n\nIn his remarks, Sylva said the completion of the project was a key achievement in the portfolio of priorities given to the ministry, adding that with the ongoing developments in the oil and gas sector, the narratives are being changed from obscurity to transparency and from despair to development.\n\n\u201cThe commissioning of this building is symbolic in many ways: It shows that Mr. President is keen to see infrastructural development in every part of the country; it shows that skyscrapers and other laudable infrastructure can be built in the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cIt shows that indigenous contractors can perform wonders when given the right opportunities; it shows that the people of Bayelsa and indeed the entire Niger Delta are receptive to development, and it shows that Nigerian content is here to stay,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described the 10MW gas-fired power plant in partnership with NAOC JV to service the new headquarters building and the NCDMB industrial park under construction as a landmark.\n\nSylva said: \u201cThis gas-fired power plant is just a tip of the iceberg as the ministry under the direction of Mr. President is set to unlock the opportunities in our gas resources instead of just quoting the statistics of our gas endowments every year.\n\n\u201cOur declaration of the Year 2020 as the Year of Gas is no fluke. Throughout the year 2020 and beyond, our focus on gas development will be significant: from export gas to domestic gas, from LPG to CNG to mini-LNG, from power to fertiliser.\n\n\u201cWe will devote our energy to unlock the gas below the ground and eliminate the wastage at the flares. I call on local and international investors to join us in these efforts for the benefit of all.\u201d\n\nThe Executive Secretary, NCDMB, Wabote, in his address, stated that about half of the surface of the building was buried below to keep it standing and provide structural foundation support, using 207 piles, each at 800 millimetre diameter, driven to 30 metres depth.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe put a lot of thought into the design of the building not only to bring out a magnificent edifice but we also focused on the subsequent usage covering the ergonomics, acoustics, security, safety, energy efficiency and maintenance.\n\n\u201cSome of the specifics include the use of fire-retardant fa\u00e7ade, intelligent building management system that cuts down power consumption by 25 per cent, the provision of an over-hanging cradle on the roof slab to clean the four sides of the building, zero voice transmission through the walls of the conference centre, scissors design in the ramp of the multi-level car park to avoid head-on collision, and many others too numerous to mention.\n\n\u201cThe materials used are 76 per cent Nigerian content with the tiles, electrical cables, granite, and many other building materials produced in Nigeria. The manpower used for services and labour is over 95 per cent Nigerian content. The skills transferred to the local workforce in the construction of a high-rise building have been unprecedented.\u201d\n\nNNPC boss, Kyari, described the completion of the building as a testimony to the fact that with the right mindset, anything can be delivered in the country.\n\nHe said skills had been deployed in building the edifice and pledged the corporation\u2019s support for the NCDMB and the Niger Delta people.\n\nBayelsa State Governor, Diri, who commended the president for not abandoning the project, urged him to pressure the oil companies to move their headquarters to the state where they do a large chunk of their business.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2020/07/250b862b-muhammadu-buhari.jpg", "secure_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2020/07/250b862b-muhammadu-buhari.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Buhari Inaugurates Tallest Building in South-south, South-east - THISDAYLIVE", "description": "\u2022Says expect more infrastructure, local content By Emmanuel Addeh President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday inaugurated the 17-storey Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) headquarters in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, reputed to be the tallest building in the South-south and South-east, assuring Nigerians that his administration will spend more on infrastructure and local content.
