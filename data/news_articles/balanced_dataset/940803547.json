But the current border rules, which allow for arriving flights from some countries, are both \u201cincredibly conflicting\u201d and lack legal certainty, a law office says.\n\nOutlier Legal, which specializes in immigration and residency, says it is challenging how Costa Rican authorities are handling arriving and returning residents.\n\n\u201cWe have sent a series of clarifications to Immigration and the Ministry of Health, challenging some decisions,\u201d wrote Irene Brenes in a post shared on their website. \u201cIncluding a request for an explanation as to why the principles of publicity, legal certainty and proper application of the law appeared to have been forgotten these past few days.\u201d\n\nAmong the most pressing clarifications is understanding whether Costa Rica residents can enter via a flight from anywhere, or just from one of the 44 countries authorized for tourism.\n\nOutlier Legal is also trying to confirm if exceptions still apply for the immediate family of citizens and why the Immigration Administration continues issuing re-entry bans to residents who leave Costa Rica.\n\n\u201cThese have been challenging and busy months,\u201d Brenes said.\n\nOne rule isn\u2019t uncertain: Anyone trying to enter Costa Rica on a tourist visa must present proof of a negative PCR-RT coronavirus test from a sample taken within 48 hours of the flight to Costa Rica.\n\nThat requirement became exceedingly clear to a group of Canadians who were held at Juan Santamar\u00eda International Airport after arriving on a charter flight before receiving their test results.\n\n\u201cSome Canadians had to wait for their entry to the country while they obtained the result of the COVID test, since they did not carry it,\u201d the Immigration Administration told The Tico Times in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt is important to mention that the COVID test is an essential requirement for entering Costa Rica.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "news_keywords": "airport, coronavirus, Costa Rica flights, Costa Rica residency, costa rican legal system, Immigration Administration, residency, SJO, travel ban, vacation,", "fb": {"admins": "ticotimes", "app_id": 151666745255528, "pages": 124823954224180}, "og": {"title": "Costa Rica entry rules \u2018incredibly conflicting,\u2019 law office says", "type": "\u00bb Costa Rica entry rules \u2018incredibly conflicting,\u2019 law office saysThe Tico Times | Costa Rica News | Travel | Real Estate", "url": "https://ticotimes.net/2020/08/14/costa-rica-entry-rules-incredibly-conflicting-law-office-says", "description": "Since Costa Rica declared a State of Emergency due to the coronavirus in mid-March, the country has continued adjusting measures, reopening parts of the economy with an\u2026", "site_name": "The Tico Times Costa Rica", "image": "https://ticotimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tourists-receive-welcome-gifts-at-SJO-Iberia-on-August-3-2020-999x685.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://ticotimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cropped-Logo-270x270.png"}}}
