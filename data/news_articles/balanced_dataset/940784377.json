Eight months have passed since Ghani issued the order, but so far none of the names of those involved in land-grabbing have been disclosed.\n\n\u201cThe legal and judicial institutions and also the government system in general have acted in a paralyzed way when it comes to addressing major cases of land-grabbing. The Afghan government despite its continued commitments has failed to achieve the least of achievements in this respect,\u201d said Naser Taimoori, a researcher at Integrity Watch Afghanistan (IWA).\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Urban Development, 15,830 people, which include local strongmen and influential people, have been accused of land-grabbing.\n\n\u201cA list containing 15,830 people who are accused of land-grabbing have been referred to the legal and judicial institutions so that they investigate their cases. Those involved in land-grabbing will be tackled in line with the law,\" said Hashmat Naseri, a spokesman for the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.\n\nStatistics by the Ministry of Urban Development indicate that 1.6 million acres of government land has been taken illegally so far and also 335 newly established townships have legal shortcomings.\n\n\u201cThe Office of the Attorney General of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan has probed all cases involving land-grabbing in line with the law,\u201d said Jamshid Rasuli, a spokesman for the Attorney General of Afghanistan.\n\nPresident Ghani had tasked the Kabul governor to identify those involved in land-grabbing.\n\n\u201cAll statistics have been collected and they have been shared with the appellate court of Kabul, the Kabul police headquarters and the Ministry of Interior,\u201d said Mohammad Yaqoub Haidari, the governor of Kabul.\n\nBased on the data of the Ministry of Urban Development, the total acres of land grabbed in Kabul is around 100,000 acres.\n\nKabul's governor said that 50,000 acres of land have been grabbed in Kabul\u2019s Deh Sabz, Chahar Asyab, Bagrami, Qarahbagh and Shakar Dara area by the local strong men.", "METADATA": {"title": "Almost 16,000 Land-Grabbing Suspects in 2 Years: Ministry | TOLOnews", "description": "The Afghan Ministry of Urban Development has said that over 15,830 suspects accused of having a role in land-grabbing have been referred to the legal and judicial institutions over the past", "referrer": "origin", "og": {"description": "IWA said that land-grabbing still continues at full tilt.", "image": "https://tolonews.com/sites/default/files/1_587.jpg", "site_name": "TOLOnews", "title": "Almost 16,000 Land-Grabbing Suspects in 2 Years: Ministry | TOLOnews", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Afghan Ministry of Urban Development has said that over 15,830 suspects accused of having a role in land-grabbing have been referred to the legal and judicial institutions over the past", "image": "https://tolonews.com/sites/default/files/1_587.jpg", "url": "https://tolonews.com/afghanistan/almost-16000%C2%A0land-grabbing-suspects-2-years-ministry", "site": "@TOLOnews", "title": "Almost 16,000 Land-Grabbing Suspects in 2 Years: Ministry", "card": "summary"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "fb": {"pages": 187202271320522}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
