Success looks like these tenants being moved into permanent housing elsewhere. Evicting them will mean they definitely end up on the street.\n\n\u201cThese tenants are usually only there for between 7-21 days so even if the behaviour is managed, a new crop will arrive soon after. So you can imagine the challenge the staff face.\u201d\n\nMultiple businesses approached by Stuff on Tuesday said the problem had been getting increasingly worse.\n\nMonique Ford/Stuff Eva Beva owner Greig Wilson has seen multiple physical assaults and an increase in gang activity at the park since he opened his bar four years ago.\n\nEva Beva owner Greig Wilson is no stranger to the ongoing problems in Te Aro Park.\n\nWhen his bar opened four years ago there was some drinking in the park, but he said there had been a \u201cnoticeable difference\u201d in the past 12 months of increased drinking, gang presence, and violence, including on his staff.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t believe it will be long until someone is stabbed or killed in the area.\n\n\u201cSooner or later, someone will die.\u201d\n\nWilson now had to consider whether it was worthwhile calling the police, as he saw four or five events each day that could be worthy of notifying police. .\n\n\u201cI have to think, how bad is it? Is someone getting beaten up? Or are they just drinking? Do I have 30 minutes free to sit on the phone to police? I have to self-categorise.\u201d\n\nRecently, he watched a woman in the park being dragged down the street by her hair and getting kicked in the head.\n\nWilson ran outside to help but froze, along with other bystanders attempting to intervene, put off by a man making threats to people, yelling \u201cBlack Power!\u201d and \u201cwe will kill you\u201d.\n\nMonique Ford/Stuff Swimsuit Coffee owner Tait Burge is saddened by the \"endless amount of drama\" at Te Aro Park, as he believes the area has a lot of potential.\n\nSwimsuit Coffee owner Tait Burge started his cafe around 17-months-ago and received a \u201cvery strong warning\u201d by previous owners that the anti-social and disorderly behaviour at the park \u201ccame with the job\u201d.\n\nHe had been required to trespass three people this year and said his staff members were intimidated on a weekly basis.\n\nHe called the issue \u201cthe elephant in the room of the city\u201d.\n\nOnce, he walked in on someone using meth in the public toilets.\n\nAn employee of Shosha, a vapourized store opposite the park, who wished to stay anonymous, said staff in the store \u201cfear for their lives\u201d and were often visited by people who drank in the park.\n\nROBERT KITCHIN/STUFF Wellington City councillor Fleur Fitzsimons is concerned about the increasing violence in Courtenay Place.\n\nThey described the behaviour they had seen as \u201csickening\u201d and said they have had to press the store\u2019s panic button about four or five times this year.\n\nRakesh Varnia, who owns City Stop, a 24-hour convenience store on Manners St, said he would like to see emergency social housing moved out of the city centre.\n\nHe said around $500-$600 worth of damage had been caused in his store in the past few months, by people under the influence of alcohol and drugs.\n\nCouncillor Nicola Young said the park was a \u201cmagnet for crime\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is the epicentre of all that is wrong late at night. Everything bad in Wellington happens there.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "noarchive", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "fb": {"app_id": 207633159308175, "pages": 21253884267}, "verify-v1": "RazNiYjuvNuEsMeFXxfR9l9cDZIKxcq2VjQZA25CHgM=", "msapplication-config": "/sics-assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "A small park in the central city has become a big problem for business, police and the public.", "source": "Stuff", "og": {"description": "A small park in the central city has become a big problem for business, police and the public.", "title": "Gang members in nearby emergency accommodation linked to anti-social issues in Wellington's 'Pigeon Park'", "url": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/wellington-top-stories/122410565/gang-members-in-nearby-emergency-accommodation-linked-to-antisocial-issues-in-wellingtons-pigeon-park", "type": "article", "image": "https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/4/y/n/r/3/b/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.20volh.png/1597295884803.jpg", "site_name": "Stuff"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T17:00:00.000Z"}, "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-title": "Gang members in nearby emergency accommodation linked to anti-social issues in Wellington's 'Pigeon Park'", "parsely-link": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/wellington-top-stories/122410565", "parsely-image-url": "https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/4/y/n/r/3/b/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.20volh.png/1597295884803.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-08-13T17:00:00.000Z", "parsely-author": "Sophie Cornish", "parsely-section": "dominion-post", "parsely-tags": "dominion-post,wellington-top-stories"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
