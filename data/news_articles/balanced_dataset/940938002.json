Russia sees Belarus as a strategic buffer against NATO and the EU.\n\nStatements by both sides contained a pointed reference to a \u201cunion state\u201d between the two countries. Lukashenko has previously rejected calls by Moscow for closer economic and political ties as an assault on his country\u2019s sovereignty.\n\n\u201cBoth sides expressed confidence that all the problems that have arisen will be resolved soon,\u201d a Kremlin statement said after Lukashenko and Putin spoke by phone.\n\n\u201cThese problems should not be exploited by destructive forces seeking to harm the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries within the framework of the union state,\u201d it added.\n\nThe European Union is gearing up to impose new sanctions on Belarus in response to a violent crackdown in which at least two protesters have been killed and thousands detained.\n\nOn a visit to neighbouring Poland, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington was monitoring the situation closely. The leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania called on Belarus to conduct new \u201cfree and fair\u201d elections.\n\nLukashenko said he did not need foreign governments or mediators to solve the situation in Belarus, state news agency Belta reported.\n\n\u201cWe will not give the country away to anyone,\u201d he said.\n\nTens of thousands took to the streets of the Belarusian capital on Saturday. Crowds gathered to lay flowers where one of the protesters was killed this week, waving flags and chanting \u201cgo away\u201d and \u201cLukashenko is a murderer\u201d.\n\n\u2018OUTSIDE MEDDLING\u2019\n\nLukashenko has accused the protesters of being criminals and in cahoots with foreign backers. Ahead of his call with Putin on Saturday, he suggested that the impact of the protests might spill beyond Belarus\u2019s borders.\n\nMoscow this week also accused unnamed countries of \u201coutside meddling\u201d in Belarus.\n\n\u201cThere is a need to contact Putin so that I can talk to him now, because it is not a threat to just Belarus anymore,\u201d Lukashenko said, according to the Belta news agency.\n\n\u201cDefending Belarus today is no less than defending our entire space, the union state ... Those who roam the streets, most of them do not understand this.\u201d\n\nOpposition presidential candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled to neighbouring Lithuania on Tuesday, has called for more protests and an election recount.\n\nHer campaign announced she was starting to form a national council to facilitate the transfer of power.\n\nLukashenko on Friday warned Belarusians to stay at home to avoid becoming \u201ccannon fodder\u201d.\n\nRussia has been wary of unrest on its borders since governments fell in Georgia\u2019s 2003 Rose Revolution, Ukraine\u2019s 2003-04 Orange Revolution and Kyiv\u2019s 2014 Maidan protests - events in which it says the West backed the protesters.\n\nA participant embraces a member of Belarusian Interior Ministry troops, who stands guard during an opposition demonstration to protest against police violence and to reject the presidential election results near the Government House in Independence Square in Minsk, Belarus August 14, 2020. REUTERS/Vasily Fedosenko\n\nLukashenko, a 65-year-old who once ran a Soviet collective farm, has faced increasing anger over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as a sluggish economy and civil rights.\n\nThe official election result handed him a landslide victory with 80% of the vote, compared to around 10% for Tsikhanouskaya. Washington said the vote \u201cwas not free and fair\u201d.\n\n\u201cFormer president of #Belarus now asks Putin for help. Against whom?
