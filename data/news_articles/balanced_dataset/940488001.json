The Iranians have held the country hostage at gunpoint. Macron has done the right thing in calling them out.\"\n\nAl-Shehri said the resignation of Prime Minister Hassan Diab and his government was the first step in freeing Lebanon from the clutches of both Iran and Hezbollah. \u201cBut this is by no means enough. If this government is replaced by another which is at the mercy of Hezbollah, then it will be back to square one.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is important for France and other world powers to ensure that Hezbollah is disarmed and that it hands over its weapons to the Lebanese army; only then will there be stability.\n\nAs long as there is a state within a state, nobody from the global community will come forward to rescue Lebanon from the difficulties it finds itself in.\"\n\nAl-Shehri said Macron had correctly understood the problem and had done the right thing in warning Iran. \u201cNow he should take this to its logical conclusion and end the nightmare for Lebanon, the Lebanese people, and the region,\" he said. \u201cFrance will find many takers in the international and regional communities in its efforts to clean up the mess in Lebanon.\u201d\n\nFrench senator Natalie Goulet told Arab News that France and the EU were \u201cplaying with fire\u201d over Hezbollah.\n\n\u201cAs the only Lebanese party that has never disarmed, its paramilitary and its international network make it a force more powerful than the Lebanese army,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not without reason that many countries, including the US, classify this movement as a terrorist organization.\n\n\u201cBut the EU and France make a totally artificial distinction between the paramilitary branch, which is associated with terrorism, and the political branch, which is not.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me to be utopian to think that Iran would withdraw support from its proxy.\n\n\u201cAnd there is a serious risk that Hezbollah will use international financial help for Lebanon to follow its agenda,which is fixed by Tehran. We must not be be blind or na\u00efve.\u201d\n\nThis article has been adapted from its original source.", "METADATA": {"title": "Macron Warns Iran to Stay Out of Lebanon | Al Bawaba", "og": {"site_name": "Al Bawaba", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.albawaba.com/news/macron-warns-iran-stay-out-lebanon-1374241", "title": "Macron Warns Iran to Stay Out of Lebanon | Al Bawaba", "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron warned Iran on Wednesday to stay out of Lebanon as it rebuilds after last week\u2019s devastating blast.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/default/public/2020-08/000_1VH13C_0.jpg?itok=idRXOJzR", "url": "https://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/default/public/2020-08/000_1VH13C_0.jpg?itok=idRXOJzR", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron warned Iran on Wednesday to stay out of Lebanon as it rebuilds after last week\u2019s devastating blast.", "title": "Macron Warns Iran to Stay Out of Lebanon | Al Bawaba", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/default/public/2020-08/000_1VH13C_0.jpg?itok=idRXOJzR", "height": 630, "width": 1200}}, "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron warned Iran on Wednesday to stay out of Lebanon as it rebuilds after last week\u2019s devastating blast.", "abstract": "French President Emmanuel Macron warned Iran on Wednesday to stay out of Lebanon as it rebuilds after last week\u2019s devastating blast.", "keywords": "Macron, Lebanon, Blast", "referrer": "origin", "rights": "\u00a92020 Al Bawaba.
