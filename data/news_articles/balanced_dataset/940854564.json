The United Nations said it hopes the agreement \u201cwill create an opportunity for Israeli and Palestinian leaders to re-engage in meaningful negotiations.\u201d\n\nPalestinian leaders reacted with almost unanimous fury.\n\n\u201cWe vehemently denounce and refuse this agreement,\u201d reads a statement posted on Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas\u2019s Facebook page. The statement calls the move \u201ca betrayal\u201d by the UAE and accuses Israel of lying in order to eventually snap up more Palestinian lands.\n\nThe agreement says Israel promises to stop the annexation for now, but not forever, said Giorgio Cafiero, the CEO of Washington-based Gulf State Analytics.\n\n\u201cWhile we can talk about all the benefits this brings the UAE, Israel and Donald Trump,\u201d said Cafiero. \u201cIt is clear that the Palestinians are the losers here.\u201d\n\nBahraini officials load medical aid and ground-support equipment into a plane as they head to Beirut to provide support following Tuesday's blast, at Isa Air Base in Ras Al Bur, Bahrain, Aug. 7, 2020.\n\nFollowing UAE\u2019s lead\n\nBahrain in the Persian Gulf and Sudan in North Africa appear to be the most interested in establishing diplomatic ties with Israel next, according to Cafiero. Or at least they have the most to gain, and the least to lose, he said.\n\n\u201cIt could help Bahrain establish a more formal partnership with a powerful country in the Middle East that shares its perception as Iran as a major threat,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to Sudan, the current government has signaled its keenness to engage Israel.\u201d\n\nSudan may be reluctant to say it can work with Israel out loud, as the Jewish state is deeply unpopular in Muslim countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Analysts say Sudan is also straining under the weight of Western sanctions, and normalizing relations with Israel might bring some relief.\n\nOther analysts have speculated that Saudi Arabia could also benefit from establishing ties with Israel, but the kingdom has remained relatively quiet.\n\nCurrently, Egypt and Jordan are the only two countries that have normal relations with Israel. For decades, the other Arab countries have agreed not to do so, hoping to pressure Israel into returning some land to Palestinians.\n\nBreaking this long-standing agreement may help Palestinians in the short term by delaying the annexation, but it may also permanently reduce the Arab world\u2019s ability to influence Israel on this issue, said Kassem in Egypt.\n\n\u201cIf this trend continues of piecemeal settlements without addressing the main issue\u2014the Palestinian/Israeli conflict,\u201d he said, \u201cthe problem will never really go away.\u201d\n\nFILE - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi delivers an address at the Ittihadiya presidential palace in Cairo, Egypt, May 26, 2017.\n\nDeepening divisions\n\nAcross the Middle East, other leaders have put out statements either for or against the deal, often taking sides against their established foes.\n\nFor example, Egyptian President Abdul-Fattah el-Sissi tweeted that the new relationship was \u201ctaking steps to bringing peace in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, at odds with both Egypt and the UAE, reacted by threatening to end Ankara\u2019s diplomatic relationship with the UAE.\n\n\u201cI think this development can serve to exacerbate polarization in the already deeply divided region,\u201d said Cafiero.", "METADATA": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@VOANews", "description": "After Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed to normalize diplomatic relations, some regional leaders applauded the move and others condemned it.\n\nAnd some countries appeared to be interested in following suit.\n\nThe agreement could be the beginning of a new trend that may eventually lead to normal relations between Israel and much of the Middle East, according to Hisham\u202fKassem,\u202fa veteran Egyptian publisher and analyst.\n\n\u201cThere will be other countries to follow,\u201d he said.", "title": "Analysts: More Countries to Follow Suit After Israel/UAE Agreement", "url": "https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/analysts-more-countries-follow-suit-after-israeluae-agreement", "image": "https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/710x340/s3/2020-08/2020-08-14T112128Z_386786357_RC2NDI9RD8JO_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-EMIRATES-PALESTINIANS-PROTESTS.JPG?itok=BRlZl2DZ"}, "og": {"site_name": "Voice of America", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/analysts-more-countries-follow-suit-after-israeluae-agreement", "title": "Analysts: More Countries to Follow Suit After Israel/UAE Agreement", "description": "After Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed to normalize diplomatic relations, some regional leaders applauded the move and others condemned it.\n\nAnd some countries appeared to be interested in following suit.\n\nThe agreement could be the beginning of a new trend that may eventually lead to normal relations between Israel and much of the Middle East, according to Hisham\u202fKassem,\u202fa veteran Egyptian publisher and analyst.\n\n\u201cThere will be other countries to follow,\u201d he said.", "image": {"identifier": "https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2020-08/2020-08-14T112128Z_386786357_RC2NDI9RD8JO_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-EMIRATES-PALESTINIANS-PROTESTS.JPG", "width": 6282, "height": 4136}}, "fb": {"pages": 36235438073, "app_id": 394734098058258}, "description": "After Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed to normalize diplomatic relations, some regional leaders applauded the move and others condemned it.\n\nAnd some countries appeared to be interested in following suit.\n\nThe agreement could be the beginning of a new trend that may eventually lead to normal relations between Israel and much of the Middle East, according to Hisham\u202fKassem,\u202fa veteran Egyptian publisher and analyst.\n\n\u201cThere will be other countries to follow,\u201d he said.", "msvalidate.01": "3286EE554B6F672A6F2E608C02343C0E", "article": {"section": "Middle East"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1414561730, app-argument=//4948560.ltr", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#3a79b7"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
