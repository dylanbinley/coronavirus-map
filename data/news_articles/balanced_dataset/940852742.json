Inside the boot there was a bag which he opened, and there was a bundle of cash in it, in R200 notes,\" said the witness who gave evidence off-site.\n\nIn a statement released on Friday, Gigaba hit back, saying he intended to cross-examine the witness.\n\n\"Yesterday, evidence was led at the state capture commission of inquiry by three unidentified witnesses. Witness 3 made allegations in which he seeks to implicate me in some wrongdoing.\n\n\"Witness 3 made spurious allegations against me. I strongly deny any suggestion or insinuation that there is anything unlawful that I did. I am in the process of preparing an affidavit in response to the allegations of Witness 3 and have also instructed my legal representatives to simultaneously apply to the chairperson of the commission for leave to cross-examine Witness 3.\"\n\nGigaba added it was \"undesirable to engage the merits of the allegations\" in matters still before the commission, and would therefore limit his statement to that, and not take any questions.\n\n- Compiled by Paul Herman", "METADATA": {"mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "News24", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "default", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "red", "msapplication-TileColor": "red", "msapplication-TileImage": "~/images/pwa/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-config": "browserconfig.xml", "application-name": "News24", "msapplication-tooltip": "News24.
