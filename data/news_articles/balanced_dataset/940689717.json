It comes after a declassified document was released on Sunday which claims the FBI had lied to the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2018 about the reliability of the \u2018Steele dossier\u2019.\n\nTrending\n\nThe Steele dossier contained information from a Russian \u201csub-source\u201d about the investigation. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham released the declassified document alleging misdirection by the FBI, and said it showed the FBI had lied about the reliability of both the dossier and the sub-source within it. In a Fox News interview yesterday, the president was asked by reporter Maria Bartiromo whether Mr Wray should \u201cstep down\u201d. She said: \u201cWe know that the FBI lied to the Senate in February of 2018. Christopher Wray was running the FBI. Mr. President, is Christopher Wray hiding all of this stuff and protecting the FBI?\u201d\n\nDonald Trump has previously called the FBI 'badly broken'\n\nMr Trump replied: \u201cSo Christopher Wray was put there. We have an election coming up. I wish he was more forthcoming; he certainly hasn't been. \u201cThere are documents that they want to get, and we have said we want to get. We're going to find out if he's going to give those documents. But certainly, he's been very, very protective.\u201d Mr Trump suggested he would wait and see regarding the actions of the FBI director. He added: \u201cLet's see how Wray turns out. He's either going to turn out one way or the other.\u201d It is not the first time the president has slammed the FBI director for the Russia report proceedings.

Mr Trump said the funding would be used to help the post office handle the \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of mail-in ballots in the upcoming November presidential elections. The president has been sharply opposed to mail-in voting, repeatedly slamming it as a fraudulent method of voting.\n\nMr Trump recently refused extra funding for the US Postal Service due to his concerns over mail-in voting", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "DONALD Trump has lashed out at his own FBI director Christopher Wray.", "fb": {"pages": 129617873765147, "app_id": 823607694325129}, "og": {"title": "Donald Trump BLASTS his own FBI director Christopher Wray over Russia report", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1322678/Donald-Trump-news-russia-report-fbi-US-christopher-wray", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/750x445/1322678.jpg", "site_name": "Express.co.uk", "language": "en", "tags": "ctp_video,autoplay_video,Donald trump,donald trump news,donald trump russia,russia report,christopher wray,trump christopher wray,fbi", "section": "World", "description": "DONALD Trump has lashed out at his own FBI director Christopher Wray."}, "news_keywords": "ctp_video,autoplay_video,Donald trump,donald trump news,donald trump russia,russia report,christopher wray,trump christopher wray,fbi", "article": {"tag": "fbi", "published_time": "2020-08-14T04:59:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T05:01:39+01:00", "expiration_time": "2020-09-13", "section": "World", "image_count": 5, "video_count": 1, "word_count": 797, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 0}, "author": "Edward Browne", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"src": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/750x445/1322678.jpg"}, "title": "Donald Trump BLASTS his own FBI director Christopher Wray over Russia report", "description": "DONALD Trump has lashed out at his own FBI director Christopher Wray."}, "video_autoplay": "false", "headline_short": "Donald Trump BLASTS his own FBI director Christopher Wray over Russia report", "verify-v1": "EGl3XPBuem43awGwLC1rXGpRHRnmNSwp7VZfnCAAcKE=", "msvalidate.01": "1960193A20395DAD3FCB640BCB0D91D7", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "noodp,noydir,all"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
