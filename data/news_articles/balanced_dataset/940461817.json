That`s what I shared with foreign minister Lavrov,\" Pompeo said in the interview, conducted during his official visit to the Czech Republic.\n\n\"I know our military has talked to their senior leaders as well. We won`t brook that, we won`t tolerate,\" Pompeo said.\n\nLast month, US and European sources familiar with intelligence reporting said that the United States had acquired fresh reporting backing up the allegations that Russia had encouraged Taliban-affiliated militants to kill US and allied soldiers in Afghanistan.\n\nThe intelligence reporting comes as the United States has been engaged in negotiating with the Taliban as well as the Afghan government to get a stalled peace agreement, struck in February for the withdrawal of US troops, moving.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "verify-v1": "90soTS2GMMKllaVY8vtJNQKzGSgcoEhkVtoFlmAwpOw=", "news_keywords": "Mike Pompeo,Sergei Lavrov,Afghanistan", "description": "US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday said he warned his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov that there would be \"an enormous price to pay\" if Moscow is offering bounties to kill US soldiers or other Western troops in Afghanistan.", "keywords": "Mike Pompeo, Sergei Lavrov, Afghanistan", "fb": {"app_id": 1911135012435337}, "og": {"site_name": "Zee News", "type": "article", "title": "Mike Pompeo says he warned Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov against offering bounties for US soldiers", "url": "https://zeenews.india.com/world/mike-pompeo-says-he-warned-russian-foreign-minister-sergei-lavrov-against-offering-bounties-for-us-soldiers-2302393.html", "description": "US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday said he warned his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov that there would be \"an enormous price to pay\" if Moscow is offering bounties to kill US soldiers or other Western troops in Afghanistan.", "updated_time": "2020-08-13T08:23:34+05:30", "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2020/08/13/878736-mike1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@zeenews", "creator": "@zeenews", "url": "https://zeenews.india.com/world/mike-pompeo-says-he-warned-russian-foreign-minister-sergei-lavrov-against-offering-bounties-for-us-soldiers-2302393.html", "title": "Mike Pompeo says he warned Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov against offering bounties for US soldiers", "description": "US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday said he warned his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov that there would be \"an enormous price to pay\" if Moscow is offering bounties to kill US soldiers or other Western troops in Afghanistan.", "image": {"src": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2020/08/13/878736-mike1.jpg"}}, "article": {"tag": "Afghanistan", "published_time": "2020-08-13T08:23:34+05:30", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T08:23:34+05:30"}, "theme-color": "#2196f3"}}}
