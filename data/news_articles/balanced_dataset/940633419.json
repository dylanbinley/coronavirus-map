The sample for the frozen chicken wings imported from Brazil was taken from the surface of the batch in the Longgang district of Shenzhen, China and it tested positive. As per the official statement from the authorities, the sample was taken for testing on Wednesday.\n\nEvery time a batch of food imported is found to be contaminated with the novel coronavirus, it renews widespread concerns related to the possible risk of transmission from contaminated food.\n\nThe health authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have said before that the risk of coronavirus transmission through food is low.\n\nThe authorities have tested people who came into contact with the contaminated batch of frozen chicken wings. All have tested negative. Additionally, all of the frozen products in stock were sealed off and tested as well and they turned out to be negative as well.\n\nThe disinfection of the area where the product was stored is complete. The authorities did not name the brand but said that they are working on tracing related products from the same brand that has already been sold further.\n\nJust before the news of batch of frozen chicken wings imported from Brazil testing positive, a batch of shrimps imported from Ecuador was also found to be contaminated. This was discovered during a routine inspection of products at a restaurant in eastern Anhui province.\n\nBrazil is just after the U.S. in the global tally of countries with the maximum number of coronavirus cases. It has so far reported more than 3.1 million cases of COVID-19.\n\nPixabay", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "food contamination, food transmission covid19, coronavirus contamination food, china coronavirus, brazil coronavirus,", "fb": {"app_id": 229373533940657, "pages": 492371650790156}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Latin Times", "url": "https://www.latintimes.com/brazilian-chicken-wings-test-positive-coronavirus-china-460833", "title": "Brazilian Chicken Wings Test Positive For Coronavirus In China", "description": "A sample of chicken wings imported from Brazil has tested positive for coronavirus, the authorities in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen confirmed on Thursday, August 14.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/2020/01/21/china.png", "secure_url": "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/2020/01/21/china.png", "height": 637, "width": 966, "type": "image/png"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thelatintimes", "section": "News", "author": "Guneet Bhatia", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T14:45:45-04:00", "published_time": "2020-08-13T14:45:45-04:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thelatintimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Brazilian Chicken Wings Test Positive For Coronavirus In China", "url": "https://www.latintimes.com/brazilian-chicken-wings-test-positive-coronavirus-china-460833", "description": "A sample of chicken wings imported from Brazil has tested positive for coronavirus, the authorities in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen confirmed on Thursday, August 14.", "image": "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/styles/large/public/2020/01/21/china.png"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#17323f", "msapplication-config": "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/themes/lt/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#17323f", "author": "Guneet Bhatia", "keywords": "food contamination, food transmission covid19, coronavirus contamination food, china coronavirus, brazil coronavirus,", "description": "A sample of chicken wings imported from Brazil has tested positive for coronavirus, the authorities in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen confirmed on Thursday, August 14."}}}
