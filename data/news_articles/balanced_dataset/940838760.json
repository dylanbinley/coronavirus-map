For more than three decades, he had conducted ambitious research projects on enormous ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland.\n\nThe Swiss-born and, as the Washington Post\u2019s Matt Schudel described him, \u201ccharismatic\u201d Steffen had led students on annual research trips to Greenland, often doing so during his tenure with the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Studies, or CIRES, at the University of Colorado in Boulder. At the time of his death he was a professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.\n\nA respected climate change educator and communicator, he was also effective in speaking with policymakers and the general public on issues on which his expertise was unquestioned. He earned respect from other top climatologists and glaciologists.\n\n\u201cKoni\u2019s passing is very unfortunate and a great loss to the global glaciological community,\u201d said Ohio State University\u2019s Lonnie Thompson. \u201cKoni was deeply passionate about glaciers and ice sheets, especially Greenland, and the critical roles they play in Earth\u2019s climate system. If Koni had to choose where to depart this life, Greenland would have been at the top of his list.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuge loss. He was a towering figure in our field. Hard to tell even where to begin,\u201d said Richard Alley of Penn State. \u201cHis leadership portfolio was spectacular.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was an outstanding advisor to students, with a remarkable group of advisees carrying on the work (Waleed Abdalati, Atsu Muto, Julienne Stroeve, Jason Box \u2026). He served at multiple levels, internationally (IPCC, etc.), nationally, professionally, at the university level, and more.\u201d\n\nSteffen \u201cwas a gifted communicator and provided extensive information to policymakers and the general public,\u201d Alley continued. \u201cHis research was world-leading. \u2026 He enabled an amazing range of important research by others.\u201d\n\nExperts\u2019 perspectives: Glaciers past, present, and future\n\nSteffen was \u201cespecially dedicated to learning what is happening to ice, especially in Greenland, but also elsewhere including other parts of the Arctic, Canadian Arctic islands, China, and more. He wanted to get it right, providing truly accurate, reliable data and interpretations,\u201d Alley said. \u201cAnd, once he knew, for sure, what was happening, he made that information useful and actionable for policymakers, the general public, and other professionals.\u201d", "METADATA": {"p": {"domain_verify": "4e567f7a858593280b0602ca96b7a208"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#384047", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/themes/ycc2020/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "Steffen's passing is 'a great loss to the global glaciological community,' said Ohio State University's Lonnie Thompson.", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Scientists remember 'Koni' Steffen, glaciologist who died after fall into crevasse in Greenland \u00bb Yale Climate Connections", "description": "Steffen's passing is 'a great loss to the global glaciological community,' said Ohio State University's Lonnie Thompson.", "url": "https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/08/scientists-remember-konrad-koni-steffen-glaciologist/", "site_name": "Yale Climate Connections", "image": "https://yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0820_Konrad_Steffen_974.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/YaleClimateConnections", "published_time": "2020-08-14T20:15:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@bud_ward", "site": "@CC_Yale"}}}}
