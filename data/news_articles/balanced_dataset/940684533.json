Health Minister Adrian Dix\u2019s office in East Vancouver Thursday afternoon to protest the school restart plan.\n\nDespite the minister\u2019s office being closed, about a dozen people participated in the demonstration.\n\n\u201cWe would like to have our voices heard,\u201d said Stacey Wakelin, a rally organizer with Safe September BC.\n\nWakelin says there appears to be two sets of rules: one for schools and one for everywhere else.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been told as families, as parents to keep those bubbles tight, to isolate, to not socialize with a bunch of people, and now that our kids are going back to school. My kids are in high school and their cohort will be 120 -- it just doesn\u2019t match what we\u2019ve been told for all these months,\u201d she says.\n\nThe group is asking the province to delay the start date by at least two weeks, make masks mandatory, reduce class sizes and utilize community facilities as temporary classrooms.\n\nThe province is postponing the start of the school, but not to the extent parents are asking for.\n\nStudents won\u2019t head back to class for orientation until Sept. 10, a delay of two days.\n\nSafe September BC is encouraging parents to write to their local MLAs and school districts to share their concerns.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "A group of concerned parents and teachers marched to B.C.
