Since then, officials have identified a total of 29 cases, all linked to the same cluster.\n\n\u201cAs we have said from the start, our overall Covid-19 strategy remains elimination,\u201d Ardern said in a televised media conference. \u201cTogether, we have got rid of Covid before. We have kept it out for 102 days, longer than any other country. We can do all of that again.\u201d\n\nArdern is under pressure ahead of a upcoming general election, with the main opposition National Party accusing the government of failing to secure quarantine facilities and withholding information.\n\nArdern said contact tracing and genomic testing had found no links with the current outbreak to the country\u2019s border entry points or managed quarantine facilities. She said genome sequencing disproved the theory from some health experts that the virus could have been quietly moving through community since the original outbreak.\n\n\u201cThis suggests this is not a case of the virus being dormant or of a burning ember in our community,\u201d she said. \u201cIt appears to be new to New Zealand.\u201d\n\nHealth Minister Chris Hipkins said earlier that genome testing suggested the new virus outbreak had originated in Britain or Australia.\n\nFILE PHOTO: New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern speaks during a joint press conference held with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison at Admiralty House in Sydney, Australia, February 28, 2020. REUTERS/Loren Elliott/File Photo\n\nArdern cautioned that more cases were likely in the coming days but said she was confident officials would successfully identify the \u201cperimeter\u201d of the cluster - if not its source - allowing them to isolate cases and remove restrictions.\n\nThe earliest case authorities have identified to date is a worker at an Auckland-based cool store owned U.S.-based Americold Realty Trust, who became ill around July 31. Almost a dozen other infections have been directly linked to the facility.\n\nThe current Level 3 restrictions in Auckland requiring people to mostly remain at home, and level 2 restrictions for the rest of the country, are not as severe as the five-week level 4 shutdown she imposed earlier in the year.\n\n\u201cI would characterise our approach as a \u2018short but precautionary hold\u2019 in an ongoing investigation that will stamp out the virus,\u201d she said of the current measures, which will last a total of 14 days, the known incubation period for the virus.\n\nECONOMY WORRIES\n\nThe opposition National Party has been pressuring Ardern to delay the Sept. 19 election, arguing their inability to campaign because of restrictions gave her government an unfair advantage. Ardern said on Friday she would make a decision in the next 48 hours.\n\nNew Zealanders celebrated when Ardern appeared to eliminate community transmission of the coronavirus with the earlier hard lockdown that forced almost everyone to stay at home.\n\nThere were concerns a repeat of that process would come with a huge economic cost and Ardern on Friday announced the extension of a wage subsidy scheme and mortgage deferral program to support businesses and protect jobs.\n\n\u201cLifting restrictions now and seeing a potential explosion in cases is the worst thing we could do for Auckland and the New Zealand economy,\u201d she said.\n\nShoppers are seen at a mall in Wellington, New Zealand July 16, 2020.
