It\u2019s chaos. They\u2019re making it up as they go along now.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t justify this. It\u2019s guess work. I\u2019m not bothered about quarantine if I\u2019m too late. I\u2019ve just come through France on a road trip. I\u2019m trying to book to get home.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have to put me in prison before I comply with quarantine.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is ridiculous. It\u2019s still not enough time. I\u2019m really trying to get a ferry booked. It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d\n\nAre you stranded in France?

I think it is so stupid.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing whatsoever stopping anyone visiting their friends and family when they have been travelling.\u201d\n\nThe Sun can reveal concerned medics intervened to warn the PM that France\u2019s numbers were starting to spiral out of control.\n\nFrance recorded 2,669 new Covid-19 cases yesterday \u2014 a record outside of lockdown - and the infection rate over 14 days rose to 32.1 per 100,000.\n\n6 Passengers wait at Gare du Nord in Paris to get back home Credit: AP:Associated Press\n\nBrits caught short as they scramble home: British tourists in France are being charged hundreds of pounds to return home before quarantine restrictions are imposed. British Airways hiked fares up to nine times for passengers returning from the south of France. The final seats on its afternoon and evening flights from Nice to London were costing \u20ac727 and \u20ac854 \u2013 compared to E102 for passengers flying next Monday, a kayak.co.uk search showed. DFDS Seaways doubled fares for ferry passengers sailing from Calais to Dover yesterday, with two passengers and one car costing \u00a3196, compared to the \u00a3109 next week, a directferries.com search showed. P&O ferries had availability last evening - but prices were at least \u00a3200 a car, rather than \u00a390 on normal days. The lowest priced Eurostar tickets available this morning were \u00a3210. Travellers willing to pay these inflated fares could still miss out due to many services already being fully booked\n\nMost read in Politics DEADLY TOLL Coronavirus daily death toll falls to 3 as cases rises by 1,012 in 24 hours FERRY BAD NEWS Quarantined Brits furious after missing last boats & trains from France VIRUS HOTSPOTS The 29 towns & cities on PHE's virus watch list at risk of local lockdown TIME TO UNLOAD Flytipping victim uses dumper truck to return over 400 tyres to 'culprit' TEEN 'RAMPAGE' Girl, 17, arrested on attempted murder charge after driving car at 2 teens FINAL JOURNEY Hundreds of travellers line streets for funeral of 'King of Sheffield'\n\nThe PM risks a row with France\u2019s president Emmanuel Macron, who was on holiday yesterday in the South of France.\n\nFrance's secretary of state for European affairs said the UK decision would lead to \"reciprocal measures\" across the Channel.\n\nClement Beaune tweeted: \"A British decision which we regret and which will lead to reciprocal measures, all in hoping for a return for normal as soon as possible.\"", "METADATA": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, width=device-width, viewport-fit=cover", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373954290, affiliate-data=ct=Smart%20App%20Banner&pt=263124", "google-site-verification": "a576LGe3E0YA5QjAMY268jcuKWwPLIORxwlTMrjnfnE", "msvalidate.01": "E4359034FA254151A3AB2EFAC6D20D80", "p": {"domain_verify": "c061a8052bd9e93315b7f01447fa4124"}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Nicola Sturgeon 'sparked mad-dash panic by insisting France quarantine cut-off should be 24 hours EARLIER'", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/12402947/nicola-sturgeon-france-mad-dash/", "description": "NICOLA Sturgeon sparked a mad dash last night for Brits to get home after she forced the France quarantine cut-off to be 24 hours EARLIER.
