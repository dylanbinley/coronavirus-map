Loretta Sanchez, in an interview with Univision 19 that aired this weekend, suggested that President Barack Obama\u2019s endorsement of U.S. Senate rival Kamala Harris was in part based on race. Sanchez was asked why the president had endorsed Harris in the unusual race between two Democrats this year. Speaking in Spanish, she noted that Obama and Harris are longtime friends, then added: \u201cShe is African American. He is, too.\u201d Sanchez, in a statement after the interview aired, said she \u201cin no way\u201d implied or intended to imply Obama endorsed Harris for racial reasons. \u201cI was stating the fact that the endorsement was based on their long-term political relationship,\u201d she said. [More]\n\nA couple things struck me about this. First, the hypocrisy of Loretta Sanchez complaining about an opponent using race to get ahead. Sanchez got her US House seat by ousting B-1 Bob Dornan because his constituency had shifted underneath him through immigration to make a dependably Republican district turn Democrat. She used that to the hilt, saying that Dornan and his white constituency were old news and it was time for a wise Latina like her to take the reins.\n\nSecond, as Steve Sailer has observed, as we shift into a vibrant multi-culti utopia, it becomes less relevant what issues and political philosophies a candidate represents, but more relevant which tribe he (or in this case she) represents. Singapore President Lew Kuan Yew put it this way:\n\n\u201cIn multiracial societies, you don\u2019t vote in accordance with your economic interests and social interests, you vote in accordance with race and religion.\u201d\n\nThis is why Sanchez took to Univision (as opposed to a more broad-spectrum outlet) to complain about Obama's endorsement of her opponent. She wants to gin up a racial conflict with herself as the beneficiary. It is often said that California is a harbinger of larger trends in US society.\n\nWell, buckle up.\n\nRyan Kennedy has written us many letters and articles.
