He was found in one of the Covid-19 shelters in Durban, his father Francois Rabe said yesterday, adding that he had not seen him due to lockdown regulations. \u201cHe arrived back in Pretoria in May and was placed in a high-security ward,\u201d the father said. Without a Trace Foundation - which assists in looking for missing people - managed to trace him and immediately contacted the father. Rabe said the police were initially reluctant to fetch his son, but eventually took him back to the hospital.\n\n\u201cI have spoken with him over the phone; he doesn\u2019t care about what happened he just carries on with his life as normal.\n\n\u201cHe told me that the only thing he learnt from this is that he can now stop smoking because he spent such a long time without smoking since the lockdown.\u201d\n\nHe said his son initially ran away because of the smoking ban, escaping through a window late at night.\n\nHe said Jason told him that he had taken a bus to Durban.\n\n\u201cWe were in contact with the shelter every day to find out how he was. They told us he was becoming a little edgy and wanted to get out of there.\u201d\n\nThis was not the first time Jason had run away, to be found in Durban, as he always had an obsession with that city.\n\nHis father said when he was 16 he did the same thing but was found a month later.\n\nRabe was emotional yesterday as he explained how the police sent him a video of his son on the day they fetched him, in which he was fighting them. It took about 15 minutes to get him into the car.\n\n*For the latest on the Covid-19 outbreak, visit IOL's #Coronavirus trend page.\n\n** If you think you have been exposed to the Covid-19 virus, please call the 24-hour hotline on 0800 029 999 or visit sacoronavirus.co.za\n\nPretoria News", "METADATA": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "5A0910AA1A12E32A5352933CF5FD96E9", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "iQCzO2whcLNU6_F3xi1Dck7JMALz7869mBLTQf08wJo", "fb": {"app_id": 293175074032541}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Mental health patient safely back in Weskoppies hospital", "description": "He was found in one of the Covid-19 shelters in Durban, his father Francois Rabe said yesterday, adding that he had not seen him due to lockdown regulations.", "url": "https://www.iol.co.za/pretoria-news/news/mental-health-patient-safely-back-in-weskoppies-hospital-18705bf9-0f9e-417d-b8c5-4f7d83144bba", "image": {"identifier": "https://image-prod.iol.co.za/resize/1152x366?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/df7fb248-6c66-5cb2-9389-325cb2bcff2d&operation=CROP&offset=3x0&resize=1146x645", "secure_url": "https://image-prod.iol.co.za/resize/1152x366?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/df7fb248-6c66-5cb2-9389-325cb2bcff2d&operation=CROP&offset=3x0&resize=1146x645"}}, "description": "He was found in one of the Covid-19 shelters in Durban, his father Francois Rabe said yesterday, adding that he had not seen him due to lockdown regulations.", "twitter": {"site": "@IOL", "creator": "@IOL", "title": "Mental health patient safely back in Weskoppies hospital", "description": "He was found in one of the Covid-19 shelters in Durban, his father Francois Rabe said yesterday, adding that he had not seen him due to lockdown regulations.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"src": "https://image-prod.iol.co.za/resize/1152x366?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/df7fb248-6c66-5cb2-9389-325cb2bcff2d&operation=CROP&offset=3x0&resize=1146x645"}}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
