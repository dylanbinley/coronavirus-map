The bloody dream of the Japanese military caste vanished in the text of a note to the Four Powers accepting the terms of the Potsdam ultimatum of July 26, 1945.\u201d\n\nCrowds celebrate the end of World War II near the corner of Salina and Fayette in Syracuse on the evening of Aug. 14, 1945. Joe Rensin | The Post-Standard\n\nIt is probably safe to assume that many of that morning\u2019s Post-Standard were read by people just returning home from celebrating the news of the American victory the night before or through bleary eyes from one of the biggest parties the city had ever seen.\n\nThe newspaper reported that Syracusans grabbed a hold of every noisemaker they could find, whether it was pots and pans, car horns, whistles, or the horns being sold on every corner for 25 cents, to celebrate \"the best news of the past 3 and a half years.\"\n\nIt was said people gathered downtown, \"as if they had a previous engagement.\" Police officers directed traffic so that the whole width of S. Salina Street was open for an impromptu pedestrian parade.\n\nCars were loaded to capacity, young boys and girls sat on fenders or stood on running boards. One two-seat coupe carried 15 youngsters.\n\nCelebrations were noisy and spontaneous, but they were peaceful and happy, with no major destruction reported by police. The Post-Standard said that the celebrations were \"in tune with the hopeful new era.\"\n\nLacking ticker tape, the streets of the city were covered in torn leaflets and office stationary thrown from the Chimes Building and other office buildings.\n\nSoldiers and sailors and marines, \"with lipstick-smeared faces,\" linked arms with strangers, sat on shoulders, and joined civilians in \"snakelines\" through the streets.\n\nAnd it was not just young people. Husbands and wives with children joined the party. A \"gray-haired woman\" was blowing a noisemaker with all of her strength.\n\nAnother woman, about 60, on East Genesee St., was clapping two kettle-tops together.\n\nSyracuse celebrates the surrender of Japan on the night of Aug. 14, 1945.\n\nA car parked near the Onondaga Hotel was spotted with four women and one man inside, with tears streaming down their faces.\n\nWhen the news of the surrender made it to the Persian terrace room of the Hotel Syracuse, waitresses told diners and several employees, with loved ones in the service, began to weep quietly.\n\nMilt Hert and his trio were on stage but decided to not play their usual \u201cbouncy tunes,\u201d but instead their first full number was \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner,\u201d which brought the diners to their feet.\n\nKids celebrate the end of the war while riding on a \"jalopy\" in downtown Syracuse on Aug. 14, 1945.\n\nFor more quiet reflection, many in Syracuse gathered at Assumption Church for prayers.\n\nV-J Day in Syracuse.\n\nCars crowd Salina Street on the evening of Aug. 14, 1945.\n\nFour sailors celebrate the end of World War on Aug. 14, 1945 on Salina Street.\n\n- Pages from the Aug. 15, 1945 edition of the Post-Standard celebrate the news of the surrender of Japan, ending World War II.
