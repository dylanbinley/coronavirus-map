The flick is still regarded warmly for its many delights, not the least of which was its killer prologue, featuring Dan Aykroyd and Albert Brooks as motorists on a stretch of lonely road late at night. Three of its four segments were remakes of classic Twilight Zone episodes, and two of those can safely be singled out as among the scariest, most bizarre stories to ever appear in a PG-rated movie: you had Joe Dante, right smack in between The Howling and Gremlins, offering up his take on the all-powerful, malevolent little boy from \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" and Mad Max director George Miller putting John Lithgow through the terrors originally experienced by William Shatner in \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet.\" Oddly, the only segment that failed to land was the one directed by one of the film's producers, the great Steven Spielberg \u2014 a retelling of the little-remembered episode \"Kick the Can.\"\n\nThe first segment was the only one to tell an original story, and it, too, was helmed by one of the movie's producers and its driving creative force, An American Werewolf in London director John Landis. Unfortunately, that segment would become the basis for one of the greatest tragedies in the history of the motion picture industry \u2014 one that carried ripple effects which linger to this day. This is the story of the real-life tragedy behind Twilight Zone: The Movie.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://img1.looper.com/img/gallery/the-real-life-tragedy-behind-twilight-zone-the-movie/intro-1597346115.jpg", "title": "The real-life tragedy behind Twilight Zone: The Movie", "description": "Twilight Zone: The Movie contains some effective moments of horror that pay suitable tribute to the classic series -- but the real terror took place behind the scenes.
