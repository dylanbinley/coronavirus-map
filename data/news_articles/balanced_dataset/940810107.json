To these groups of people we want to remind them that Mr. President\u2019s tenure is just three years but Nigeria remains till God calls. So will you because of three years pull down the nation on all of us?\n\n\u201cWe have heard some Governors and individuals making reckless statements, some even treasonable. Yes we know and support freedom of expression which is paramount but will you in the name of freedom of expression destroy the nation that gave you an identity?\n\n\u201cWe believe that Nigeria is passing through a trying time that calls for men of goodwill to stand to be counted. And it so happened that God made it possible for President Muhammadu Buhari to be at the helm at this point in time.\n\n\u201cTo this end, what is required of Nigerians as patriotic citizens is to give Mr. President all the support he needs not because you like him but for the sake of our nation and future of our children.\n\nMesele observed the Buhari administration \u201cis winning the war against insecurity and all is needed is for Nigerians to accord the security agencies due support.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "The Civil Society Organizations in Defence for National Security has accused some unpatriotic Nigerians of plans to destabilise....", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Group warns against security breaches | The Nation Nigeria", "description": "The Civil Society Organizations in Defence for National Security has accused some unpatriotic Nigerians of plans to destabilise....", "url": "https://thenationonlineng.net/group-warns-against-security-breaches/", "site_name": "Latest Nigeria News, Nigerian Newspapers, Politics", "image": {"identifier": "https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG-20200814-WA0006.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 400}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenationng", "published_time": "2020-08-14T14:47:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T16:17:32+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 124339121242023}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@thenationnews", "site": "@thenationnews"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-Logo.jpg"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
