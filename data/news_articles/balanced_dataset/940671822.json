On our part as an agency, we will not relent on our efforts to ensure a safe and secure maritime domain in line with our mandate.\n\n\u201cThe Suppression of Piracy and Other Maritime Crimes (SPOMO) Act 2019 has come to stay and it is victory for Nigeria as a whole as we are determined more than ever before to take our rightful place in the comity of maritime nations.\u201d", "METADATA": {"application-name": "Court convicts three for piracy", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "Top Stories", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "By Muyiwa Lucas The Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, has convicted three persons accused of hijackng an Equatorial Guinean flagged vessel MV ELOBEY VI, off the country\u2019s coast on March 21.
