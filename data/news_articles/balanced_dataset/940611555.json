Dr. Charity Ido, while presenting the Report at Plenary, cited the refusal of council officials to retire Advances granted them for official assignments and failure to reply to audit queries as at when due, as some observations in the process of the 2014 Audited Accounts of Local Government Councils.\n\nShe listed negligence by Finance Directors and Internal Auditors in the signing and certification of payment vouchers before payment, refusal of Council Officials and former political office holders to respond to the invitation of the Public Accounts and report of some missing vouchers in some Local Government Councils among other violations.\n\nThe House after considering the Report in the Committee of the Whole, resolved that officers linked with cases of missing payment vouchers be sanctioned appropriately.\n\nThe Lawmakers urged the Auditor General for Local Governments and the State Accountant General to design workable modalities to ensure that all arrears of advances are either retired, refunded, or written off, while council staff should be adequately trained and retrained.\n\nThey equally recommended, \u201cthat Officers who refuse to respond to Audit Queries should be sanctioned in accordance with relevant provisions of the Civil Service rules; that the Local Government Service Commission should set up appropriate monitoring organ to ensure that the various Internal Control weaknesses in the Councils are addressed.\u201d\n\nVanguard\n\nKindly Share This Story:", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=1300", "fb": {"pages": 125111084176530, "app_id": 1281965775160257}, "OBKey": "KoeDKhtk63NPK0HQB1Wydg==", "description": "Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly has proposed free and compulsory medical care for victims of rape in the state", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Akwa Ibom Assembly proposes free treatment for rape victims", "description": "Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly has proposed free and compulsory medical care for victims of rape in the state", "url": "https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/08/akwa-ibom-assembly-proposes-free-treatment-for-rape-victims/", "site_name": "Vanguard News", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Akwa-Ibom-map.jpeg?fit=1280%2C720&ssl=1", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/vanguardngr", "published_time": "2020-08-13T19:05:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T21:25:41+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@vanguardngrnews", "site": "@vanguardngrnews"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "google-site-verification": "AjRfeo4BMZn8J99wiq7X1DKIfO_z-Dnma_6csxvuRRg", "alexaVerifyID": "GKUIyYVwwNAjNpxpU_bP3ZbGFeo", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/favicon.png?fit=16%2C16&ssl=1"}}}
