That changes the nature of negotiations,\" Ghani said.\n\n\"This time has to either be used productively which all of us are praying for, or it can turn into destruction.\"\n\nwat-jds-us/st\n\nVideo: US court issues summons for Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman (Al Jazeera)", "METADATA": {"civicscience": {"jspoll-hostname": "www138.civicscience.com"}, "application-name": "Taliban inmates danger 'to the world': Afghan president", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "World News", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Hundreds of Taliban inmates that are set to be released as a precondition to peace talks with Kabul pose a danger \"to the world\", Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said Thursday. \"We have now paid the major instalment on cost and that means peace will have consequences,\" he added, noting that the release of \"hardened criminals\" and drug dealers was \"likely to pose a danger both to us and to (America) and to the world\".", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}}}
