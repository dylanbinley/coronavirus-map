Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as a moderate from the moment presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden selected her as his running mate -- but she campaigned over the past year as an unabashed progressive.\n\nThe New York Times was roasted for immediately calling Harris a \u201cpragmatic moderate\u201d when alerting Biden\u2019s decision, but that was only the beginning of what critics feel appears to be a coordinated message.\n\nCONSERVATIVES REACT TO HARRIS AS BIDEN RUNNING MATE, BLAST NY TIMES FOR \u2018PRAGMATIC MODERATE\u2019 DESCRIPTOR\n\nConservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News he finds the \u201cmedia\u2019s coordinated gaslighting of Kamala Harris\u2019 record absolutely hilarious\u201d because she was treated much differently during her presidential bid.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember Harris ever describing herself as a moderate. Indeed, Harris chose to run as an ultra-progressive,\u201d Barron said. \u201cTo quote Maya Angelou, when someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.\u201d\n\n\"Breaking News: Sen. Kamala Harris of California is Joe Biden\u2019s pick for vice president. A pragmatic moderate, she is the first Black woman on a major party ticket,\" the Times tweeted in alerting Biden's choice in a message that would set the tone for coverage of the news.\n\nABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos declared on Wednesday that Harris \u201ccomes from the middle of the road, moderate wing of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nStephanopoulos added, \u201cNot the first choice of progressives but Joe Biden banking that this historic move as the first woman of color on a national ticket will overcome that.\"\n\nABC\u2019S GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS SAYS KAMALA HARRIS IS FROM \u2018MODERATE WING\u2019 OF DEMOCRATIC PARTY\n\nMedia Research Center vice president Dan Gainor said it\u2019s a \u201claughable narrative\u201d to label Harris a moderate.\n\n\u201cCompared to Karl Marx or your average journalist, maybe,\u201d Gainor told Fox News. \u201cIt's no surprise that former Clinton staffer-turned-ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos and The New York Times both called Harris \u2018moderate.\u2019 This is just part of the way the press tries to craft a narrative to make leftists more marketable to voters.\u201d\n\nDuring her own presidential run, Harris expressed her support for the Green New Deal, Medicare-for-all, decriminalizing illegal border crossings, and gun buybacks -- but she has been billed as a moderate several times on CNN since she was added to the Democratic ticket.\n\n\u201cSenator Harris is viewed as much more of a moderate within the Democratic Party. So much so, that she was even attacked by progressives as not progressive enough during the Democratic primary in 2020,\u201d CNN White House correspondent Jeremy Diamond said on Wednesday.\n\nCNN\u2019s S.E. Cupp echoed the comments by saying, \u201cWhat I've said about Kamala is that for moderates and rights, independents even conservative Never Trumpers, she's not a bridge too far.\u201d\n\nPolitical pundit Sophia Nelson appeared on CNN to claim that \u201cWhite women, moderate and independent women\u201d won\u2019t consider Harris \u201cscary,\u201d while Dr. Cornell West admitted he\u2019s \u201cradical\u201d but dismissed the notion Harris is, too.\n\n\u201cMy dear Sister Harris is not a radical. She is a -- she's a centrist and a moderate,\u201d West said on \u201cAnderson Cooper 360.\u201d\n\nFormer Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and Planned Parenthood CEO Alexis McGill Johnson were among a group of influential women who sent a letter to media industry leaders last week urging them to avoid stereotypes when covering Biden\u2019s female running mate. Gainor feels the letter is proof that nothing should be considered off-limits when it comes to manipulating media coverage of the Democratic ticket.\n\nGROUP CALLED \u2018WE HAVE HER BACK\u2019 WARNS AGAINST \u2018SEXIST\u2019 OR \u2018RACIST\u2019 COVERAGE OF BIDEN VP PICK\n\n\u201cWe know several prominent leftist women posted an open letter trying to work the refs about how to cover Biden's VP pick -- even before the name was announced,\u201d Gainor said. \u201cIt wouldn't surprise anyone to know that the DNC or other top Democrats were working the phones and email pushing friendly journalists to give Harris sufficient support.\u201d\n\nGainor said the situation reminds him of the infamous \u201cJournoList scandal where left-wing activists and reporters were working behind the scenes to manipulate the news\u201d back in 2010.\n\n\u201cThat kind of backroom cooperation still happens, but it might be less formal,\u201d Gainor said.\n\nFox News media analyst Howard Kurtz isn\u2019t sure if the media is doing it on purpose, but he\u2019s positive it clearly wants to portray Harris as a moderate.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris is getting walk-on-water coverage, it\u2019s absolutely stunning, I mean, she\u2019s a ground-breaking pick, she\u2019s the first Black woman, as you know, on a major party\u2019s ticket, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants and probably a net plus for Biden,\u201d Kurtz said. \u201cBut there is this effort by the media, conscious or unconscious, to say, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s a moderate just like Joe Biden.\u2019\u201d\n\nNEW YORK TIMES PANNED AFTER OP-ED CLAIMS IT'S BEEN '36 YEARS' SINCE A MAN AND A WOMAN RAN TOGETHER ON DEM TICKET\n\nKurtz said the narrative that Harris is a moderate is \u201conly true if you mean \u2018more moderate than AOC,\u2019\u201d obviously referring to the far-left Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\n\u201cThis is the most liberal ticket in ticket in Democratic Party history,\u201d Kurtz said. \u201cJournalists need to take a fair, tough look at her record.\u201d\n\nU.S. Senate hopeful Rik Mehta, who recently won the Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat in New Jersey, feels the narrative was strategically planned.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, it\u2019s coordinated. Listen, if I read Kamala\u2019s policies to the mainstream media outlet but kept her name anonymous, they\u2019d assume I was talking about left-wing Bernie Sanders,\u201d Mehta told Fox News. \u201cBut, when I reveal the name to be Kamala Harris, they programmatically write down \u2018moderate.\u2019\u201d\n\nMehta said Sen. Harris supports defunding the police while funding late-term abortions and pondered how she could possibly be considered moderate by a nonpartisan journalist.\n\n\u201cThe mainstream media hacks and Democrats are working together to cover up her radical record from voters and paint her to be someone she\u2019s not. So, yes, it is a coordinated effort to conveniently rewrite facts to fit their narrative. It\u2019s too coincidental to be just a coincidence,\u201d Mehta said.\n\nThe New York Times has also been criticized for fawning over Harris with a massive frontpage spread when Mike Pence only received a tiny blurb when he was selected back in 2016 to be then-candidate Donald Trump\u2019s running mate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, according to a GovTrack analysis, Harris ranked as the \"most liberal\" senator in 2019, outranking both Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nHowever, members of the mainstream media continue to downplay her progressive record and describe her as a moderate. Washington Post columnist David Byler even declared in the headline of an op-ed that Harris is a \"small-c conservative, party-friendly pick\" for Biden.\n\n\u201cThey paint her as a moderate because the mainstream media has been actively embracing should-be-disgraced Bush-era \u2018Never-Trumpers\u2019 from the Lincoln Project and elsewhere in order to elevate Biden's courting of \u2018moderate Republicans,\u2019\u201d progressive journalist and Status Coup founder Jordan Chariton told Fox News.\n\nFox News\u2019 Joseph A.
