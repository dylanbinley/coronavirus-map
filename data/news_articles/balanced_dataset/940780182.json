I will never forget it. You must write an undertaking.\u201d\n\nThe judge immediately dictated the wordings for the undertaking and Falabi wrote and signed to ensure that he or the law chambers would not abandon the case.\n\nThe wordings of the undertaking are: \u201cI, Oyekunle Falabi, representing the law firm of Victor Okpara, undertakes on behalf of the first defendant (Evans) in suit No. ID/590761, to represent him in defence of this matter at all times when the matter comes up in Justice Oshodi\u2019s Court.\n\n\u201cIn the event of any breach of this undertaking, the court is at liberty to report us to our national body, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA).\u201d\n\nAfter Falabi wrote the undertaking, Oshodi ordered that the document be witnessed and signed by the Lagos State Solicitor-General, Ms Titilayo Shitta-Bey, who represented the prosecution.\n\nFollowing the signing of the undertaking by Shitta-Bey, lawyers for Evans\u2019s co-defendants requested an adjournment to prepare for defence.\n\nResponding to the defence counsel\u2019s request for adjournment, Shitta-Bey told the court, \u201cCounsel should take the undertaking seriously.\n\n\u201cConstitutionally, they are guaranteed adequate time to prepare for their defence but not indefinite time.\u201d\n\nOshodi adjourned the case to Oct. 16 for defence.\n\nNAN reports that Evans is standing trial alongside Uche Amadi, Ogechi Uchechukwu, Chilaka Ifeanyi, Okwuchukwu Nwachukwu and Victor Aduba for alleged kidnap of the Chief Executive Officer of Maydon Pharmaceutical Ltd., Mr Donatius Dunu.\n\nEarlier in a ruling, Oshodi rejected the no-case submissions of Uchechukwu (third defendant), Ifeanyi (fourth defendant), Nwachukwu (fifth defendant)/and Aduba (sixth defendant) and ordered them to open their defence.\n\nOshodi said the prosecution presented evidence to the court that linked the four co-defendants to the alleged crime.\n\nHe noted that during the trial, the fourth prosecution witness, Insp. Idowu Haruna told the court that during interrogation, Evans identified his other gang members to include the third, fourth, fifth and sixth defendants.\n\nThe judge said: \u201cThis witness (Haruna) also mentioned that the second defendant is the husband of the third defendant.\n\n\u201cThe third defendant, upon his arrest, had linked the first defendant (Evans) to the alleged crime and said the first defendant was their leader.\n\n\u201cThe victim (Dunu) in his court evidence, said that though he was blindfolded, his food was being made in captivity by a woman whose voice was that of the third defendant, the wife of the second defendant.\n\n\u201cThere is a prima facie case as the first defendant also implicated the co-defendants in Exhibit 10.\n\n\u201cThe court must look at the totality of the evidence so far before it. The prosecution has laid out a prima facie case.\n\nAccording to the judge, the court finds and holds that no evidence has been discredited on the face of the document.\n\n\u201cThe third, fourth, fifth and sixth defendants are now called to open their defence.\u201d\n\nAccording to the prosecution, the defendants allegedly kidnapped Dunu on Ilupeju Road in Lagos on Feb. 14, 2017, and collected 223,000 Euros (N100m) as ransom from his family.\n\nDunu who was allegedly held captive by the defendants because his family had not paid an additional ransom, was said to have escaped captivity and alerted the police.\n\nFour witnesses, including Dunu, testified on behalf of the prosecution which closed its case on Jan. 10.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0,minimum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=no", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "description": "A mild drama unfolded during the trial of alleged kidnap kingpin, Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike (alias Evans), before an Ikeja High Court, when the judge,", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Billionaire kidnapper: You must undertake to finish Evans\u2019 case - Judge tells 5th counsel - Daily Post Nigeria", "description": "A mild drama unfolded during the trial of alleged kidnap kingpin, Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike (alias Evans), before an Ikeja High Court, when the judge,", "url": "https://dailypost.ng/2020/08/14/billionaire-kidnapper-you-must-undertake-to-finish-evans-case-judge-tells-5th-counsel/", "site_name": "Daily Post Nigeria", "image": {"identifier": "https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/evans-1.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyPostNigeria/", "published_time": "2020-08-14T14:16:05+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 420332301344305}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@dailypostngr", "site": "@dailypostngr"}, "generator": "AMP Plugin v1.5.5; mode=standard", "monsterinsights-version": "7.12.2", "monsterinsights-amp-version": "1.4.7", "monsterinsights-tracking-user": "true", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cropped-DAILY-POST-ICON-270x270.jpg"}}}
