He created us not as objects but as people loved and capable of loving; He has created us in His image and likeness. In this way He has given us a unique dignity, calling us to live in communion with Him, in communion with our sisters and our brothers, with respect for all creation,\u201d Pope Francis said.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has highlighted how vulnerable and interconnected we are all. If we do not take care of each other, starting with the least, with those who are most affected, including creation, we cannot heal the world,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the general audience, Pope Francis met with United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet at the Vatican.\n\nIn recent months, Bachelet, the former president of Chile, has spoken out about child marriage in Somalia, human rights violations in Yemen, and the Iranian government\u2019s repression of civil society.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights\u2019 spokesperson has also expressed concern over the application of China\u2019s National Security Law in Hong Kong and Lebanon\u2019s socio-economic crisis. The Vatican has not released further details of the content of the pope\u2019s meeting with Bachelet.\n\n\n\nPope Francis had said at his general audience that humans have \u201cinalienable dignity\u201d because humanity was created in the image of God, quoting the Second Vatican Council\u2019s pastoral constitution, Gaudium et Spes. He said that this lies at \u201cthe foundation of all social life and determines its operative principles.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn modern culture, the closest reference to the principle of the inalienable dignity of the person is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Saint John Paul II defined as a \u2018milestone on the long and difficult path of the human race\u2019 and as \u2018one of the highest expressions of the human conscience,\u2019\u201d Pope Francis said.\n\n\u201cRights are not only individual, but also social; they are of peoples, nations. The human being, indeed, in his or her personal dignity, is a social being, created in the image of God, One and Triune,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are social beings; we need to live in this social harmony, but when there is selfishness, our outlook does not reach others, the community, but focuses on ourselves, and this makes us ugly, nasty and selfish, destroying harmony.\u201d\n\nThe pope\u2019s reflection on human dignity is part of a weekly series of catechesis on Catholic social teaching, which he began last week. Pope Francis said that he wants to \u201ctackle together the pressing issues that the pandemic has highlighted, especially social diseases.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet us ask the Lord to give us eyes attentive to our brothers and sisters, especially those who are suffering. As Jesus\u2019s disciples we do not want to be indifferent or individualistic,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMay the Lord \u2018restore our sight\u2019 so as to rediscover what it means to be members of the human family. And may this sight be translated into concrete actions of compassion and respect for every person and of care and safeguarding of our common home.\u201d--CNA", "METADATA": {"google-site-verification": "BTsZiNvAWcjSPMloAtzfJqFitt0MT4et-KW7tEzwLk0", "abstract": "Catholic News,World Christian News,Malaysia Church,Religion Christianity", "Author": "Herald Malaysia Online.", "copyright": "Herald Malaysia Online", "Distribution": "global", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"type": "website", "url": "http://www.heraldmalaysia.com/index.php", "site_name": "Herald Malaysia Online", "author": "Herald Malaysia Online."}, "description": "Herald Malaysia - daily news source with Malaysian and Global coverage of the Catholic Churches.
