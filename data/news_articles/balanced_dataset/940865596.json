The tenants claim they had not been served written eviction notices to vacate the property prior to it being repossessed on Wednesday.\n\nGerry Ward, who had earlier been the tenants\u2019 landlord, said he had been involved with the property since around 2004. He said there was a legal dispute over it since 2017 with a property fund, Beltany Property Finance.\n\nHe said he had not been aware of the property\u2019s repossession until he was contacted by the tenants.\n\nA spokesman for Goldman Sachs, which controls Beltany, said the fund had sold the property on June 2nd, but was unable to disclose the name of the buyer citing confidentiality reasons.\n\nLandlords\u2019 representative organisation, IPOA, said tenants should not be caught up in disputes between property owners and financial institutions.\n\n\u201cWhile we are aware that difficulties arise in cases where repossession by financial institutions cause friction, the occupiers should not be involved. Legislation should be adhered to,\u201d the association said.\n\n\u201cWhere a dispute arises between property owner and tenant it may be referred to the RTB [Residential Tenancies Board] for resolution in an organised manner.\u201d\n\nA Garda spokesman said legal representatives of the property\u2019s owner attended Mountjoy Garda station on Wednesday \u201cto inform garda\u00ed that they intended to secure their premises\u201d.\n\nGarda\u00ed \u201cnoted the proposed activity but did not attend the premises at the time\u201d, he said.\n\nDuring the eviction a tenant made an emergency call to garda\u00ed at 11am, and a number of units attended the scene, but \u201cthe majority were quickly stood down\u201d, the spokesman said.\n\n\u201cSubsequently a number of Garda personnel remained at the scene with the primary function to prevent breaches of the peace and ensure the safety of all persons involved,\u201d he said.\n\nOn re-entering the house on Thursday tenants found significant damage including broken windows, doors and toilets.", "METADATA": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "description": "IPOA says tenants should not be caught up in disputes between owners and financial institutions", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom14330632"}, "news_keywords": "News, Social Affairs, Gerry Ward, Stephen Faughnan, Dublin Central, Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, Irish Property Owners Association, Irish Property Owners \u2019 Association, Goldman Sachs Group, Dublin(IE)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "all", "og": {"title": "Landlords\u2019 group concerned with manner of Dublin eviction", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/landlords-group-concerned-with-manner-of-dublin-eviction-1.4330632", "site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "IPOA says tenants should not be caught up in disputes between owners and financial institutions", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4330630&origw=1440", "secure_url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4330630&origw=1440", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IrishTimes", "creator": "@OliviaKellyIT", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/landlords-group-concerned-with-manner-of-dublin-eviction-1.4330632", "title": "Landlords\u2019 group concerned with manner of Dublin eviction", "description": "IPOA says tenants should not be caught up in disputes between owners and financial institutions", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4330630.1597430680!/image/image.jpg", "account_id": 15084853}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "fb": {"pages": 45441411157, "app_id": 1170474839675514}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
