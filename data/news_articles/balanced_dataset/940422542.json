Joyce was however remanded by the court.\n\n\n\nThe Prosecution led by Madam Linda Kunbuno, from AMA said on August 10, this year, Joyce was seen not wearing nose musk on two different occasions and was advised to wear one.\n\n\n\nShe said on August 11, this year, Joyce was again seen preaching at the ECG office in Accra Central and was using her handkerchief as a nose musk.\n\n\n\nProsecution said even though someone offered to buy one for her, she declined to take it, saying she was safe in using her handkerchief.\n\n\n\nShe said Joyce was later arrested by the COVID-19 Safety Task Force after she declined to wear the mask purchased for her.\n\n\n\nCurrently the COVID-19 Safety Task Force is made up of personnel the Military, Police, AMA, and Zoomlion.\n\n\n\nThey are to enforce the Directives on wearing of nose musk to contain the spread of COVID-19\n\nSource: GNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer : Opinions expressed here are those of the writers and do not reflect those of Peacefmonline.com.
