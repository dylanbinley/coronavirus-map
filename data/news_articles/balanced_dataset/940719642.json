Western leaders have said they will send aid directly to the Lebanese people and that billions of dollars will not be pumped into the country before major reforms take place.\n\nDuring a visit to Beirut last week, French President Emmanuel Macron met political leaders in Lebanon and called on them to create a \u201cnew political order.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Press Rescue teams search for missing people at the site of the Aug. 4 explosion that killed more than 170 people, injured thousands and caused widespread destruction, in Beirut, Lebanon, Friday, Aug. 14, 2020.

But documents have emerged in the wake of the explosion that show the country\u2019s top leadership and security officials were aware of the chemicals being stored in the city port.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Press Lebanese Foreign Minister Charbel Wehbe, left, speaks during a joint press conference with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif, outside the Lebanese foreign ministry damaged by last week's explosion that his the seaport of Beirut, Lebanon, Friday, Aug. 14, 2020. (AP Photo/Hussein Malla)\n\nLebanon\u2019s Parliament on Thursday approved a state of emergency in Beirut in its first session since the tragic explosion last week, granting the military sweeping powers amid rising popular anger and political uncertainty.\n\nSome 120 schools, used by 50,000 students, have been damaged. More than 1,000 of nearly 50,000 residential units were severely damaged, the U.N. report said.\n\nAt east 13 refugees, including at least two Palestinians, were among those killed and more than 170,000 residents' apartments were damaged, according to the U.N. report.\n\nDespite damage to the silos in the Beirut port, the U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said food shortages are not expected.\n\nThe blast struck Beirut in the midst of a crippling financial and economic crisis, and the U.N. predicted people will have difficulties restoring or fixing their homes. But at least 55% of buildings assessed were rented, which may allow people to move elsewhere, the U.N. said.\n\nAccording to the world body, the Beirut port is operating at 30% capacity and the Tripoli port in the country's north, at 70% . That is allowing for food and goods to continue to flow. The World Food Program is bringing in a three-month supply of wheat flour and grains.\n\nHowever, the U.N. humanitarian affairs agency said it is concerned about a surge in coronavirus cases, particularly as social distancing is relaxed during the widespread volunteering to help those affected by the blast and protests against the government and political elite.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Press Lebanese special forces soldiers who work to protect the visit of Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, stand guard outside the Lebanese foreign ministry damaged by last week's explosion that his the seaport of Beirut, Lebanon, Friday, Aug. 14, 2020.
