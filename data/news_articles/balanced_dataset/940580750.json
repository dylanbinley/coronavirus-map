Former newspaper-editor Harald Stanghelle is the author of the book, and beforehand, he had not thought that the King would want to be involved in the project.\n\nIn 2018 publisher Erling Kagge asked Harald Stanghelle if he would write a book based on conversations with King Harald. Stanghelle has now told the Norwegian press that he said yes in the safe assurance that King Harald would say no. Surprisingly, the King also said yes.\n\nStanghelle interviewed the King 11 times and the conversations took place at the Palace and at the royal farm at Bygd\u00f8y. The book, which has been named \u201cThe King Tells\u201d, will be published in mid-October. In the book, King Harald talks about himself as a part of Norway\u2019s history. The King gives a unique telling of his royal life since his childhood.\n\nStanghelle also revealed that several other royals have contributed to the book, which is supposed to offer exciting and new information. King Harald invited Princess Astrid to take part in one of the conversations about their war experiences and the return of the royal family from the United States in 1945. Queen Sonja and Crown Prince Haakon were also interviewed for the book.\n\nStanghelle emphasises that he was free to write the book as he wished. He said: \u201cThe King did not receive the questions in advance, nor did he ask for it. He has been very open and patient. With a certain amount of humour, he has answered my questions in every way. Several times, the King\u2019s answers surprised me.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "King Harald contributes to a new book about himself", "url": "https://royalcentral.co.uk/europe/norway/king-harald-contributes-to-a-new-book-about-himself-147192/", "description": "A new special book about King Harald will be published this autumn, and the King of Norway himself contributed much to the upcoming book.
