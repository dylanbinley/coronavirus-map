Photo: AP\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier in the week, Pompeo said in Prague that the young democracies in the region should embrace hard-won freedoms and counter threats from Russia and particularly China, which he said is in many ways more dangerous than the former Soviet Union.\n\n\"The CCP is already enmeshed in our economies, in our politics, in our societies in ways the Soviet Union never was,\" he told Czech lawmakers, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nIn Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian criticised Pompeo's \"Cold War mentality\" and \"selfish\" remarks.\n\n\"Wherever Pompeo goes, he's spreading political viruses and false information,\" he told reporters.\n\nFilip Sebok, a China analyst at the Association for International Affairs, a think tank based in Prague, said Pompeo tapped into the increasingly hawkish stance on China among some Czech politicians.\n\n\"Pompeo finds a really attentive audience in Prague, jumping into a very heated public debate on China where the 'hawkish' views on China developed quite independently of what is happening in the US,\" Sebok said.\n\n\"It remains to be seen if this will also push the Czech government to make a clearer decision on Chinese 5G providers.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.
