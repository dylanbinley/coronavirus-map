He has now spoken to his Russian counterpart, with the Kremlin announcing the two had discussed the situation.\n\n\u201cBoth sides expressed confidence that all existing problems will be settled soon. The main thing is to prevent destructive forces from using these problems to cause damage to mutually beneficial relations of the two countries within the Union State,\u201d said a statement on the Kremlin website.\n\nMeanwhile, Lukashenko has rejected the possibility of foreign mediation, proposed in particular by Poland and two Baltic countries.\n\n\u201cWe don't need any foreign government, we don't need any mediator,\u201d Lukashenko told a government meeting on Saturday, quoted by the state agency Belta. On Wednesday, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland had proposed a mediation plan to set up a \"national council\" to resolve the ongoing political crisis.\n\nDisputed election\n\nState agency Belta reported on Monday Lukashenko won 80.23% of the vote, while his main opponent Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, a former teacher, received just 9.9%.\n\nShe has now fled to Lithuania, from where she has called for mass peaceful protests in all major cities of Belarus, as she accused the authorities of creating a \"bloodbath\".\n\nHer husband, a former presidential candidate, was imprisoned during the election campaign.\n\nThere have been accusations that peaceful protesters have been tortured, after thousands of Belarusians were rounded up by police and detained in prisons. Many who have now been released claiming they were beaten and held in appalling conditions.\n\nAmnesty International says there is mounting evidence of the widespread torture of protesters.\n\nKilled protester was \u201cshot\u201d by police\n\nThe partner of the protester who died on Monday during protests in Minsk has accused the police of shooting him, dismissing the official account that her partner was killed when an explosive device he was about to throw at police blew up in his hand.\n\nElena German told The Associated Press that she was able to visit the morgue and see the body of Alexander Taraikovsky on Friday, saying: \"There is a seam in the chest area \u2014 the hole was sewn up, but there is a black bruise; it's small but we noticed. His hands and feet are completely intact, there are not even bruises...Obviously, it was a shot right in the chest.\u201d\n\nBelarus' Interior Ministry has declined to comment on the situation, beyond its initial claim that a protester died because of a hand-held explosive.\n\nGerman said she intends to seek a full investigation. She has called on a Belarusian human rights organisation for help, and wants international experts to take part in a probe.\n\n\u201cI am feeling outraged. I\u2019m angry. That is why I want to achieve justice, \u201dshe said.\n\nAbout 500 people came to pay last respects to Taraikovsky, who lay in an open casket. As the coffin was carried out, many dropped to one knee, weeping and exclaiming \"Long live Belarus.\"\n\nLukashenko has been in power since 1994, and is the only President Belarus has had. He has been labelled by some as the last dictator in Europe.", "METADATA": {"minutely-publisher": "MIN-20200", "description": "Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has spoken with Russian president Vladimir Putin, as unrest continues in the wake of the Belarusian presidential election.", "keywords": "Belarus,2020 Belarusian presidential election,Vladimir Putin,Alexander Lukashenko", "date.created": "2020-08-15 16:43:20", "date.available": "2020-08-15 16:43:20", "date.updated": "2020-08-15 16:43:31", "date.modified": "2020-08-15 16:43:31", "article": {"theme": "news", "published_time": "2020-08-15 16:43:20", "modified_time": "2020-08-15 16:43:31", "section": "news_news", "author": "Luke Hurst"}, "program.url": "web-digital-stories", "robots": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:standard", "news_keywords": "Belarus,2020 Belarusian presidential election,Vladimir Putin,Alexander Lukashenko", "og": {"locale": {"identifier": "en-GB", "alternate": "en-GB"}, "site_name": "euronews", "url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/08/15/lukashenko-calls-putin-as-demonstrators-gather-once-again-in-belarus", "type": "article", "title": "Lukashenko calls Putin as demonstrators gather once again in Belarus", "description": "Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has spoken with Russian president Vladimir Putin, as unrest continues in the wake of the Belarusian presidential election.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/88/61/48/1000x563_cmsv2_5b999536-485a-52fc-918b-a66f12f1db2f-4886148.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "type": "image/jpeg", "alt": "Lukashenko calls Putin as demonstrators gather once again in Belarus"}}, "twitter": {"site": "@euronews", "title": "Lukashenko calls Putin as demonstrators gather once again in Belarus", "description": "Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has spoken with Russian president Vladimir Putin, as unrest continues in the wake of the Belarusian presidential election.", "image": {"alt": "Lukashenko calls Putin as demonstrators gather once again in Belarus"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "images0": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/88/61/48/1000x563_cmsv2_5b999536-485a-52fc-918b-a66f12f1db2f-4886148.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 101402598109}, "sponsored": "no", "msapplication-TileColor": "#003865", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Euronews.com", "application-name": "Euronews.com", "msapplication-config": "browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-tooltip": "Euronews.com", "msapplication-window": "width=1280;height=1024", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#003865", "msapplication-starturl": "./", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/mstile-small.jpg", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/mstile-medium.jpg", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/mstile-wide.jpg", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/mstile-large.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1", "mobile-web-app-capable": "no"}}}
