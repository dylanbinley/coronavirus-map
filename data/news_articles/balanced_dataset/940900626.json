This is not the Arab world\u2019s most\n\npowerful nation like Egypt. This isn\u2019t even a country that has a contiguous\n\nborder with Israel.\u201d\n\nBarbara Slavin of the Atlantic Council, another Washington think-tank,\n\ndescribed the agreement as a \u201cgood move\u201d but \u201cnot earthshaking in view of the\n\ncovert ties the two countries have had for a very long time.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Vision for Peace\u2019 \u2013\n\nSince taking office, Trump has pledged to apply his self-proclaimed deal-\n\nmaking skills to resolving the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nHe charged Kushner, his son-in-law, with the daunting task of hammering out\n\nMiddle East peace.\n\nBut the Palestinians have refused to play along with an administration seen\n\nas staunchly pro-Israel, and rejected the US president\u2019s \u201cVision for Peace\u201d\n\nunveiled in January.\n\nMiller said the Israel-UAE normalization agreement does little to advance\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d of overall Middle East peace.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he added, \u201cthe administration\u2019s motivation has nothing to do\n\nwith Israeli-Palestinian peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about domestic policy,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThis is about making the\n\npresident look good, demonstrating some measure of competency and fulfilling\n\nat least some degree of what the administration claimed it would do from the\n\nbeginning \u2014 which is to make peace between Israel and the Arab world.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Miller said, \u201cit helps give rise to the image that there is an\n\nanti-Iran coalition.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to get very far,\u201d he continued, unless Trump\n\ncan get other Arab countries such as Morocco, Bahrain and Oman to sign on.\n\nTrump has made it clear that his main objective in the Middle East is\n\nneutralizing Iran\n\n. He has called on several occasions for the creation of a NATO of Middle\n\nEast nations, an alliance which has failed to come together.\n\nSince unilaterally repudiating the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, Trump has\n\nalso found himself isolated by other Western countries when it comes to the\n\nIslamic Republic.\n\nThis isolation came to the fore at the United Nations on Friday when the\n\nSecurity Council soundly rejected a US resolution to extend an arms embargo\n\non Iran that is due to expire in October, with only two votes in favor.\n\nChina and Russia \u2014 who had intended to veto the resolution even if it did\n\npass \u2014 voted against it, while 11 other nations including France, Germany\n\nand the UK abstained.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the result \u201cinexcusable.\u201d\n\nThe United States may now try to force the Security Council to reimpose UN\n\nsanctions on Iran which were lifted in 2015 as part of the nuclear deal.\n\nWashington has threatened to use a contested argument that it remains a\n\n\u201cparticipant\u201d in the nuclear deal \u2014 the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \u2013\n\n\u2013 despite its withdrawal.\n\nAnd if UN sanctions are not extended, the argument goes, the United States\n\ncan force their return if it sees Iran as being in violation of the JCPOA\u2019s\n\nterms.\n\nSlavin said that is unlikely to get very far.\n\n\u201cThe US is in a weak and legally dubious position on that and this proto-\n\nnormalization between the UAE and Israel will have zero effect,\u201d she said.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "http://www.bssnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/inter-04-2.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.0.10", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.bssnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cropped-BSS-Final-Logo-300x300.jpg"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
