Aurora is taking all precautions to prevent the spread of coronavirus, it said.\n\nBrazil's Agriculture Ministry said earlier that it was seeking clarification on the matter.\n\n\"There is no scientific evidence of transmission of the COVID-19 virus from frozen food or food packaging,\" the ministry said, citing the United Nations and the World Health Organization.\n\nThe Shenzhen government said a sample taken from the surface of the imported frozen chicken wings had tested positive.\n\nBut the Brazilian ministry emphasized that the Shenzhen government statement said that other samples of the same cargo tested negative, as did everyone who came into contact with the meat.\n\nRegistered meat plants in Brazil follow strict sanitary procedures and their products are safe, it said.\n\nAs of Wednesday, six Brazilian meat plants remained blocked from exporting to China, according to the Chinese customs agency's website, after they were barred over concerns about coronavirus amid reports of thousands of cases spreading throughout the industry.\n\nShares in Brazil's largest chicken exporter, BRF SA , fell by more than 7% in late trading, with others in the sector showing smaller losses.\n\nBRF, whose results were affected by higher production costs due to the pandemic, said testing meat products ahead of shipment to China is \"extremely complex.\"\n\n(Reporting by Jake Spring in Brasilia, Ana Mano and Nayara Figueiredo in Sao Paulo and Dominique Patton in Beijing Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Jonathan Oatis and Sonya Hepinstall)\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=0, initial-scale=0.80", "google-site-verification": "0PIobvjMFhTtAItsIxydl-1fnCSPwJTrbo46FZhxQpo", "msvalidate.01": "43FB4D70D1695A2399A02188D940C120", "fb": {"pages": 168811439104}, "description": "HEALTH - CORONAVIRUS/BRAZIL-CHINA (UPDATE 2):UPDATE 2-Coronavirus contaminated chicken came from Brazil's Aurora, Chinese local govt says", "author": "Thomson Reuters Foundation", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@tr_foundation", "creator": "Thomson Reuters Foundation", "title": "Coronavirus contaminated chicken came from Brazil's Aurora, Chinese local govt says", "description": "HEALTH - CORONAVIRUS/BRAZIL-CHINA (UPDATE 2):UPDATE 2-Coronavirus contaminated chicken came from Brazil's Aurora, Chinese local govt says", "image": "http://news.trust.org/application/assets/genx/images/default-sharing-tile.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "news.trust.org", "title": "Coronavirus contaminated chicken came from Brazil's Aurora, Chinese local govt says", "description": "HEALTH - CORONAVIRUS/BRAZIL-CHINA (UPDATE 2):UPDATE 2-Coronavirus contaminated chicken came from Brazil's Aurora, Chinese local govt says", "image": "https://d8zcwdvc14g2e.cloudfront.net/contentAsset/image/875708d1-98fc-40d5-81a8-a918188f3243/image/byInode/1/filter/Resize,Jpeg/jpeg_q/70/resize_w/1400", "url": "https://news.trust.org/item/20200813151213-unwg6/", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "News"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": true, "NOTES": ["Food Distribution"]}}
