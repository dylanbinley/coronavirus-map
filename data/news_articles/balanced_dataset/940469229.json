Ryan we need your help up here. Get in touch with us. My number is on the internet,\u201d said the premier.\n\n\u201cSeth Rogen another outstanding British Columbian, we need to communicate with people who aren\u2019t hearing us. The two of you alone could help us in that regard,\u201d said Horgan.\n\nIn the past weeks, BC health officials have addressed the issue of younger British Columbians having large indoor gatherings and parties, which they attribute to an uptick of COVID-19 cases in the province.\n\nEarlier this month, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said, \u201cOverlapping social circles where private parties [have occurred] over the period of the past few weeks have led to people passing it to their friends and family.\u201d\n\nLast week, health officials announced dozens of people caught the virus after attending a private party in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.\n\n\u201cThere is a host of other options available and we\u2019re working as hard as we can to enlist a number of prominent British Columbians and prominent Canadians to help get that message through to the demographic that clearly isn\u2019t hearing our message,\u201d continued Horgan.\n\nBC announced 85 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Horgan calls on Reynolds, Rogen to spread awareness on COVID-19 safety to young British Columbians | News", "url": "https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/premier-horgan-ryan-reynolds-seth-rogen-covid-safety", "description": "John Horgan is hoping to get the help of Ryan Reynolds and Seth Rogen to get the message across about the importance of following COVID-19 protocols.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.dailyhive.com/20200323193620/Screen-Shot-2020-03-23-at-7.35.52-PM-500x257.png", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "twitter": {"title": "Horgan calls on Reynolds, Rogen to spread awareness on COVID-19 safety to young British Columbians | News", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/premier-horgan-ryan-reynolds-seth-rogen-covid-safety", "description": "John Horgan is hoping to get the help of Ryan Reynolds and Seth Rogen to get the message across about the importance of following COVID-19 protocols.", "image": "https://images.dailyhive.com/20200323193620/Screen-Shot-2020-03-23-at-7.35.52-PM-500x257.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 628988490846386}, "description": "John Horgan is hoping to get the help of Ryan Reynolds and Seth Rogen to get the message across about the importance of following COVID-19 protocols.", "theme-color": "#031831", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": true, "NOTES": []}}
