The suspension, the EU said, was necessitated by systemic human rights violations.\n\n\u201cThe EU\u2019s decision to partially withdraw Cambodia\u2019s duty-free quota-free access to the EU market is now effective,\u201d read a statement issued by the EU Commission on Wednesday.\n\nWith the sanctions, some 20 percent of Cambodia\u2019s total exports to the European markets are affected, including those of garment and footwear products and travel goods \u2013 among which are Cambodia\u2019s key products for EU exports. Garments account for two-thirds of the now-tariffed products, with footwear products accounting for 20 percent, according to EU Commission data.\n\n\u201cSince February 2020, when the EU\u2019s decision on partial withdrawal was taken, the Cambodian Government could at any time have taken the necessary steps to fulfill the conditions allowing the European Union to fully restore EBA preferential access to the EU market. This remains the case.\u201d\n\nEU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said Brussels could reverse course if Cambodia improves its human rights and political situation, including the political rehabilitation of banned opposition politicians and revocation of amendments to the much-criticized political party and NGO laws.\n\n\u201cI stand ready to continue our engagement and to restore fully free access to the EU market for products from Cambodia provided we see substantial improvement in that respect,\u201d Hogan said.\n\nEU was one of the largest Cambodia\u2019s export destination. Bilateral trades rose to $6.59 billion in which Cambodia had a vast surplus in 2019.\n\nEU kicked off its review process of Cambodia\u2019s eligibility to the \u2018Everything But Arms\u2019 trade preferences scheme in February 2019, following the Cambodian People\u2019s Party\u2019s complete sweep of the National Assembly and Senate elections in 2018.\n\nThe complete control of the legislature was facilitated by the dissolution of the principal opposition, Cambodia National Rescue Party, which was dissolved in November 2017 and then-president Kem Sokha imprisoned on treason charges. The government also launched a sweeping crackdown on critics, civil society, and the free press.\n\n\u201cThe partial EBA withdrawal is a direct consequence of the actions of the Royal Government of Cambodia, which failed to adequately protect and promote the human rights of its citizens,\u201d said Chak Sopheap, executive director at the Cambodian Center for Human Right, in a statement.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, 2020 has witnessed a renewed crackdown on the exercise of fundamental freedoms and a further weakening of civic space,\u201d Chak Sopheap added.\n\nForeign Ministry\u2019s spokesperson Koy Kuong said Cambodia\u2019s government adheres to its previous statements in responses to EU\u2019s demands. Despite multiple calls from industry bodies, civil society and activists to improve the rights situation, the government has continued its crackdown on dissent and political participation.\n\n\u201c[The sanction enforcements] will not hurt EU-Cambodian relations,\u201d Koy Kuong told VOA Khmer through a messaging application. \u201cBilateral cooperation on various sectors will continue and we will even enhance them.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, even with this kind of decision on EBA, the Royal Government of Cambodia remains highly resolved to continue promoting and improving human rights, labor rights, and democracy further.\u201d\n\nOthers are not convinced. Former CNRP lawmaker Ou Chanrath said the state would further extend its crackdown in a show of \u201cdefiance\u201d aimed at the EU\u2019s decision.\n\nHe said those who would pay the price would be critics living inside the country and opposition leader Kem Sokha, whose prolonged case and trial will become \u201cmore complicated to find a way out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is such a loss for Cambodia with detrimental effects on poor citizens,\u201d Ou Chanrath said, referring to some 700,000 workers serving in the garment and footwear industries.\n\nSome 230 factories had been either halted their production or closed with a total of some 93,000 workers out of work as of August 11, according to Labor Ministry\u2019s spokesperson Heng Sour. Factories in Cambodia have been hit hard by the COVID-19 economic global slowdown because of falling orders.\n\nKen Loo, secretary-general at the Garment Manufacturers Association of Cambodia (GMAC), said the EU\u2019s partial withdrawal of the EBA would further burden the garment industry that has been hit hard by COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe regret that the EU did not consider our pleas [for relief] and moved to withdraw 20 percent of our export to the European market,\u201d Ken Loo told VOA Khmer in a telephone call.\n\n\u201cIt must affect our industry,\u201d he said adding that he expected a worse second half of the year for the garment industry.\n\nCambodian government would release some $1.164 billion as a leeway to nurture the economy dealing with the impacts by the EBA\u2019s partial loss and the COVID-19 pandemic, said Finance Ministry\u2019s spokesperson Meas Soksensan.\n\nAs factory orders slow down, global brands have also expressed concern over Cambodia embrace of coal power plants, which they say contradicts their commitment to moving towards renewable energies, even warning this could affect sourcing from Cambodia.\n\nH&M spokesperson Ulrika Isaksson said without the EBA it would be hard to facilitate the changes needed in the garment sector, affecting the competitiveness of Cambodian exports.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to sourcing in Cambodia going forward, we do see that a lack of adequate initiatives in developing the Cambodian garment industry, and the partial withdrawal of the EBA privileges, as problematic,\u201d she said in an email.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore evaluating if and how our business and production strategy in Cambodia will change.\u201d", "METADATA": {"title": "EU Trade Sanction Against Cambodia\u2019s Crackdown Enters Into Force", "description": "EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said Brussels could reverse course if Cambodia improves its human rights and political situation, including the political rehabilitation of banned opposition politicians and revocation of amendments to the much-criticized political party and NGO laws.", "keywords": "news, cambodia, khmer, us, usa, america, world, international, politics, human rights, environment, news on cambodia, culture, hollywood, khmer rouge, economy, policy, analysis, issues in the news, current affairs,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msvalidate.01": "3286EE554B6F672A6F2E608C02343C0E", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "VOA", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=632618796, app-argument=//5541730.ltr", "og": {"title": "EU Trade Sanction Against Cambodia\u2019s Crackdown Enters Into Force", "description": "EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said Brussels could reverse course if Cambodia improves its human rights and political situation, including the political rehabilitation of banned opposition politicians and revocation of amendments to the much-criticized political party and NGO laws.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.voacambodia.com/a/eu-trade-sanction-against-cambodia-s-crackdown-enters-into-force-/5541730.html", "site_name": "VOA", "image": {"identifier": "https://gdb.voanews.com/6A6B6167-D300-4218-A3E5-7A78BFDD8952_w1200_r1.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/voakhmer"}, "fb": {"app_id": 347200748704173}, "Author": "VOA Khmer", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@voakhmer", "image": "https://gdb.voanews.com/6A6B6167-D300-4218-A3E5-7A78BFDD8952_w1200_r1.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/Content/responsive/VOA/img/webApp/ico-144x144.png"}}}
