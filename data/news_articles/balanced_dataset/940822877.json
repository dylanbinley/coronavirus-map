British and European Union negotiators called on their political leaders to break the deadlocked negotiations over the two sides\u2019 future relationship amid signs patience is wearing thin.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The European Union signaled it\u2019s ready to impose sanctions on Belarus over the regime\u2019s violent crackdown of protesters after Sunday\u2019s presidential election, which the bloc said was fraudulent.\n\nIn an emergency conference call on Friday, the EU\u2019s 27 foreign ministers agreed to ask the bloc to start drawing up a list of officials linked to President Alexander Lukashenko who could be sanctioned. The process could take as short as a matter of days.\n\nRead More: Belarus Opposition Leader Re-Emerges to Back General Strike\n\n\u201cEU doesn\u2019t accept election results,\u201d the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said in a statement on Twitter after the call. \u201cWork begins on sanctioning those responsible for violence and falsification.\u201d\n\nThe ministers stopped short of taking a final decision to impose the measures, however. That could come at a scheduled meeting of foreign ministers in Berlin at the end of this month, or possibly later, according to two officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. Any decision has to be taken unanimously.\n\nViolent Crackdown\n\n\u201cMost ministers were inclined to introduce targeted, individual sanctions for those that stood behind falsifying of the election or unjustified use of force,\u201d Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz told reporters while the meeting was ongoing. \u201cThe EU will work out the list.\u201d\n\nThe EU meeting came as protests continued in the former Soviet country after Lukashenko, president for 26 years, claimed to have won the weekend\u2019s poll with an 80% share of the vote. Since then, violence has erupted as riot police have cracked down on demonstrators, with 6,700 people detained. Main opposition challenger Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who claimed to have won the election, fled to neighboring Lithuania.\n\nThe bloc has long tried to push Belarus, which borders three EU countries, toward democracy. Four years ago it lifted sanctions on individuals and companies from the nation, originally imposed in 2004, in an attempt to promote dialog with the Lukashenko regime.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel called for the reimposition of sanctions. In a statement made before Friday\u2019s meeting, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the EU wanted to \u201csignificantly increase the pressure on Belarus,\u201d adding that \u201cthe election result must be reviewed and those responsible for mistreatments of peaceful demonstrators must be sanctioned.\u201d\n\nDisputed Waters\n\nThe EU\u2019s foreign ministers also discussed rising tension in the eastern Mediterranean, where Turkey has launched naval exercises off two Greek islands and announced energy exploration research activity in the area. Both Ankara and Athens claim exclusive economic rights to the waters.\n\nBorrell said there was \u201cfull solidarity\u201d with Greece and Cyprus and called on Turkey for \u201cimmediate deescalation and reengaging in dialog.\u201d\n\nA list of possible sanctions against Turkey is being worked on and will be discussed at the next foreign ministers meeting at the end of August, Greek Foreign Minister Nikolaos Dendias said after the call.\n\n(Adds Borrell statement in third paragraph and details on Turkey)\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "METADATA": {"civicscience": {"jspoll-hostname": "www138.civicscience.com"}, "application-name": "EU Takes Step Toward Imposing Fresh Sanctions on Belarus", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "World News", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "The European Union signaled it\u2019s ready to impose sanctions on Belarus over the regime\u2019s violent crackdown of protesters after Sunday\u2019s presidential election, which the bloc said was fraudulent.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
