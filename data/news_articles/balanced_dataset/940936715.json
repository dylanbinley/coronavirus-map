The recent barbaric attack on Indian soldiers by the Chinese forces. India has always given Pakistan a befitting response, which is the only way to deal with them,\u201d the Punjab CM said and added, \u201cChina also needs to be handled with the same iron hand.\u201d\n\nRecalling the contributions of the millions of Indians to the freedom struggle, CM Singh said Punjabis had always been at the forefront of every battle.\n\n\u201cThe cellular jail in Kaala Paani (Andaman Islands) have the names of tens of hundreds of Punjabis etched in immortality. Even though the I-Day celebrations this year were low-key due to the Covid pandemic, this was the time to remember the sacrifices of all those who had made freedom possible for us. It was also the time to salute the defence forces guarding the nation\u2019s borders from the enemy.\u201d\n\nPaying his tributes to Punjab\u2019s freedom fighters, Captain Amarinder reiterated his government\u2019s commitment to extend all benefits of freedom fighters to their next generations (grandchildren). At the same time, he also saluted the Health Workers and Paramedics who were continuously fighting the invisible Covid enemy, along with the NGOs and religious organisations that have worked tirelessly to provide free food and medicine during the period of lockdown.\n\nThe Punjab CM also acknowledged the great work done by the farmers, who have produced the food that fed the nation during the lockdown period and government officials who are serving the people in these difficult times.\n\nThe chief minister recognised the people of Punjab for their cooperation in observing precautions that were helping in containing the pandemic, the students who had adapted to the online teaching methodology, as well as the teachers who were working day and night to create online content to ensure that the studies of their students do not suffer.\n\nHe also lauded the industrialists who had shown remarkable resilience in recovering from the extreme slowdown caused by the pandemic, and the industrial labour which had placed its faith in the state of Punjab and returned to work with the same dedication as before after the initial panic which forced them to leave for their home towns through the trains arranged by the Punjab government.", "METADATA": {"google-site-verification": "U3xIlrlaetYrU7V1lNSFthKZzBFJ_S6qVzdn_gpMNjc", "keywords": "India China, India China Border, LAC News, India China Standoff, India China Latest News, India China Face Off, India China Border News, India China Border Dispute, Galwan Valley News, China, Pakistan, India, Amarinder Singh, Punjab", "news_keywords": "India China, India China Border, LAC News, India China Standoff, India China Latest News, India China Face Off, India China Border News, India China Border Dispute, Galwan Valley News, China, Pakistan, India, Amarinder Singh, Punjab", "description": "Recalling the contributions of the millions of Indians to the freedom struggle, CM Singh said Punjabis had always been at the forefront of every battle.", "og": {"locale": "en_us", "type": "article", "title": "Punjab CM calls for readiness to combat border threat from Pakistan, China", "description": "Recalling the contributions of the millions of Indians to the freedom struggle, CM Singh said Punjabis had always been at the forefront of every battle.", "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cm-calls-for-readiness-to-combat-border-threat-from-pakistan-china/story-uMqxCA50CTj03fuWZyq9WO.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2020/08/15/Pictures/74th-independence-day-in-mohali_38681718-dee2-11ea-b1b0-f6d177b03796.jpg", "width": 960, "height": 640}, "site_name": "Hindustan Times"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Punjab CM calls for readiness to combat border threat from Pakistan, China", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@httweets", "creator": "@httweets", "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cm-calls-for-readiness-to-combat-border-threat-from-pakistan-china/story-uMqxCA50CTj03fuWZyq9WO.html", "title": "Punjab CM calls for readiness to combat border threat from Pakistan, China - chandigarh - Hindustan Times", "description": "Recalling the contributions of the millions of Indians to the freedom struggle, CM Singh said Punjabis had always been at the forefront of every battle.", "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2020/08/15/Pictures/74th-independence-day-in-mohali_38681718-dee2-11ea-b1b0-f6d177b03796.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-15T16:00:11+05:30", "modified_time": "2020-08-15T16:00:11+05:30"}, "section": "chandigarh", "storyid": "d82ea286-dee1-11ea-b1b0-f6d177b03796", "last-updated": "2020-08-15T16:00:11+05:30", "fb": {"pages": 111445058579, "app_id": 672336366190593, "admins": 100006810078735}, "Last-Modified": "2020-08-15T16:00:11+05:30", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
