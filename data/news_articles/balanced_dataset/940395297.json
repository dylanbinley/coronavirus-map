Ogundipe, from office as Vice-Chancellor of the University with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cThis decision was based on the Council\u2019s investigation of serious acts of wrongdoing, gross misconduct, financial recklessness and abuse of office against Professor Oluwatoyin T. Ogundipe.\u201d\n\nHowever in a quick reaction, the embattled vice-chancellor said in a statement: \u201cThe attention of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) management has been drawn to the \u2018Notice to the General Public on the Removal of the Vice Chancellor, University of Lagos\u2019; dated August 12, 2020 and signed by Oladejo Azeez, Esq, Registrar and Secretary to Council, stating that the current Vice Chancellor, Professor Oluwatoyin T. Ogundipe has been removed from office with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cThis is untrue and a figment of his imagination. Therefore, stakeholders of UNILAG and the general public are advised to disregard this mischievous disinformation about the sitting Vice Chancellor of UNILAG, contained in that notice. Professor Ogundipe still remains UNILAG\u2019s Vice-Chancellor.\u201d\n\nEarlier, The Chairman, University of Lagos chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Dr Dele Ashiru, had said the Governing Council of the institution did not have power to sack the Vice-Chancellor, Prof Toyin Ogundipe, following speculations that the council may take drastic action against the VC during its meeting in Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nAshiru, while reacting to some online reports that the Council would sack Ogundipe, said such reports remained speculative.\n\n\u201cWe are following the development. We are aware that the Council relocated to Abuja to meet. The Council does not have the constitutional powers to sack the Vice-Chancellor. We will react appropriately when things become clear,\u201d he said.\n\nIt would be recalled that Ogundipe and the Council Chairman, Dr. Wale Babalakin, SAN, have been engaged in a runnig battle over the management of the institution and some decisions taken in the process.\n\nTheir disagreement led to the suspension of this year\u2019s convocation ceremony of the university in March. Consequently, ASUU held a Congress where Babalakin was declared unwelcomed on campus.\n\nThe last time the council wanted to hold its meeting on campus, ASUU also fixed a Congress for the same day, prompting the council to postpone its meeting, and later moved it to Abuja where it held on Wednesday.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2018/10/26641cf4-unilag.jpg", "secure_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2018/10/26641cf4-unilag.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "UNILAG Crisis Deepens as Governing Council Sacks VC - THISDAYLIVE", "description": "*Disregard council\u2019s statement, Ogundipe tells public *Council lacks power to remove VC, says ASUU By Sunday Ehigiator The Governing Council of the University of Lagos has announced the removal of Professor Toyin Ogundipe, as the Vice-Chancellor of the University.
