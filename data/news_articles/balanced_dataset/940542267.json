Shahid, whose mother is living with dementia, is supporting the charity which is the only national charity caring for families through dementia specialist Admiral Nurses.\n\nThe GRAMMY-nominated artist joins a growing number of ambassadors for the charity including actors Jim Broadbent, Phyllis Logan, Judy Parfitt and Lorelei King and athlete Adelle Tracey, all of whom have personal experience of dementia in their family.\n\nFollowing on from his starring turn as Jay Gatsby in Dementia UK\u2019s celebri-tea photoshoot earlier in the year, Shahid took part in a new awareness raising film for the charity. The \u2018Lives on Hold\u2019 video explains how life for carers of people living with dementia is similar to living in lockdown for many months, and even years. Shahid appeared alongside Dementia UK ambassadors, supporters, staff and Admiral Nurses themselves to raise awareness of the needs of people with dementia as lockdown eases.\n\nHildo Hayo, Chief Executive and Chief Admiral Nurse at Dementia UK, said, \u201cWe are so pleased that Shahid is joining our growing roster of celebrity ambassadors.\n\n\u201cWith his personal experience of dementia, he will allow us to speak to a younger audience who may be struggling with the effects of dementia on their family.\u201d Talking about his new role, the musician and songwriter said: \u201cI\u2019m so proud to announce that I\u2019m an ambassador of Dementia UK and I hope that I can use my profile to raise awareness of the cause and the charity.\n\n\u201cWith my mum\u2019s ever-changing condition and the pressures this places on the wider family, I understand how beneficial an Admiral Nurse would be.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019m learning about dementia all the time so I\u2019m hoping that the relationship will be mutually beneficial and I\u2019ll be able to find out more from the amazing Admiral Nurses at the charity, so that I can provide my mum with the best care possible. In fact, I have already called Dementia UK\u2019s Helpline which I know will continue to be a vital source of support for me as my mum\u2019s condition develops.\u201d\n\nDementia UK provides specialist dementia support for families through its Admiral Nurse service.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "OMG-Verify-V1": "4389-366acdfc-5224-4c07-bb70-f74d8fbfc2db", "og": {"url": "https://www.asianimage.co.uk/news/18648763.naughty-boy-announced-newest-ambassador-dementia-uk/", "site_name": "Asian Image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.asianimage.co.uk/resources/images/11692516/", "width": 768, "height": 500}, "title": "\u2018Naughty Boy\u2019 Announced as newest ambassador for Dementia UK", "type": "website", "name": "\u2018Naughty Boy\u2019 Announced as newest ambassador for Dementia UK", "description": "Shahid Khan, otherwise known as \u2018Naughty Boy\u2019 has joined Dementia UK as the charity\u2019s latest celebrity ambassador.
