Dianne Feinstein blasted the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cWe launch a series of unknown events that could be very, very dangerous,\u201d said. Feinstein. \u201cI think this is a huge mistake.\u201d\n\nAs this plays out, American courts are handling another lawsuit, this one from a Chinese company. Build Your Dreams (BYD), which bagged a $1 billion mask deal with California, is suing VICE Media for a story charging that BYD has \u201ca history of supplying allegedly faulty products to the U.S., ties to the Chinese military and Communist Party, and possible links to forced labor.\u201d\n\nAs Aaron Keller of Law & Crime notes, China\u2019s Uighur Muslim minority allegedly performs forced labor for BYD. The company claims the story is false and seeks $75,000 in damages and \u201cpermanent injunctive relief enjoining VICE Media from continuing to publish or republish the statements adjudicated to be defamatory.\u201d\n\nFeinstein did not say if the BYD lawsuit was a mistake and possibly dangerous. On the other hand, she did not hesitate to praise the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cWhere I live, we hold China as a potential trading partner,\u201d Feinstein said in the hearing. \u201cAs a country that has pulled tens of millions of people out of poverty in a short period of time. And as a country growing into a respectable nation among other nations. And I deeply believe that. I\u2019ve been to China a number of times. I\u2019ve studied the issues.\u201d\n\nThat is indeed the case. During a 2006 visit to China, Feinstein told James Areddy of the Wall Street Journal that she had been coming to China for 31 years, \u201cso I\u2019m not a newcomer.\u201d The former San Francisco mayor described former premier Zhu Rongji as \u201ca good friend.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s also the case that Feinstein\u2019s husband, Richard Blum, has \u201cprofited handsomely from the greatly expanded China trade she supported,\u201d Ben Weingarten noted in the Federalist in 2018. And as the San Francisco Chronicle reported, a longtime spy on Feinstein\u2019s staff even attended Chinese Consulate functions for the senator.\n\nFeinstein promoted Chinese membership in the World Trade Organization. That action removed the annual congressional review of China\u2019s record on human rights and weapons proliferation. Feinstein has not documented any improvements in China\u2019s human-rights record, and she has remained rather quiet about pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong.\n\nThis year, for the first time in three decades, the Chinese government banned demonstrations in Hong Kong recalling the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. \u201cEven lighting a candle seems to be a defying act,\u201d Hong Kong pro-democracy leader Lee Cheuk-yan told CBS News. \u201cWe have the right to believe in democracy and freedom.\u201d\n\nFeinstein is not on record saying that the crackdown could be \u201ca huge mistake,\u201d but in the senator\u2019s view the Missouri lawsuit could be \u201cvery very dangerous.\u201d She has studied the issues and deeply believes that a predatory communist dictatorship is a respectable nation. If people in Hong Kong found that very strange, it would be hard to blame them.\n\nMeanwhile, at this writing the Missouri and BYD lawsuits remain unresolved.\n\nLloyd Billingsley is a policy fellow at the Independent Institute.\n\nFlickr", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"title": "Feinstein\u2019s Courtship of Communist China", "image": "https://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2020-08/222908.png", "url": "https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2020/08/feinsteins_courtship_of_communist_china.html", "description": "In April, with the pandemic raging, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt filed a lawsuit charging that Chinese communist officials are \u201cresponsible for the enormous death, suffering, and economic losses they inflicted on the world, including ...", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2020-08/222908.png", "site": "@AmericanThinker", "card": "In April, with the pandemic raging, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt filed a lawsuit charging that Chinese communist officials are \u201cresponsible for the enormous death, suffering, and economic losses they inflicted on the world, including ...", "description": "In April, with the pandemic raging, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt filed a lawsuit charging that Chinese communist officials are \u201cresponsible for the enormous death, suffering, and economic losses they inflicted on the world, including ..."}, "fb": {"app_id": 1006646233035842}, "photoCredit": "Unk", "photoCreditURL": "Flickr"}}}
