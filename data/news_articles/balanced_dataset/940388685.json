For example, many islands require travelers to bring negative coronavirus test or undergo a mandatory quarantine.\n\nTravelers should research the destination beforehand since rules and regulations are constantly changing.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends avoiding all nonessential international travel during this time. If you decide to travel, follow the CDC\u2019s recommendations in its Global COVID-19 Pandemic Notice.\n\nUPDATE: August 12, 2020: This story was originally published on July 29 and was updated on August 12 to reflect Belize\u2019s postponement for international travel, which has been delayed indefinitely, according to Belizing.\n\nVisit Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nFrom tropical rainforests to pink-sand beaches, the hundreds of islands across the Caribbean entice millions of tourists every year.\n\nThat was all put on pause in March when countries and territories closed their borders and waved goodbye to the final tourists leaving their islands.\n\nFor the next few months, local governments debated and planned how to reopen borders safely for incoming travelers \u2013 and many have struggled to find a balance between the health of their residents and keeping their tourism economies afloat.\n\nSome islands have already begun welcoming tourists back, often requiring them to bring negative COVID-19 tests, complete health scans, and even quarantine.\n\nHere are the destinations across the Caribbean that are open to US travelers.\n\nInternational visitors are welcome to hop between the islands of Antigua and Barbuda.\n\nFoto: St. Johns, the capital of the island nation.

At the end of the quarantine, they\u2019ll take another coronavirus test, according to The Office of the Prime Minister.\n\nMany of the islands\u2019 attractions and businesses will remain closed.

However, Lucien Echavarria, director at the Ministry of Tourism of the Dominican Republic, previously told the Caribbean Journal that all airports would open on July 1 and about half of the island\u2019s hotels would reopen.

They\u2019ll also need to complete a health declaration form and download a tracing app, according to the Grenada Tourism Authority.\n\nIn addition to bringing a negative test, visitors will also be required to take another test within 48 hours of arrival.

Bars, gyms, marinas, theaters, and casinos have all closed again, and beaches are only open for exercising.\n\nIf travelers still need to go to the island, a negative coronavirus test is required upon arrival. Without a prior test, travelers will be required to take one at the airport and enter a 14-day quarantine.
