The United States and the Dominican Republic were the only votes in favour.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember the United States preparing a resolution for months to strike a blow at the Islamic Republic of Iran, and it garners only one vote!,\u201d Rouhani said in a televised speech.\n\n\u201cBut the great success was that the United States was defeated in this conspiracy with humiliation.\u201d\n\nThe UN arms embargo on Iran is due to expire under a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, which provided for many international sanctions against Iran being lifted in exchange for curbs on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. Washington withdrew from the deal in 2018.\n\nThe United States could now follow through on a threat to trigger a return of all UN sanctions on Iran using a provision in the nuclear deal, known as snapback. Diplomats have said the United States could do this as early as next week, but that it would face a tough, messy battle.", "METADATA": {"google-site-verification": "U3xIlrlaetYrU7V1lNSFthKZzBFJ_S6qVzdn_gpMNjc", "keywords": "Iran, US, Iran US ties, Tehran, arms embargo", "news_keywords": "Iran, US, Iran US ties, Tehran, arms embargo", "description": "The UN arms embargo on Iran is due to expire under a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, which provided for many international sanctions against Iran being lifted in exchange for curbs on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme.
