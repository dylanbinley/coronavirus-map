And that opportunity, that fundamental right, is in our ability to exercise our right to vote and to make all of our voices heard.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cOne of my favorite quotes, and one that my husband and I have referred to often, is from Kate Sheppard, a leader in the suffragist movement in New Zealand, who said, \u2018Do not think your single vote does not matter much. The rain that refreshes the parched ground is made up of single drops.\u2019 That is why I vote.\u201d\n\nMeghan\u2019s comments come just one month after court documents revealed she felt \u201cprohibited from defending herself\u201d while she was a senior member of the British royal family.\n\nThe documents were filed as part of her ongoing lawsuit against Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the UK Mail on Sunday, for printing a \u201cprivate and confidential\u201d letter to her estranged father Thomas Markle.\n\nAccording to the court documents, Meghan felt \u201cprohibited from defending herself\u201d after \u201cfalse and damaging\u201d articles were published about her while she was pregnant.\n\nThe documents read: \u201c[Meghan Markle] had become the subject of a large number of false and damaging articles by the U.K. tabloid media, specifically by the [Mail on Sunday], which caused tremendous emotional distress and damage to her mental health.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs her friends had never seen her in this state before, they were rightly concerned for her welfare, specifically as she was pregnant, unprotected by the Institution and prohibited from defending herself.\u201d\n\nMeghan is suing the publishers of the UK Mail on Sunday for printing a \u201cprivate and confidential\u201d letter she sent to her estranged father Thomas Markle in 2018.\n\nMeghan\u2019s father received the letter in August 2018, months before sections of it were published in the UK Mail on Sunday and on the MailOnline in February, 2019.\n\nThe mother-of-one is seeking damages from Associated Newspapers Ltd for alleged misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act.\n\nHowever, Associated Newspapers have defended the letter\u2019s publication by suggesting Meghan put it in the public domain by allegedly telling friends about it \u2013 who later spoke to People magazine.\n\nHowever, the Duchess has insisted she was unaware that five close friends were planning to speak to People magazine about her strained relationship with Thomas, for an article published in February 2019.\n\nThe People magazine article, which was published on February 18, 2019, referred to letters exchanged between Meghan and her father Thomas.\n\nMeghan\u2019s legal battle against the publisher officially kicked off at the end of April as the first High Court hearing took place via video link \u2013 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe virtual High Court hearing was a stepping stone to a potential full trial in early 2021.\n\nDuring the hearing, Meghan\u2019s barrister David Sherborne, who previously acted as Princess Diana\u2019s lawyer, confirmed she\u2019s willing to give evidence in court \u2013 if the case eventually goes to trial.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe defendant [Associated Newspapers] wants to cross-examine her [Meghan] as to whether that belief is reasonable or not \u2013 and they can do that.\u201d\n\nThis means Meghan could come face-to-face with her estranged father, who is reportedly prepared to give evidence against his daughter in court.\n\nThomas Markle previously said he felt pressured to share the letter with the press, after it\u2019s contents were allegedly misrepresented in the People article.\n\nThe 76-year-old told The Mail On Sunday: \u201cI have to defend myself. I only released parts of the letter because other parts were so painful. The letter didn\u2019t seem loving to me. I found it hurtful.\u201d\n\nOn the latest episode of Goss Chats, Goss.ie Founder & CEO Ali Ryan sits down with beauty guru Mark Rogers.\n\nFrom his upcoming wedding to surrogacy plans, Mark opens up about a hectic few months ahead.\n\n#GossChats is sponsored by top Irish aesthetic clinic Haus of JeJuve.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://goss.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/wenn34086524-1024x645.jpg", "secure_url": "https://goss.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/wenn34086524-1024x645.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 645}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Meghan Markle takes another pop at the Royal family by saying she knows 'what it's like to feel voiceless' - Goss.ie", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex stepped down from her role back in March", "url": "https://goss.ie/uk-showbiz/meghan-markle-takes-another-pop-at-the-royal-family-by-saying-she-knows-what-its-like-to-feel-voiceless-219606", "site_name": "Goss.ie", "updated_time": "2020-08-13T08:36:10+01:00"}, "article": {"tag": "Prince Harry", "section": "Royals", "published_time": "2020-08-12T13:29:59+01:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T08:36:10+01:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex stepped down from her role back in March", "title": "Meghan Markle takes another pop at the Royal family by saying she knows 'what it's like to feel voiceless' - Goss.ie", "image": "https://goss.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/wenn34086524.jpg", "creator": "@kendra_becker"}, "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer Website Builder 1.9 - fast and easy to use drag and drop builder for experts and beginners."}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
