Image pictured is 2pm on Friday. Picture: Bureau of Meteorology\n\nmedia_camera A weather radar for Friday afternoon shows heavy storms across the east coast, centred in the north and south. Picture: Bureau of Meteorology\n\nWarnings are also in place in northern NSW, where heavy rain could turn into thunderstorms, and residents in fire-hit areas are warned to be on high alert.\n\n\u201cWhen fires go through, we can see less vegetation (in the area), and that means soil is more likely to be eroded when heavy rainfall comes through,\u201d Ms Imielska said.\n\n\u201cThis can produce more flash flooding, as the rain doesn\u2019t really soak into the landscape, it just runs off.\u201d\n\nMs Imielska said this could be particularly dangerous where hilly or mountainous landscapes were present, or large trees, as their roots were not as embedded as they would be in areas that were not decimated by fire.\n\nIn Sydney, only about 10 millimetres of rainfall is expected but not to the extent of the south coast or northern inland areas \u2013 though meteorologists say this weather system is so intricate, anything could happen.\n\nNSW State Emergency Service assistant commissioner Greg Lynch said crews were preparing communities for evacuations.\n\n\u201cWe have additional flood resources prepared and ready to go, to the south coast in particular, and we\u2019ve also been looking at having other out of area support from our partner emergency services,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Lynch said the SES had called in helicopters in the Bega Valley and into the Moruya area.\n\n\u201cHelicopters will support us with flood rescue or with resupply if the case is that a number of communities or areas within the south coast become isolated,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe State Emergency Service are preparing for evacuations and we are asking communities to prepare for evacuations \u2013 to have their plans ready if the call comes.\u201d\n\nmedia_camera The low-pressure system moving across Queensland and NSW. Picture: Bureau of Meteorology\n\nMr Lynch said anyone living in these areas should clear their backyards and try to avoid leaving their homes.\n\n\u201cUnless you have to go out, please stay at home,\u201d he said.\n\nReflecting on similar storms seen about two weeks ago, the SES boss issued a strong call for people to exercise common sense as the storms thundered in.\n\n\u201cPeople need to take responsibility, they need to ensure they listen to the messaging we\u2019re providing them and that message is clearly, do not drive, walk, or ride through flood waters,\u201d Mr Lynch said.\n\n\u201cI think on our last occasion we rescued more than 30 people from flood waters. That\u2019s putting themselves at risk, and also putting those who have to go and rescue him at risk.\u201d\n\nRainfall will increase over southwest #Queensland overnight, and then spread across the southern inland on Friday. Severe thunderstorms are also possible.

Moderate to heavy rainfall is possible in the far south of the Maranoa and Warrego district.\n\nDaytime maximum temperatures will be below average in the west, near average for central and eastern parts. Mostly light winds over the northern tropics, moderate to fresh northeast to north-westerly winds over the south.\n\nOriginally published as Weather system \u2018half size of NSW\u2019 to hit", "METADATA": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "referrer": "origin", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/couriermail/ms-icon-70x70.png", "msapplication-square144x144logo": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/couriermail/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/couriermail/ms-icon-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/couriermail/ms-icon-310x310.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/couriermail/ms-icon-144x144.png", "robots": "noarchive", "description": "A massive weather system has begun to move in, with some communities preparing for evacuations and others being urged to stay at home.", "keywords": "weather system, heavy rainfall, south coast, emergency services, rain areas, massive weather system, torrential rain wreaks, Daytime maximum temperatures, rain wreaks havocUp, Rain gauges, rainfall accumulations, pressure system, Storm warning, means soil, area support, flood resources, trough system, incident manager, partner emergency services, fire-hit areas, central highlands, northern inland areas, Bega Valley, New South Wales, Australia, Australia and New Zealand, Oceania, Gold Coast, Queensland, Sydney, Moruya, Greg Lynch, Steve Howard, Hannah Moore, Dean Narramore, Agata Imielska", "generator": "tcog", "articleid": "26865c4209b198d06b0a227e150387a2", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-07T22:27:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2020-08-07T22:27:28.000Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@couriermail", "title": "Weather system \u2018half size of NSW\u2019 to hit", "description": "A massive storm is moving in on inland NSW, with major warnings in place for parts of the south coast and Snowy Mountains in what is set to be a weekend of chaos.", "image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cd311e122dbd654629aeb63253c78820"}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Weather system \u2018half size of NSW\u2019 to hit", "description": "A massive storm is moving in on inland NSW, with major warnings in place for parts of the south coast and Snowy Mountains in what is set to be a weekend of chaos.", "url": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/technology/inland-storms-to-dump-month-of-rain-in-a-day-bureau-forecasts/news-story/26865c4209b198d06b0a227e150387a2", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cd311e122dbd654629aeb63253c78820", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "vr": {"canonical": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/technology/inland-storms-to-dump-month-of-rain-in-a-day-bureau-forecasts/news-story/26865c4209b198d06b0a227e150387a2"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
