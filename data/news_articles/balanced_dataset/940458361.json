The proposal aims to preclude students with low progression rates and academic performance from accessing Commonwealth supported places, HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP.\n\nThe release defines such students as those who have failed fifty per cent or more of 8 or more units in a Bachelor\u2019s degree. This equates to one full-time semester\u2019s worth of subjects at the University of Sydney.\n\nStudents who fall under this categorisation must then make an application to their education provider, demonstrating any adverse circumstances suffered.\n\nThe proposal does not suggest any further options or financial support for students whose application is not successful, other than transferring to a different course. Low completion rates will not carry over to new enrolments.\n\nAny debt incurred under an initial degree will be immediately payable, in addition to any HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP support received for subsequent enrolments.\n\n\u201cThough the government claims to be targeting \u2018serial failers\u2019, these attacks will intentionally deny education to precarious students, sacrificing them as collateral if they cannot afford to self-fund their education,\u201d SRC President Liam Donohoe told Honi Soit.\n\n\u201cMany of these vulnerable students are in first-year. It is this group, who are least aware of the help they could get and least able to reach out for diagnoses, who are unlikely to have the documentation needed to succeed in appeals.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, the overwhelming majority of students hurt by these changes are not \u2018serial failers\u2019, but hardworking, sincere students dealing with serious issues outside their control.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe measures announced by the Morrison government are the latest in their war on students. During the biggest social and economic crisis in a lifetime, the government wants to punish students who aren\u2019t getting the right support to do their studies,\u201d SRC Education Officer Jack Mansell told Honi.\n\n\u201cInstead, we need funding to address student poverty, resources to assist students in their studies, and free education for all. Any move towards a performance-based funding model is a dangerous step towards a fully individualised market system, and up front fees.\u201d\n\nThe change is part of the larger \u2018Job-ready Graduates\u2019 legislation package announced earlier in June, which included controversial fee hikes to humanities and communications degrees by over 100 percent.\n\nA nationwide student action to protest the aforementioned changes is taking place on August 28. Details for the Sydney event can be found here.\n\n", "METADATA": {"fb": {"pages": 237780931045}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "description": "A new proposal by the Morrison Government to overhaul higher education fee support was unveiled in a media release from Minister of Education Dan Tehan this\u2026", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "http://honisoit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/f26102b9fb57b83bdccb12af2bdc2f15032ba766.jpeg", "width": 800, "height": 450}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "New government proposal precludes low-performing students from accessing HECS support - Honi Soit", "description": "A new proposal by the Morrison Government to overhaul higher education fee support was unveiled in a media release from Minister of Education Dan Tehan this morning.
