Try refreshing your browser, or French PM likens killing of French aid workers in Niger to 2015 Paris attacks Back to video\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very likely the same hatred, the same cowardice, the same inhumanity that was at work in Niger and at the Bataclan,\u201d Castex said in front of the repatriated coffins of the six at Paris\u2019s Orly airport. The Bataclan was the concert venue where 90 people were killed in one of the coordinated attacks by Islamist militants in the French capital in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t yet been able to put a name to the organization behind this heinous crime\u201d in Niger, he said, adding that it had \u201call the appearances of a terrorist attack.\u201d\n\nThe aid workers were driving through a giraffe reserve, a popular destination for expatriates 65 km (40 miles) from Niger\u2019s capital Niamey in an area considered safe by the government.\n\nNo one immediately claimed responsibility for the assault. But France and other countries have warned people against traveling to parts of Niger where militants including Boko Haram and an affiliate of Islamic State operate.\n\nFrance\u2019s counter-terrorism prosecutor has opened a murder investigation in the case.
