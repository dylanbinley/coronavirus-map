But it comes as scientists say that the need to rein in methane leaks at fossil fuel wells nationwide has become far more urgent, and new studies indicate that the scale of methane pollution could be driving the planet toward a climate crisis faster than expected.\n\nAndrew Wheeler, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, announced at an event in Pittsburgh on Thursday that he had completed the legal process of lifting the methane regulation. He was speaking in a city at the heart of the nation\u2019s natural-gas boom, and in a state that will be critical to winning this fall\u2019s presidential election.\n\n\u201cE.P.A. has been working hard to fulfill President Trump\u2019s promise to cut burdensome and ineffective regulations for our domestic energy industry,\u201d he said. \u201cRegulatory burdens put into place by the Obama-Biden administration fell heavily on small and medium-sized energy businesses.\u201d", "METADATA": {"article": {"published": "2020-08-13T20:02:25.000Z", "modified": "2020-08-13T21:00:17.000Z", "section": "Climate", "tag": "Obama, Barack", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000007286469, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/be8b2c46-f76a-5433-b39e-98ccce618e69", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/14191bad1eb8447eafa62d9260067174", "description": "The weakening of Obama-era efforts to fight climate change amounts to a gift to many oil companies.
