I\u2019m committed to it. That hasn\u2019t changed.\n\n\u201cI remind you that I was the one who put the issue of sovereignty over Judea and Samaria on the table. This issue remains on the table,\u201d he said.\n\nThe UAE and Israel will both join the US to launch a \u201cstrategic agenda for the Middle East,\u201d with the three leaders insisting that they \u201cshare a similar outlook regarding the threats and opportunities in the region.\u201d\n\nPalestinian official Hanan Ashrawi said that the UAE had \u201ccome out in the open on its secret dealings/normalisation with Israel\u201d and warned: \u201cMay you never be sold out by your \u2018friends\u2019.\u201d", "METADATA": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Star", "type": "article", "title": "Palestinian leadership demands UAE immediately withdraws from 'shameful' deal with Israel", "url": "https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/palestinian-leadership-demands-uae-immediately-withdraws-shameful-deal-israel", "updated_time": "2020-08-15T11:08:43+01:00", "image": "https://morningstaronline.co.uk/sites/all/themes/custom/morningstar_online/morning-star-default.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "url": "https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/palestinian-leadership-demands-uae-immediately-withdraws-shameful-deal-israel", "title": "Palestinian leadership demands UAE immediately withdraws from", "image": "https://morningstaronline.co.uk/sites/default/files/AP20227458007542.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T14:32:09+01:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-15T11:08:43+01:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}}}
