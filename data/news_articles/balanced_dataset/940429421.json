Picture: AAP Image/Darren England\n\nDuring a bail variation hearing in the Brisbane Supreme Court this morning, Crown prosecutor Rowan Micairan argued that the 64-year-old should be banned from social media altogether while on bail.\n\nHe said the day his bail application was heard Mr O'Dea posted on Facebook that he had to go to court so the \"pedo pricks leave the GPS ankle bracelet off\".\n\nMr Micairan said his \"prolific\" posts had scorned the court and Mr O'Dea had also shared posts that had accused judges of protecting paedophiles and Federal Police officers of perverting the course of justice.\n\n\"He cannot be trusted on social media \u2026 he just cannot,\" Mr Micairan said.\n\nMr Micairan also argued that O'Dea, who has been on bail for two years, should be made to wear the GPS tracker again and should continue to report seven days a week because he still holds \"animosity\" towards a man he allegedly stalked.\n\nThree months before he was charged with conspiracy to defeat justice and child stealing, Mr O'Dea allegedly stalked the father of one of the children he is accused of abducting by driving 300km to stake out his Brisbane home and threatened to \"put him in hospital\".\n\nLawyer Andrew Owens said since his arrest, Mr O'Dea and had made no attempt to contact the father and had complied fully with his strict bail conditions, which included reporting seven days a week for the past eight months.\n\nMr Owens said Mr O'Dea had strong ties to the Grafton community so would not be a flight risk and the COVID-19 border restrictions would make it difficult for him to travel to Queensland anyway.\n\nThe court was told he had reported more than 200 times since December.\n\n\"We get armed robbers and alleged murderers who don't have to report that often,\" Justice Peter Applegarth said.\n\nJustice Applegarth removed the condition requiring O'Dea to wear a GPS tracker and reduced the number of days he had to report to four times a week.\n\nBut he was reluctant to place a blanket ban on his social media usage.\n\n\"Let's be realistic here,\" Justice Applegarth said.\n\n\"If he supports the Sydney Swans, he couldn't go on the Sydney Swans Facebook page and say 'go the Swannies' if the Commonwealth had its way. Is this real?\" he said.\n\nMr Owen and Mr Micairan were left to strike a compromise about how to best manage Mr O'Dea's social media use.\n\nJustice Applegarth said he would likely make an order on that condition by tomorrow.\n\nOriginally published as 'W--kers': Accused child abductor's spray on Facebook", "METADATA": {"description": "A man accused of being part of a child abduction syndicate let fly on Facebook calling supreme court officials \u201cw--kers\u201d and \u201cpedo pricks\u201d a court has heard.", "author": "Danielle Buckley", "keywords": "accused-child-abductor, child-stealing, court, crime, editors-picks", "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"app_id": 140341272658072, "pages": 24945426253}, "og": {"site_name": "Northern Star", "title": "\u2018W--kers\u2019: Accused child abductor\u2019s spray on Facebook", "description": "A man accused of being part of a child abduction syndicate let fly on Facebook calling supreme court officials \u201cw--kers\u201d and \u201cpedo pricks\u201d a court has heard.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2020/08/13/v3imagesbinf6bfaea9c3d55383fdaf8d4487c5073b-ddazamkg6593fdg6uu2_ct1880x930.jpg", "width": 1880, "height": 930}, "url": "https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/w-kers-accused-child-abductos-spray-on-facebook/4077507/"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047076701, app-argument=northernstar://article?aid=4077507&type=article", "al": {"ios": {"url": "northernstar://article?aid=4077507&type=article", "app_store_id": 1047076701, "app_name": "Northern Star"}, "android": {"url": "northernstar://article?aid=4077507&type=article", "app_name": "Northern Star", "package": "com.apnarm.northernstar"}, "web": {"url": "https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/w-kers-accused-child-abductos-spray-on-facebook/4077507/"}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@northern_star_", "title": "\u2018W--kers\u2019: Accused child abductor\u2019s spray on Facebook", "description": "A man accused of being part of a child abduction syndicate let fly on Facebook calling supreme court officials \u201cw--kers\u201d and \u201cpedo pricks\u201d a court has heard.", "image": "https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2020/08/13/v3imagesbinf6bfaea9c3d55383fdaf8d4487c5073b-ddazamkg6593fdg6uu2_ct300x300.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=1020", "capi-id": "e1f4ae86a7fba90faea16923379a4888", "article": {"content_tier": "locked"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
