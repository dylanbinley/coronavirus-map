He further added that some of the petitioners are those who are purported complainants but not choose to follow the procedure in law.\n\nHe also apprised the court that Delhi Police has already filed chargesheet in the matter and said that action was taken pursuant to the violence but this part was missing in these petitions. Thereafter, ASG Lekhi sought to adjourn the matter on the ground that he wants to place NHRC report on record.\n\nThe court adjourned the matter for further hearing on August 21.\n\nThe court was hearing a batch of the petition including one filed by lawyer Nabila Hasan through advocates Sneha Mukherjee and Siddharth Seem seeking action against cops over Jamia violence. The petitioners had blamed the forces for using extreme, ruthless and excessive physical force and violence against unarmed and peaceful students.\n\nThe plea also raised questions over the use of \"extreme\" measures such as tear gas shells, chilli-based explosives and rubber bullets against the protesters.\n\nSeveral protesters and policemen sustained injuries during a protest against the new citizenship law near the Jamia Millia Islamia University campus on December 15. Some public transports were set on fire and other public properties were also damaged in the protest.\n\nOn December 15 last year, the Delhi Police had thrown teargas shells inside campus, allegedly barged into the premises and allegedly dragged students out of the library before assaulting them.
