It had committed a further R420 million then.\n\nHowever, most of the mineworkers still live in squalor at the nearby Nkaneng informal settlement.\n\nJUSTICE FOR MASSACRE VICTIMS\n\nThe Socio-Economic Rights Institute (Seri) has called for justice for the victims of the Marikana massacre and their families, saying that the state should put more effort into holding those responsible to account.\n\nHowever, this is unlikely to happen anytime soon, with many police investigations, which were meant to be carried out to collect evidence of the murders, stillborn.\n\nSeri has argued that poor leadership and weak levels of police accountability persist despite the lessons presented by the Marikana massacre.\n\nA total of 44 people died during the unrest at Lonmin\u2019s Marikana mine.\n\nTen died in the preceding week, including two police officers and two security guards, while 34 mineworkers were gunned down by the police during the strike for wage increases.\n\nYet, eight years later, the murders of Mgcineni Noki, Molefi Ntsoele, Fezile Saphendu, Jackson Lehura, Henry Pato and others remain unsolved.\n\nSeri\u2019s senior attorney Zamatungwa Khumalo: \"While the families of the mineworkers continue to wait for justice, exessive use of force and brutality by the police still persists. Locally, during the COVID-19 national lockdown, SOuth Africa witnessed heavy-handed law enforcement by various law enforcement bodies.\"\n\nSince 2012, only nine police officers have been prosecuted for the deaths of three striking mineworkers and two police officers.\n\nDownload the EWN app to your iOS or Android device.", "METADATA": {"shorturl": "https://ewn.co.za/eyw7p", "description": "The Socio-Economic Rights Institute (Seri) has argued that poor leadership and weak levels of police accountability persist despite the lessons presented by the Marikana massacre.", "keywords": "IPID, Lonmin, Farlam Commission of Inquiry, Marikana massacre, Socio-Economic Rights Institute (Seri), Local", "news_keywords": "IPID, Lonmin, Farlam Commission of Inquiry, Marikana massacre, Socio-Economic Rights Institute (Seri), Local", "author": "Theto Mahlakoana", "ContentItemType": "Article", "articleid": 393077, "disqusidentifier": "33F96EEF-DD88-4671-8BCC-50BE0D095212", "og": {"type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/kvyjlml9qhs9rlxdlevc", "secure_url": "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/kvyjlml9qhs9rlxdlevc", "width": 700, "height": 437}, "url": "https://ewn.co.za/2020/08/14/8-years-on-justice-for-marikana-massacre-victims-remains-elusive", "title": "8 years on, justice for Marikana massacre victims remains elusive", "description": "The Socio-Economic Rights Institute (Seri) has argued that poor leadership and weak levels of police accountability persist despite the lessons presented by the Marikana massacre."}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/kvyjlml9qhs9rlxdlevc", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ewnreporter", "url": "https://ewn.co.za/2020/08/14/8-years-on-justice-for-marikana-massacre-victims-remains-elusive", "site": "@ewnreporter", "title": "8 years on, justice for Marikana massacre victims remains elusive", "description": "The Socio-Economic Rights Institute (Seri) has argued that poor leadership and weak levels of police accountability persist despite the lessons presented by the Marikana massacre.", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "Eyewitness News", "ipad": "Eyewitness News", "googleplay": "Eyewitness News"}, "id": {"iphone": 636459947, "ipad": 636459947, "googleplay": "com.eyewitnessnews"}}}, "fb": {"app_id": 259652954116494, "pages": 168892509821961}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=636459947", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.eyewitnessnews", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "p": {"domain_verify": "3acf0ffe30e8e741add34eeb0aa173dd"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
