Nigerian doctor\u2019s claim is misleading", "TEXT": "Experts said communicable diseases, caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi, could spread hand-to-hand, but no data suggested 80% were.\n\nWhile Aproko Doctor tweeted that 80% of \u201call diseases in the world\u201d were transmitted by hand, he told Africa Check he meant \u201cinfectious\u201d, or communicable, diseases.\n\nExplainer: Experts say no evidence currently supports the claim that 80% of all diseases are transmitted \u201cby hand\u201d.\n\nOver 80% of all diseases in the world are transmitted by hand.\n\nAre the majority of diseases in the world transmitted \u201cby hand\u201d, as a Twitter user in Nigeria has claimed?\n\nFidelis Egemba, popularly known as \u201cAproko Doctor\u201d on the platform, tweeted to his more than 500,000 followers that \u201cover 80% of all diseases in the world are transmitted by hands\u201d.\n\nThe 7 July 2020 tweet attracted more than 1,200 likes and comments. Egemba, a qualified medical doctor, urged his audience to wash their hands and sanitise with 2sure, a hand sanitiser brand recently launched in Nigeria.\n\nWhen asked for evidence, Egemba told Africa Check he was referring only to \u201cinfectious diseases\u201d and not all diseases. He termed the claim \u201can error in dissemination\u201d.\n\nAs of 6 August 2020, he had not made any correction on Twitter. But are nearly all diseases in the world transmitted by hand? We checked.\n\nDiseases, defined\n\nThe World Health Organization, or WHO, in its advice on how to prevent the spread of Covid-19, suggests people wash their hands with soap and water or clean them with an alcohol-based hand rub. The health agency has not endorsed any particular brand of soap or hand sanitiser.\n\nA disease is any harmful deviation from the normal structural or functional state of an organism. It is generally associated with certain signs and symptoms and is different from physical injury.\n\nDiseases can be communicable or noncommunicable, according to the WHO.\n\nCommunicable, or infectious, diseases are caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi. These can be spread directly or indirectly from one person to another, through a number of ways:\n\nIngesting contaminated food or water\n\nInsect bites or contact with infected animals\n\nContact with contaminated body fluids or faeces\n\nDirect contact with infected blood\n\nSexual transmission\n\nNoncommunicable diseases are also known as chronic diseases. They are not passed from person to person and include cancers, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The WHO identifies them as the leading cause of death globally. (Note: In Africa and other low-income regions, communicable diseases are the leading cause of death.)\n\nUnclear share of communicable diseases transmitted by hand\n\nA variety of disease-producing bacteria and viruses are carried in the mouth, nose, throat and respiratory tract. Diseases such as leprosy and tuberculosis (TB) and some influenza infections can be spread by coughing, sneezing, and saliva or mucus on \u201cunwashed hands\u201d.\n\nWe therefore asked experts if Aproko Doctor\u2019s claim could be accurate. They variously described the claim as misleading, exaggerated or outright incorrect.\n\nThe WHO told Africa Check it did not have information showing the share of communicable diseases transmitted by hand or touch. \u201cThe WHO doesn\u2019t have this kind of data,\u201d said spokesperson Audrei Muchnik.\n\nThe claim is misleading according to Dr Mary Stephen, a technical officer for the agency\u2019s Africa unit. While most infectious diseases are transmitted from person to person or by feco-oral transmission, the hand \u201cis not the only way diseases are transmitted\u201d, Stephen said.\n\n\u201cIt is better to say infectious diseases are commonly transmitted from person to person through direct contact, droplets or contact with contaminated fomites [inanimate objects], surfaces or objects,\u201d she said.\n\nMost-widespread diseases not transmitted hand-to-hand\n\nThe claim does not appear to be \u201cwholly correct\u201d, Prof Nasia Safdar told Africa Check. She is a faculty member at the infectious disease division of the University of Wisconsin\u2019s department of medicine in the US.\n\n\u201cA large proportion, but not all, of communicable diseases are transmitted through the hands or contact, but the big ones worldwide such as malaria and TB are not,\u201d Safdar said.\n\nThe claim is incorrect, Prof Tanimola Akande, from the epidemiology and community health unit at the University of Ilorin in western Nigeria,said.\n\nOf the major diseases, only a few such as gastroenteritis or diarrhoea are transmitted by hand, Akande said.\n\n\u201cThe claim may be referring to diarrhoeal diseases. Food and water-borne diseases are not necessarily transmitted by hands. Malaria, which is one of the most common diseases in the tropics, is not transmitted by hand,\u201d Akande said.\n\nConclusion: No evidence 80% of diseases transmitted by hand\n\nWhile promoting a new brand of hand sanitiser, Fidelis Egemba, known as Aproko Doctor on Twitter, told his 500,000 followers that \u201cover 80% of all diseases in the world are transmitted by hands\u201d.\n\nEgemba told Africa Check he meant infectious diseases only. However, a number of experts said there was no evidence that supported such a share, whether of infectious or non-infectious diseases.\n\nWe rate the claim as misleading.\n\nFurther reading:\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Africa Check 2020.
