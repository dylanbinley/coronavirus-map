THE CANADIAN PRESS/Paul Chiasson\n\nIt\u2019s normal for kids to get back-to-school butterflies as the bell ring draws near. But on top of the familiar concerns about fitting in and getting good grades, kids need to deal with a new set of stresses this fall as they head back to class in the thick of a pandemic.\n\nFrom the social pressures of being sorted into class cohorts to fears about bringing the novel coronavirus back home, experts say returning to school will likely provoke some anxiety for students of all ages.\n\nFor advice on how to help children cope, The Canadian Press spoke to Ashley Miller, a child psychiatrist at BC Children\u2019s Hospital, and Nikki Martyn, program head of early childhood studies at University of Guelph-Humber.\n\nStick to the program\n\nAfter months of learning at home away from their friends, school might seem like a scary place for many kids afraid of catching the virus or infecting their relatives, Miller said.\n\nHowever, a child\u2019s distress can\u2019t dictate the family plan.\n\nShe said parents can try to alleviate their children\u2019s concerns by assuring them that there\u2019s a plan in place to keep them safe, and their participation is a crucial part of it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of ways we can get kids involved, and they have a bit more of a sense of control.\u201d\n\nShe suggested parents help their children get a head start over the summer by practising how to catch up with classmates from a two-metre distance, or picking out a mask that will make them the envy of all their friends.\n\nMartyn said such preparation will also help children settle into their new COVID-19 school schedule.\n\n\u201cChildren really love and thrive on a routine,\u201d Martyn said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that when school starts again, we set up routines \u2026 to help provide structure for your child and try to reduce stress.\u201d\n\nRecognize the symptoms of stress\n\nMartyn said parents should keep an eye out for changes in mood and behaviour that may suggest their children are suffering from undue stress.\n\nSigns can include excessive handwashing, self-soothing habits such as thumb sucking and uncharacteristic emotional outbursts, she said.\n\nIn some cases, it may be appropriate to seek help from a family doctor or mental health professional, Martyn said.\n\nStay in school, kids\n\nMiller expects many kids will come up with creative ways to get out of class come September, a problem that\u2019s known as school avoidance.\n\nYoung children may complain of phantom maladies as an excuse to skip school. It\u2019s important to acknowledge these ailments as real, even if they\u2019re emotionally rooted, she said. But once you\u2019ve ruled out COVID-19, the goal should be to lead kids back to the classroom.\n\nThis may prove to be a greater challenge for young adults who can protest \u201cwith their feet,\u201d Miller said. It may be useful to remind teenagers of the reasons why they\u2019d want to be at school with their friends rather than staying home under parental supervision.\n\nMaking the grade during COVID-19\n\nResearch suggests that heightened anxiety can interfere with academic performance, Miller said, so getting straight As shouldn\u2019t be the focus for kids this semester.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s going have to be on board for taking care of the kids\u2019 emotional well-being so that learning can get underway.\u201d\n\nShe said that means school curricula will have to take a back seat to the more important lessons of trusting teachers and following safety protocols.\n\nIf parents notice a dip in their children\u2019s report cards, Miller urged them to remember that a negative COVID-19 test is the most important measure of success.\n\nThe kids will be all right, but parents and teachers need to be too\n\nChange is always hard, Miller said, but people of all ages are adaptable, and in many ways, kids are more so than anyone else.\n\nShe noted that kids take emotional cues from the adults around them, so it\u2019s important that parents and teachers project confidence in public health leadership, even if they harbour private reservations.\n\nFor better or worse, we\u2019re all in this together, Martyn said, so everyone has a role to play in looking out for children\u2019s best interests.\n\n\u201cThe nice thing would be if we go in with openness and understanding and try our best, recognizing that we\u2019re all going to fail a little bit and we\u2019re all going to learn a little bit in the end.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no \u2018right\u2019 answer\n\nMiller recognizes that parents face a difficult choice in weighing the anxieties of returning to school against the emotional strain and social isolation of home-schooling.\n\nThose decisions should be guided by the advice of public health officials, the prevalence of the virus in the community, the family\u2019s risk factors and the child\u2019s individual needs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no perfect answer for everybody,\u201d Miller said, noting medical professionals can offer advice to help figure out what\u2019s best for your family.\n\nIt\u2019s OK to not be OK\n\nMartyn said one of the most important things parents can do to help their children cope with back-to-school stress is assure them that their feelings are normal, and even share some of their own.\n\n\u201cThe kids need to know that it\u2019s OK to not be OK,\u201d she said. \u201c(They need to) know that they\u2019re not alone, and they can count on you and you\u2019ll always be there for them.\u201d\n\nShe said the key is to support them through their struggles so they can make it to the other side stronger than before.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re teaching children the important skill of resilience,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ll learn that they can persevere and get through difficult, stressful circumstances.\u201d\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 14, 2020.\n\nAdina Bresge, The Canadian Press\n\n\n\n\n\n", "METADATA": {"description": "It\u2019s normal for kids to get back-to-school butterflies as the\u00a0bell ring\u00a0draws near.
