They agreed to coordinate closely in addressing regional issues, including on the South China Sea and North Korea, the ministry said.\n\nOn Friday, the Japanese minister will travel to Malaysia for talks with Mohamed Azmin Ali, the country's minister of international trade and industry, and Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein. After returning to Japan, Motegi will then visit Papua New Guinea, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar from Aug 20 to 25.\n\nMotegi visited Britain for four days last week, becoming the first member of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet to travel overseas since the coronavirus was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "METADATA": {"description": "Japan and Singapore agreed Thursday to ease travel restrictions implemented in response to the coronavirus pandemic from September, targeting businesspeople and expatriates, on condition they take measures to prevent infections. &quot;We will just need to confirm small details before the resumption of reciprocal visits,&quot; Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told reporters online\u2026", "og": {"title": "Japan, Singapore to ease COVID-19 travel restrictions from September", "description": "Japan and Singapore agreed Thursday to ease travel restrictions implemented in response to the coronavirus pandemic from September, targeting businesspeople and expatriates, on condition they take measures to prevent infections. &quot;We will just need to confirm small details before the resumption of reciprocal visits,&quot; Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told reporters online\u2026", "url": "https://japantoday.com/category/politics/Japan-Singapore-to-ease-COVID-19-travel-restrictions-from-September", "image": "https://japantoday.com/images/japan-today-social.jpg", "type": "article", "site_name": "Japan Today"}, "twitter": {"title": "Japan, Singapore to ease COVID-19 travel restrictions from September", "description": "Japan and Singapore agreed Thursday to ease travel restrictions implemented in response to the coronavirus pandemic from September, targeting businesspeople and expatriates, on condition they take measures to prevent infections. &quot;We will just need to confirm small details before the resumption of reciprocal visits,&quot; Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told reporters online\u2026", "image": {"src": "https://japantoday.com/images/japan-today-social.jpg"}, "url": "https://japantoday.com/category/politics/Japan-Singapore-to-ease-COVID-19-travel-restrictions-from-September", "site": "summary", "card": "@JapanToday", "domain": "japantoday.com"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 205769802778296}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}}}
