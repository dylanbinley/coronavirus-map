He does not meet the requirements for parole.\n\n\"The security interests of the general public have to be preserved and we are strongly opposing this request for parole. We do not advocate his early release from prison.\"\n\nIt comes just days after Mr Fulscher told The Sun Christian B would not face any trial for Madeleine's disappearance as he did not believe there was any evidence against him despite prosecutors\u2019 claims.\n\nHe challenged investigators to prove their case and insisted they were ''just chasing down a blind alley''.\n\nMr Fulscher added that just because Christian B's phone was logged at the Ocean Club apartments in Portugal's Praia da Luz where Madeleine was taken from in May 2007, didn't mean he was responsible.\n\nA prosecution source in Germany said: \u201cWe are happy that our suspect is the person responsible and are building a case against him.\n\n\u201cWe will not be pushed or challenged by anyone and just want justice to be served.\u201d\n\nPaperwork regarding his appeal has been lodged at the local court in Kiel, where he is currently in prison and a lone judge will decide in the next few weeks whether he should be released early.\n\nBut officials are confident he will remain in prison as he is also serving a seven year sentence for the rape of a 72 year old American woman at Praia da Luz in 2005.\n\nMadeleine was taken and yards from where she was on holiday with her parents Kate and Gerry in 2007.\n\nMost read in News VIRUS HOTSPOTS The 29 towns & cities on PHE's virus watch list at risk of local lockdown POLICE CAMERA NO ACTION Speed camera van crashes into hedge while parking to catch drivers DEADLY TOLL Coronavirus daily death toll falls to 3 as cases rises by 1,012 in 24 hours TIME TO UNLOAD Flytipping victim uses dumper truck to return over 400 tyres to 'culprit' FERRY BAD NEWS Quarantined Brits furious after missing last boats & trains from France MARKLE MY WORDS Meghan attacks 'toxicity' of media & says state of US 'devastating'\n\nHe is appealing the conviction at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg claiming that arrest warrant protocols were not followed when he was extradited from Italy to Germany in 2018.\n\nMs Gropp added: \u201cThe suspect was sentenced to 21 months in October 2011 for the drug trafficking offence and this can be suspended as it was under two years but he then went on to commit further crimes.\n\n\u201cHe was given 15 months in October 2017 for sexual offences against children and this coupled with the rape conviction makes it highly unlikely that he will be given parole.
