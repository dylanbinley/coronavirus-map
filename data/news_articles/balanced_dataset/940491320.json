Under the theme \"My part in building Rwanda and the world\" discussions revolved around how challenges that face youth today can be tackled.\n\nMinister Mbabazi reflected on the First Lady Jeannette Kagame's message that was shared on Twitter encouraging young people to choose discipline over complacency.\n\n\"Dear youth, let nothing be lost upon you. Choose discipline over complacency, for what you make of your world today will be yours tomorrow,\" the First Lady tweeted.\n\nMinister Mbabazi referred to the tweet and reminded Rwandan youth today that discipline and good ideology is what enabled the youth who liberated Rwanda 26 years ago to do what seemed impossible.\n\n\"Leave your comfort zones and bring out good ideas. Be self-disciplined and pay your contribution to building Rwanda, that is how we will add on and sustain today's achievements,\" she said.\n\nStrong enough to face current challenges?\n\nMarc Gwamaka, founder of Walk to Remember, an annual initiative that brings together the youth of Rwanda and beyond to take a stand against Genocide, was among the speakers during the event.\n\nFor him, discipline, commitment and the willingness to learn can enable Rwandan youth face current challenges.\n\nAmong the challenges that were raised by the youth during the event is lack of resources, drug abuse and the ongoing Covid-19 that has halted numerous projects since early this year.\n\nJanvier Karangwa who represented the Rwandan youth living in Angola emphasized Gwamaka's point that with willingness to learn, innovative minds and mentorship, Rwandan youth can overcome challenges posed to them and help the country progress.\n\nInternational Youth Day was established in 2000 with purpose drawing attention a set of cultural and legal issues surrounding youth.
