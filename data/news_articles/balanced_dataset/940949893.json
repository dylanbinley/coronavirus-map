He said it shows the weakness of Cambodian authorities in letting these people continue to commit offences.\n\n\u201cAuthorities in Cambodia seem to be carelessly letting Chinese people live here. This kidnapping happened because there is no management.\n\n\u201cWe also doubt they will be punished. They commit the offences in Cambodia, but they are sent to China for punishment,\u201d he said.", "METADATA": {"twitter": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/topic-3_-29-chinese-nationals-arrested-on-suspicion-of-kidnapping_at-chaktomuk-communce-daun-penh-district_aug-12-2020_by-phnom-penh-gendarmerie-1.jpg", "src": "https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/topic-3_-29-chinese-nationals-arrested-on-suspicion-of-kidnapping_at-chaktomuk-communce-daun-penh-district_aug-12-2020_by-phnom-penh-gendarmerie-1.jpg"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": {"identifier": "@phnompenhpost", "id": 43082514}, "url": "https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/police-arrest-29-chinese-kidnapping-capital", "title": "Police arrest 29 Chinese for kidnapping in capital", "description": "Phnom Penh Military Police arrested 29 Chinese nationals on kidnapping charges on Wednesday."}, "og": {"image": "https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/topic-3_-29-chinese-nationals-arrested-on-suspicion-of-kidnapping_at-chaktomuk-communce-daun-penh-district_aug-12-2020_by-phnom-penh-gendarmerie-1.jpg", "title": "Police arrest 29 Chinese for kidnapping in capital", "description": "Phnom Penh Military Police arrested 29 Chinese nationals on kidnapping charges on Wednesday.", "type": "article"}, "description": "Phnom Penh Military Police arrested 29 Chinese nationals on kidnapping charges on Wednesday.", "revisit-after": "1 week"}}}
