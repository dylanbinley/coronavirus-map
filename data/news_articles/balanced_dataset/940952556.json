Political and diplomatic initiatives have been strengthened to this end,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThe Bangladeshi Foreign Ministry also said in a statement earlier this week that it was pursuing diplomatic routes for the repatriation of the convicts.\n\nMeanwhile, several political and cultural organizations and educational institutions held programs to mark Mujib\u2019s death anniversary.\n\nSpecial prayers and other events to commemorate the founding father\u2019s life and legacy were organized with adherence to the government\u2019s COVID-19 safety guidelines.\n\nThe state-run radio and television channels ran special programs throughout the day, while the Bangladeshi flag also flew at half-mast at government buildings and foreign missions of Bangladesh.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "image": "https://img.piri.net/mnresize/600/-/resim/imagecrop/2020/08/15/03/53/resized_71026-2134_tur_picture_20200317_21021992_21021991.jpg", "description": "Country honors life, legacy of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on 45th death anniversary", "og": {"description": "Country honors life, legacy of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on 45th death anniversary", "image": "https://img.piri.net/mnresize/600/-/resim/imagecrop/2020/08/15/03/53/resized_71026-2134_tur_picture_20200317_21021992_21021991.jpg", "title": "Bangladesh vows retribution for founder's assassination", "site_name": "Yeni \u015eafak"}, "fb": {"pages": 154012084797126}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Bangladesh vows retribution for founder's assassination", "description": "Country honors life, legacy of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on 45th death anniversary", "image": "https://img.piri.net/mnresize/600/-/resim/imagecrop/2020/08/15/03/53/resized_71026-2134_tur_picture_20200317_21021992_21021991.jpg"}, "msvalidate.01": "95F11EB833D9D049C2CDC855116F4442", "robots": "ALL", "Rating": "General", "Distribution": "Global", "Copyright": "Yeni \u015eafak", "Classification": "Consumer", "DC.Title": "Bangladesh vows retribution for founder's assassination", "DC.Creator": "Yeni \u015eafak", "DC.Subject": "Bangladesh vows retribution for founder's assassination", "DC.Description": "Country honors life, legacy of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on 45th death anniversary", "DC.Publisher": "Yeni \u015eafak", "DC.Contributor": "Yeni \u015eafak", "DC.Type": "Text", "DC.Source": "Yeni \u015eafak", "DC.Language": "tr-TR", "cXenseParse": {"pir-main_class": "Detay", "articleid": 3536905, "pageclass": "article", "pir-main_type": "S\u0131cak Haber", "Url": "https://www.yenisafak.com/en/world/bangladesh-vows-retribution-for-founders-assassination-3536905", "pir-pageclass": "Haber", "recs": {"publishtime": "2020-08-15T15:52:30Z"}, "title": "Bangladesh vows retribution for founder's assassination", "author": "Mohamad Birakdar", "pir-main_category": "World", "pir-sub_category": "Asia", "cx_channel": "Site"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2020-08-15T15:53:30Z"}, "google-play-app": "app-id=yenisafak.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=579620956", "yandex-verification": "3dc8392bdb3d93fb", "maincategory": "World", "subcategory": "Asia"}}}
