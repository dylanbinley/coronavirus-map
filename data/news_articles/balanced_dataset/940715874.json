But 78 years after his death, Mr Stevenson's name has finally been added to Thetford's war memorial.

But 78 years after his death, Mr Stevenson's name has finally been added to Thetford's war memorial. Photo: Colin Stevenson\n\nColin said: \u201cHe was part of that large contingent of Norfolk and Suffolk men who set of for the war in the desert late in 1941, only to be diverted to Singapore following the Japanese invasion.\n\n\u201cThey arrived on January 13 and were in action in Malaysia a few days after.\n\n\u201cHis company were holding a bridge open at Sengarrang, Jahore, to enable as many men as possible to get away from the enemy and retreat, but whilst he was doing that he was killed.\n\nYou may also want to watch:\n\n\u201cHe left a wife whom he did not know was expecting her second child, and a young son.\u201d\n\nColin\u2019s mother, who died in 2004, received a telegram saying her that her husband was missing in action, but it was not until 1945 that she received another to say that he was presumed dead.\n\nThe names of all the men from Thetford who died in the Second World War were added to the memorial in 1947, but not Norman Stevenson\u2019s.\n\nColin, now living in Surrey, said: \u201cMy grandfather and my mother were told by officialdom that this was because he wasn\u2019t born in Thetford and the memorial was for Thetford boys. Although he was born in Birkenhead, he had a wife, family and made a new home here in Thetford.\n\nPrivate Norman Stevenson, a WWII soldier, from the Royal Norfolk Regiment, 5th Battalion, died in battle in 1942. His name has been engraved on Thetford's war memorial 78 years after his death.

It was an overwhelming moment, but I was so pleased, so was my sister.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAll of the boys who served in a regiment should be on a memorial and on Saturday I will be there to pay my respects.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "twitter": {"card": "photo"}, "title": "Soldier\u2019s name added to war memorial 78 years after his death", "DC.title": "Soldier\u2019s name added to war memorial 78 years after his death", "og": {"title": "Soldier\u2019s name added to war memorial 78 years after his death", "description": "The son of a Second World War soldier has described the \u201coverwhelming\u201d moment his father\u2019s name was engraved on a town\u2019s war memorial, 78 years after his battlefield death.", "type": "article", "image": "https://www.edp24.co.uk/polopoly_fs/1.6791319!/image/image.jpg", "url": "https://www.edp24.co.uk/features/heritage/thetford-war-memorial-new-name-added-1-6791318", "site_name": "Eastern Daily Press"}, "author": "Emily Thomson", "DC.creator": "Emily Thomson", "keywords": "Heritage, People, Thetford", "DC.subject": "Heritage, People, Thetford", "DC.coverage.spatial": "Thetford", "fb": {"pages": 69186624810}, "description": "The son of a Second World War soldier has described the \u201coverwhelming\u201d moment his father\u2019s name was engraved on a town\u2019s war memorial, 78 years after his battlefield death.", "robots": "max-video-preview:-1", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "google-site-verification": "KHl4EKz0a0LTojvLJtxsSYhoa_rmJozrBpuzfJtRG_8", "theme-color": "#FFFFFF"}}}
