Milley listens while US President Donald Trump speaks in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, DC on October 7, 2019. BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/Getty Images\n\nTwo retired Army officers have written an open letter to Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, basically urging him to mount a military coup if President Trump loses the upcoming election but tries to remain in power on Jan. 20.\n\n\u201cIf Donald Trump refuses to leave office at the expiration of his constitutional term,\u201d they write for Defense One, a widely read national-security site, \u201cthe United States military must remove him by force, and you must give that order.\u201d\n\nThe authors, John Nagl and Paul Yingling, both served as lieutenant colonels during the Iraq war and gained a certain fame, or infamy, as outspoken critics of the Army\u2019s more hidebound traditions, notably its failure to promote the most creative officers\u2014a tendency that their essays on the subject helped change. Like many defense reporters, I have known them both for a long time; Nagl was a major character in, and a source for, one of my books, The Insurgents: David Petraeus and the Plot to Change the American Way of War.\n\nHowever, their letter to Milley puts forth a terrible idea\u2014and, more than that, an unnecessary one. It reflects a dangerous romanticization of the Great General on Horseback as democracy\u2019s savior\u2014and a surprising misunderstanding of the proper relationship between civilian and military authority (surprising because both Nagl and Yingling are scholars of the subject).\n\nThe fear that Trump will refuse to leave office, even if he loses the election, has been circulating for over a year now. I addressed the fear in a June 1 Slate column, arguing that Trump may want to lock himself in the Oval Office but \u201che wouldn\u2019t get away with it.\u201d At 12:00 p.m. on January 20, 2021, wherever Trump may choose to plant himself, all but a small retinue of security guards will abandon him, the nuclear launch codes will change, his cabinet secretaries and ambassadors will lose all authority, and the entire U.S. military establishment will pivot away from ex-President Trump to salute President Biden. \u201cThe principle of civilian control is hammered into American officers from the time they\u2019re cadets,\u201d I wrote, \u201cand the 20th Amendment of the Constitution states, \u2018The terms of the President and Vice President end at noon on the 20th day of January\u2019\u2014no ifs, ands, or buts.\u201d\n\nThe Secret Service will escort Mr. Trump out of the office. If a mob of Trump\u2019s favorite sheriffs and militias block the doors and circle the White House\u2014if, in short, a few tanks need to roll down Pennsylvania Avenue to restore order, then it will be President Biden, the duly elected and sworn-in commander of chief, who gives the order.\n\nThat is what Nagl and Yingling get wrong. \u201cAs the senior military officer of the United States,\u201d they write, Gen. Milley would face \u201ctwo options\u201d\u2014to \u201cgive unambiguous orders directing U.S. military forces to support the Constitutional transfer of power\u201d or to \u201cremain silent\u201d and thus \u201cbe complicit in a coup d\u2019etat.\u201d\n\nFirst, even if this were the military\u2019s role, it would not be Gen. Milley\u2019s. Under the Defense Reorganization Act of 1986, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff serves as the principal military adviser to the president. He (or, perhaps someday, she) has no power to command, or issue orders, to any members of the armed forces. That is the duty solely of the chiefs of staff of the military services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines) and their combatant commanders. In other words, Nagl and Yingling sent their letter to the wrong address.\n\nSecond, this is not the military\u2019s role. No military officer is empowered or obligated to do what Nagl and Yingling are telling Milley to do. In any military operation, the duty of all servicemen and women in an armed conflict or crisis is to obey lawful orders. If Trump ordered them to defend his extended tenure in office, that would be an unlawful order. If Biden ordered them to clear the White House grounds and escort Trump and his co-conspirators out of the building (in the extremely unlikely event that the Secret Service, U.S. Marshals, and other police forces were unable to do so), then that would be a lawful order.\n\nThe point is, it is not Gen. Milley but rather President Biden, the top civilian authority, who would issue such an order. If Nagl and Yingling are right in characterizing Trump\u2019s refusal to step down as \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest Constitutional crisis since the Civil War,\u201d the crisis would be exacerbated\u2014the nature and strength of American democracy would be called into question\u2014if it could be settled only by military intervention.\n\nMake no mistake: Trump will try to steal this election if he can, through suppressing the vote, confiscating mail-in ballots, and praying for Vladimir Putin to interfere again (this time a bit more forcefully, pozhaluysta). But this is not the scenario that Nagl and Yingling (and other worriers) lay out. They envision Trump refusing to leave office after the electors cast their ballots and Biden is sworn into office. This would be unprecedented, of course. But the system is set up to deal with this scenario, without a four-star general taking control. And if the system proves incapable, if Milley has to take Nagl and Yingling\u2019s letter to heart, then the country is headed for a crash, one way or the other.", "METADATA": {"civicscience": {"jspoll-hostname": "www138.civicscience.com"}, "application-name": "It\u2019s Not the Military\u2019s Job to Remove Trump from Office if He Won\u2019t Leave", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "Trump", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Don\u2019t count on Mark Milley to rescue American democracy.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}}}
