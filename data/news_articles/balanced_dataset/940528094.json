The 34-year-old man, who cannot be identified until he has formally pleaded to the kidnapping charge and two counts of rape, appeared briefly in court on Wednesday where the prosecutor, Nqobile Malinga, indicated the State would oppose his bail application. Magistrate Queen Khuzwayo told the accused that his attorney had submitted an affidavit with an alternative address for him. Khuzwayo said it was left to the investigating officer on whether he would change his stance in opposing bail. She adjourned the matter until next Thursday for a formal bail application. The man will be kept at Hillcrest SAPS. No family were present in court in support of the man nor were the victim\u2019s family present.\n\nThe victim and the man had lived in the same residential complex.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily News outside court, the man\u2019s attorney, Wesley Rogers, confirmed that he had submitted an affidavit to the court with an alternative residential address for his client should he be granted bail.\n\nRogers said police would have to verify the address. He said his client had been charged with kidnapping at Mountain Rise police station. He said his client had been charged for rape on Monday, at the Hillcrest police station.\n\nPolice spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said police arrested the man in Port Shepstone on Sunday.\n\nMbele said the accused was wanted for kidnapping and a rape incident that took place on August 7 at 6.30pm in the Mountain Rise area.\n\nThe 28-year-old victim was kidnapped on Thursday night.\n\nDaily News", "METADATA": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "5A0910AA1A12E32A5352933CF5FD96E9", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "iQCzO2whcLNU6_F3xi1Dck7JMALz7869mBLTQf08wJo", "fb": {"app_id": 293175074032541}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Man charged for kidnap and rape of PMB woman remains in police custody... for now", "description": "The 34-year-old man, who cannot be identified until he has formally pleaded to the kidnapping charge and two counts of rape, appeared briefly in court on Wednesday", "url": "https://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/news/man-charged-for-kidnap-and-rape-of-pmb-woman-remains-in-police-custody-for-now--fd7fa4bb-eaab-4202-8740-fe54fd13b0cb", "image": {"identifier": "https://image-prod.iol.co.za/resize/710x366?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/abd45bc0-e0d0-59c4-9ef3-5c1cf5572f48&operation=CROP&offset=17x0&resize=676x380", "secure_url": "https://image-prod.iol.co.za/resize/710x366?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/abd45bc0-e0d0-59c4-9ef3-5c1cf5572f48&operation=CROP&offset=17x0&resize=676x380"}}, "description": "The 34-year-old man, who cannot be identified until he has formally pleaded to the kidnapping charge and two counts of rape, appeared briefly in court on Wednesday", "twitter": {"site": "@IOL", "creator": "@IOL", "title": "Man charged for kidnap and rape of PMB woman remains in police custody... for now", "description": "The 34-year-old man, who cannot be identified until he has formally pleaded to the kidnapping charge and two counts of rape, appeared briefly in court on Wednesday", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"src": "https://image-prod.iol.co.za/resize/710x366?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/abd45bc0-e0d0-59c4-9ef3-5c1cf5572f48&operation=CROP&offset=17x0&resize=676x380"}}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
