It has petitioned Prime Minister Moeketsi Majoro to suspend Commissioner Molibeli to facilitate investigations into the latter\u2019s alleged criminal misconduct, maladministration and abuse of power.\n\nThe police boss has hit back by initiating moves to fire LEPOSA members who he brands as \u201crogue\u201d police officers out to derail the Lesotho Mounted Police Service (LMPS) from doing its work. He has also accused some of his subordinates of \u201cengaging in an open rebellion against the police management\u201d.\n\nCommissioner Molibeli has particularly trained his guns on LEPOSA national treasurer, Lance Sergeant \u2018Mathebe Motseki. He on Monday slapped her with a letter demanding she \u201cshow cause\u201d why she should not be dismissed for her recent statements which allegedly tarnished the image of the police command.\n\nSpeaking earlier this month at the funeral of one Lance Corporal Thabang Molelekoa in Mafeteng, Lance Sergeant Motseki allegedly accused the police authorities of transferring some police officers as punishment for opening a case against former First Lady \u2018Maesaiah Thabane for allegedly assaulting a Maseru man at State House in January 2019.\n\nLance Sergeant Motseki is also alleged to have accused the police command of failing to arrest Deputy Police Commissioner (DCP) Paseka Mokete after a female junior police officer accused him of sexual assault in April 2020. The case is now before the courts.\n\nPart of the \u201cshow cause\u201d letter to Lance Sergeant Motseki reads: \u201cyou will not deny that your utterances were solely intended to tarnish the image of the LMPS and its management\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou will not deny that taken holistically, your utterances at the said funeral amount to only one conclusion that it was meant to subvert the good order, discipline or lawful authority and thereby bringing (sic) the police service into disrepute. You are aware of the powers vested upon the Commissioner of Police in terms of provisions of Section 31 (1) (i) of the Lesotho Mounted Police Service Act of 1998.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of the foregoing, I have been instructed by the Commissioner of Police to demand from you, as I hereby do, reasons if any, why the provisions of Section 31 (1) of the Lesotho Mounted Police Service Act of 1998 may not be invoked against you.\n\n\u201cYour written response is expected to reach this office within seven days upon receipt of this letter. Failure to give your response within the stipulated time will be considered that you have waived your right to make a representation,\u201d the letter states. It was written by the LMPS\u2019 human resource officer, Superintendent Marou on behalf of Commissioner Molibeli.\n\nSection 31 of the LMPS Act empowers the police commissioner to dismiss police officers after giving them an opportunity to defend themselves.\n\nLance Sergeant Motseki received the \u201cshow cause\u201d letter on Monday, the same day that Commissioner Molibeli instructed one Senior Superintendent Shale to warn police officers against the behaviour of \u201crogue\u201d officers whom he said had openly rebelled against him.\n\nA day earlier, the police command had issued a similar memo warning of tough measures against the \u201crogue\u201d elements.\n\nThe fighting statements from the police command come barely a fortnight after LEPOSA asked Dr Majoro to suspend Commissioner Molibeli to facilitate investigations into the latter\u2019s alleged criminal misconduct, maladministration and abuse of power. (See story above).\n\nThe head of the police complaints and discipline department, ACP Motlatsi Mapola, also stalked the fires by asking the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Advocate Hlalefang Motinyane to prosecute Commissioner Molibeli and one of his top assistants ACP Beleme Lebajoa for abuse of office after they allegedly protected \u2018Maesaiah from being prosecuted for assaulting a Maseru man.\n\nLEPOSA and ACP Mapola\u2019s pursuit of Commissioner Molibeli and his close allies triggered the top cop\u2019s fightback as evidenced by the Sunday and Monday memos warning of \u201crogue\u201d police officers who are allegedly \u201cin open rebellion against the police command\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt has some to the attention of the police command that there are of some rogue elements in the police service masquerading as LEPOSA. The rogue elements have gone out of their ways to publicise false information about the police as well as dragging the good name of the police through the mud (sic).\n\n\u201cTheir behaviour is unacceptable to the entire nation. These rogue elements have gone further to include or use the name of senior people in the country, including the name of the Prime Minister (Dr Majoro) in their sinister agenda seemingly affecting the stability of this country. (sic).\n\n\u201cThe police management will therefore take decisive and legal disciplinary measures to bring the situation under control. Those members of the LMPS are therefore warned to immediately cease from involving themselves in their scoundrel behaviour,\u201d the police command states in its Sunday statement. It is not clear who authored the statement but it was distributed to police officers by police spokesperson Superintendent Mpiti Mopeli.\n\nBut LEPOSA has refused to cowed by the police bosses.\n\nOn Monday, the police union wrote back to the police command, saying, \u201cwe are appalled by this statement because only the LEPOSA national executive committee (NEC) has the right and authority to discipline its members in cases of indiscipline\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe therefore remind you all that LEPOSA is an independent body which is not governed by the police management.\n\n\u201cLEPOSA is not ashamed to stand by the statements, verbal and written, made by its members in the media. LEPOSA members are not making these statements in their personal capacity and there is no way they can be victimised for carrying out their mandates on behalf of the association. The threat by the police management is intended to stifle the association,\u201d LEPOSA stated on Monday.\n\nThe police command again responded to LEPOSA the same day through Snr Supt Shale\u2019s memo, saying he had been instructed by Commissioner Molibeli to inform all police officers that some police officers \u201cmasquerading as LEPOSA, have embarked on an open rebellion against the police management\u201d.\n\n\u201cLEPOSA is an association established in terms of section 66 of Police Act of 1998 and the Police Regulations of 2003. As such, the police management is fully aware of the objectives of this police association. The ongoing media onslaught by LEPOSA office bearers on the police management have nothing to do with LEPOSA objectives but they are only based on personal whims.\n\n\u201cMembers of the LMPS, particularly those who are members of LEPOSA, are to note that there was a meeting on the 10 July 2020 chaired by the police authority, (Police and Public Safety) Minister \u2018Mamoipone Senauoane, with LEPOSA and LMPS management. This meeting was the first step towards the formation of a police negotiating council\u2026\n\n\u201cThe LMPS management advises members of LEPOSA to be vigilant and ensure control of their association\u2019s affairs. Lest the few take advantage and drift it astray as they whet their own personal and political interests at the expense of the association,\u201d Snr Supt Shale said.\n\nIn its response to the Monday memo, LEPOSA denied that there ever was a meeting on 10 July. The association said it was shocked to learn of the \u201cdivisive tendencies lately adopted by management of police\u201d.\n\nIt however, said Ms Senauoane only paid a \u201ccourtesy call on LEPOSA and the police management on 15 July 2020.\n\n\u201cThe minister strictly emphasised the encounter was only courteous\u2026 The issue of establishing police negotiating council did not arise. It is also pertinent to state that even the issues raised in the (LEPOSA) letter to the Prime Minister were not a subject of discussion at the courtesy meeting.\u201d\n\nLEPOSA accused the police management of attempting to sow divisions among LEPOSA members through its statements.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Commissioner Molibeli fights \u201crogue\u201d LEPOSA elements \u00a0 - Lesotho Times", "description": "claims they are in open rebellion against him Pascalinah Kabi POLICE Commissioner Holomo Molibeli\u2019s fight with the militant Lesotho Mounted Police Service Staff Association (LEPOSA) is escalating and threatens to tear apart the police service.
