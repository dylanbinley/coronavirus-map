And now it\u2019s almost a drought,\u201d said Dereu, who works seven days a week despite his age.\n\n\u201cThis year we are definitely going to lose money,\u201d he added as he climbed onto his tractor.\n\nThe French government said climate change is almost certainly to blame.\n\nThe environment ministry said that \u201con average harvests across France are taking place 18 days earlier than there were 40 years ago.\u201d\n\nThis was a clear \u201cmarker of global warming\u201d, it added.\n\n\u2018Spanish grapes will grow in UK\u2019\n\nIn her laboratory in Rivesaltes, oenologist Anne Tixier is worried about the \u201cdisturbing\u201d way the rise in temperatures has been affecting wine production as she tests the pressed grape juice straight from the vineyards.\n\n\u201cWe are going to end up growing Spanish grape varieties in England\u201d if this continues, she said as she tasted the first small muscat grapes of 2020 with their distinctive notes of lemon.\n\n\u201cWe have been watching harvests get earlier for 30 years,\u201d Tixier added.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer deny climate change. We have got to think about the future, maybe by using other varieties or hybrids to adapt\u201d to global warming.\n\nPierre Ruel, whose vineyards are in the nearby village of Salses-le-Chateau, is still passionate about the wine he produces but admits that it \u201cwould be more profitable to sell my vineyards than to work them.\u201d\n\nDereu wants to retire but \u201cno one in my family wants to take it on. The young ones would rather work behind a desk than have to do hard physical labor,\u201d he sighed.\n\nClick here for more weather related news.\n\nFor more news about the novel coronavirus click here.\n\nWhat you need to know about Coronavirus.\n\nFor more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.\n\nThe Inquirer Foundation supports our healthcare frontliners and is still accepting cash donations to be deposited at Banco de Oro (BDO) current account #007960018860 or donate through PayMaya using this link .\n\nRead Next\n\nEDITORS' PICK\n\nMOST READ", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"ttl": 345600, "title": "Climate change sours French winemakers\u2019 bitter harvest", "description": "Rivesaltes, France \u2014 Just when it seemed the year could not get more awful for French winemakers, it has got worse.\r\n\r\nWith coronavirus lockdowns sending sales plummeting, some have had to turn", "url": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1321910/climate-change-sours-french-winemakers-bitter-harvest", "site_name": "INQUIRER.net", "image": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2020/08/000_1WH1A1-620x414.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 175228195865217, "pages": 142802334452}, "article": {"published_time": "Sat, 15 Aug 2020 01:02:47 PST"}, "author": "Agence France-Presse", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Rivesaltes, France \u2014 Just when it seemed the year could not get more awful for French winemakers, it has got worse.
