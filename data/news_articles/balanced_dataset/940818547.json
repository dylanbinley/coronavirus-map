Her trip to Dubai with her employer\u2019s family has turned into a \u201cnightmare.\u201d\n\nBautista has been in United Arab Emirates since March. Her Canadian temporary residence visa and work permits have expired.\n\nBautista is now alone in Dubai and has a deadline to leave the city by Sept. 20, when her visitor visa expires there, says The Star.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone here. I\u2019m scared to go out. This is a disaster, a nightmare,\u201d says the 35-year-old, who came to work as a live-in caregiver for a Brampton, Ontario, family in 2018 after working as a caregiver in Hong Kong for a decade. \u201cMy worst fear is I will never be able to return to Canada again.\u201d\n\nBoth stories were reported and updated by The Star.\n\nOver the past few months, Bautista\u2019s employer has reached out to the Immigration Department, Canada Border Services Agency, MPs and Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino\u2019s office to bring the family\u2019s caregiver home, to no avail.\n\nBautista immediately reapplied for a new visa, but then her work permit also expired. She can\u2019t renew or extend her work permit while she\u2019s out of Canada. Without a valid work permit, she has lost her status as a caregiver, and proof that her return to Canada is essential.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBautista is temporarily living with a friend of her employers in Dubai.\n\n\u201cThis situation Ms. Bautista finds herself in is just astounding and deadly serious. She has done nothing wrong and has followed all the rules,\u201d said NDP immigration critic Jenny Kwan, who has reached out to the immigration minister\u2019s office for help on Bautista\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cShe has been stranded in Dubai because of the cumulative impact of the global pandemic. The inability for IRCC to exercise discretion to accommodate the extenuating circumstances needs to be fixed immediately.\u201d\n\nKwan said the minister can use his discretion to issue the woman a new visa and work permit or expedite her permanent residence application. So far, Kwan said, she has not heard from Mendicino\u2019s office, which did not respond to the Star\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe borders of the Philippines are open to its citizens returning from abroad, but Bautista said it\u2019s not an option.\n\n\u201cI have five family members to support back home. There were very few jobs in the Philippines even before Covid-19,\u201d said a stressed Bautista. \u201cI\u2019ve worked very hard and invested so much in building a life in Canada. I don\u2019t know where to go if I can\u2019t go back there.\u201d\n\nDe Ramos flew with her Philippines passport to Mexico on March 1 with Lucas and her husband to look after their two boys, one who is four, the other 10 months, on their vacation, reports The Star.\n\n\u201cMy life and all my possessions are in Canada, and I know this is the case for many temporary residents like me. In these unique circumstances, please don\u2019t turn away people who pay taxes and work hard to build the multicultural Canadian community we all are proud of.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Star, it is not known how many temporary foreign workers, international students and other temporary residence visa holders are currently stranded overseas and banned from re-entering Canada, but the latest immigration data shows Ottawa had issued 2.4 million temporary residence permits in 2019.\n\nPetition Started\n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/marco-mendicino-help-genalin-bautista-return-to-canada?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_24076928_en-CA%3A2&recruiter=48476187&recruited_by_id=fc1519e0-8d93-0130-811e-3c764e04b838&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_abi", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "Teodoro \u2018Ted\u2019 Alcuitas", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pandemic puts 2 Filipino caregivers\u2019 lives in limbo", "description": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 Two Filipina caregivers who traveled with their employers abroad are stuck outside Canada due to Covid-19 restrictions.
