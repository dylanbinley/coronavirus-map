And that includes the pastor and the pianist and any little kids that happen to come. It\u2019s really small. We\u2019re one of those little churches you read about. In some ways you might look at it like we\u2019re just barely hanging on, if you look at our numbers and our budget. On the other hand, we are so vital in our community and in our larger community.\u201d\n\nWhite Rock Presbyterian Church exemplifies that vitality through its ongoing work with the Navajo Nation. According to the Navajo Nation Department of Health, the Navajo Nation has one of the highest coronavirus infection rates in the country. WRPC, in partnership with Navajo House of Fellowship near Bread Springs, south of Gallup, has worked through a small nonprofit organization, Nihitaa\u2019 Binaanish, meaning \u201cOur Father\u2019s Business,\u201d to assist the Navajo Nation community during this unprecedented time. The nonprofit was started with assistance from WRPC to help funding go directly to the Navajo community.\n\n\u201cThis is more than a project,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThis is just woven into the fabric of our whole church. It was there way before the pandemic started and it will be there way afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an ongoing partnership and there are so many unique things about it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut one of the interesting things is the Navajo church. It\u2019s a local kind of almost house church. It\u2019s led by two Navajo pastors who are so dedicated to serve, serving their community and just being the hands and the feet of the church.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a humble little church. The church has no running water,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are just servants. They\u2019re on the ground, and they\u2019ve been doing that work for 20 years before we started partnering with them in 2008.\u201d Holmes says the Navajo church came to their town to help the White Rock congregation.\n\n\u201cThe Navajo House of Fellowship congregation comes up periodically to help us. When we were recently in between pastors, Pastor Fred (Fred Thomas) came up and preached for us. They came up and worked on fundraising events for Nihitaa\u2019 Binaanish.\u201d\n\nHolmes says that in addition to the physical help, the Navajo House of Fellowship shares its spiritual gifts and culture with WRPC.\n\n\u201cMost of us are not young,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cWe were stuck in old music and they bring their praise band and drums and guitars and get us going. They taught us Navajo ways of praising and singing hymns. So then in turn we go down to Bread Springs. We help with building projects and whatever they need.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo this is an ongoing partnership between the two churches,\u201d Holmes said, \u201cthat has been going on for a long time.\u201d\n\nHolmes says the two churches are now working together to address the devastating impact the pandemic has had on the Navajo Nation. Unlike in the past when the churches worked to offer sustainable assistance, they have now shifted their focus.\n\n\u201cWe typically don\u2019t give out stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe typically invest in training, mentor and mentee relationships to teach and learn construction work and those kinds of things. We build ramps for mobility. We put in bathrooms so they can have access to water through the tribal infrastructure.\u201d Holmes says that changed when COVID-19 hit and the number of coronavirus cases in the Navajo community skyrocketed.\n\nThe Navajo people need tools to fight the virus, she said. Particularly needed are water, access to Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and cleaning supplies.\n\nWhite Rock Presbyterian Church and Navajo House of Fellowship through Nihitaa\u2019 Binaanish have collaborated with other organizations including the National Guard, private entities like food banks and other nonprofits to bring needed items including food to the Navajo people.\n\nHolmes says the response has been tremendous. She says five National Guard truckloads of water and supplies have been delivered to the Navajo people. Just last week there was a large dairy truck that delivered needed products, and 500 boxes of food was distributed. \u201cPeople just pulled up in their cars and we put it in their trunks and at the same time, we\u2019re really trying to promote the Navajo Nation\u2019s Department of Health protocols by educating people on the importance of wearing masks, social distancing and hygiene,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso, WRPC members have made masks, donated supplies and financially supported the efforts. \u201cWe feel that God has called us to do this work,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a wonderful pastor, Deb Worley, who just came on last year and she has just jumped in the middle of this and been so supportive.\u201d\n\nWhile White Rock Presbyterian Church may be small by some measures, but it\u2019s obviously doing a very mighty work. It is a living example of a Matthew 25 church.", "METADATA": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.presbyterianmission.org/wp-content/uploads/cropped-pma-favicon-270x270.png", "msapplication-config": "https://www.presbyterianmission.org/wp-content/themes/presbyterian-mission/library/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "Meet New Mexico\u2019s White Rock Presbyterian Church, the personification of congregational vitality, which works with partners to aid the Navajo Nation.", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Small but mighty | Presbyterian Mission Agency", "description": "Meet New Mexico\u2019s White Rock Presbyterian Church, the personification of congregational vitality, which works with partners to aid the Navajo Nation.", "url": "https://www.presbyterianmission.org/story/small-but-mighty/", "site_name": "Presbyterian Mission Agency", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.presbyterianmission.org/wp-content/uploads/2020-whiterockpcfood.jpg", "width": 400, "height": 400}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pcusa"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@Presbyterian", "site": "@Presbyterian"}, "tec-api-version": "v1", "tec-api-origin": "https://www.presbyterianmission.org"}}}
