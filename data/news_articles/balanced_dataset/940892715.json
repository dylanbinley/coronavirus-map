However out of the 15 member UN Security Council only the Dominican Republic backed the American proposal.\n\nChina and Russia both opposed the move whilst the 11 other members all abstained. These included Britain and France, which both have permanent seats on the council, and Germany. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday accused the council of having \u201cfailed to uphold its fundamental mission set\u201d by not passing the measures. Describing Iran as \u201cthe world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terror\u201d he accused the UN council of having \u201crejected a reasonable appeal\u201d to contain it.\n\nThe UN Security Council rejected extending sanctions on Iran\n\nThe US proposal was rejected by the UN Security Council\n\nMr Pompeo added: \u201cThe Security Council's failure to act decisively in defence of international peace and security is inexcusable. \u201cThe United States will never abandon our friends in the region who expected more from the Security Council. \u201cWe will continue to work to ensure that the theocratic terror regime does not have the freedom to purchase and sell weapons that threaten the heart of Europe, the Middle East and beyond.\u201d The motion was backed by Israel and six Gulf Cooperation Council nations, all of which feel threatened by Iranian activity in the region.

The agreement was designed to stop Iran acquiring nuclear weapons but Mr Trump claimed the Iranians weren\u2019t living up to the spirit of the agreement and were continuing to back terror groups across the Middle East. The other countries that signed the agreement; China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, all opposed the US withdrawal. Since the American withdrawal tensions between Washington and Tehran have soured with the US linking Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards to a number of attacks on western interests during 2019.\n\nIn January of this year Qasem Soleimani, who commanded the Revolutionary Guard\u2019s elite Quds Force, was killed by a US airstrike near Baghdad Airport. Iran retaliated by firing missiles at US bases in Iraq but these didn\u2019t result in any American fatalities. Russian president Vladimir Putin defended the Iranian position in a statement released on Friday.\n\nAnti-US protest after the killing of Qasem Soleimani", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "DONALD TRUMP'S bid to extend UN sanctions on Iran has been defeated at the body's security council in a bitter blow to the US president.", "fb": {"pages": 129617873765147, "app_id": 823607694325129}, "og": {"title": "Donald Trump HUMILIATED as UN Security Council refuses to extend sanctions on Iran", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1323122/Donald-Trump-news-US-Iran-UN-Tehran-sanctions-Mike-Pompeo-Russia-Security-Council", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/750x445/1323122.jpg", "site_name": "Express.co.uk", "language": "en", "tags": "headlines,politics,world,ctp_video,autoplay_video,Donald Trump news,US,Iran,UN,Tehran,sanctions,Mike Pompeo,Russia,UN Security Council", "section": "World", "description": "DONALD TRUMP'S bid to extend UN sanctions on Iran has been defeated at the body's security council in a bitter blow to the US president."}, "news_keywords": "headlines,politics,world,ctp_video,autoplay_video,Donald Trump news,US,Iran,UN,Tehran,sanctions,Mike Pompeo,Russia,UN Security Council", "article": {"tag": "UN Security Council", "published_time": "2020-08-15T03:36:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-15T07:12:50+01:00", "expiration_time": "2020-09-14", "section": "World", "image_count": 6, "video_count": 2, "word_count": 705, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 0}, "author": "James Bickerton", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"src": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/750x445/1323122.jpg"}, "title": "Donald Trump HUMILIATED as UN Security Council refuses to extend sanctions on Iran", "description": "DONALD TRUMP'S bid to extend UN sanctions on Iran has been defeated at the body's security council in a bitter blow to the US president."}, "video_autoplay": "false", "headline_short": "Donald Trump HUMILIATED as UN Security Council refuses to extend sanctions on Iran", "verify-v1": "EGl3XPBuem43awGwLC1rXGpRHRnmNSwp7VZfnCAAcKE=", "msvalidate.01": "1960193A20395DAD3FCB640BCB0D91D7", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "noodp,noydir,all"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
