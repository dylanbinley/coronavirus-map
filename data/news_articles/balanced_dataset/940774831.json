But even with its massive size, the card giant wasn't immune to the coronavirus pandemic slowing global spending. Revenue dropped 17% year-over-year at Mastercard, according to its second-quarter earnings.\n\nTo be sure, the pandemic has accelerated consumers' shift toward more digital, touch-free payments, which could benefit Mastercard in the long run.\n\nAnd there are opportunities beyond just cards.\n\nRevenue from cyber, intelligence, and data, which Mastercard reports as 'other revenue,' was up 14% year-over-year. Those business are expected to grow, especially as payments increasingly shift online.\n\n\"More digital transactions versus more cash transactions is more data,\" Michael Miebach, Mastercard's president and incoming CEO said during its second-quarter earnings call. \"More data means more desire and more need for data analytics capabilities, but also to protect that data. So our cyber solutions are going to benefit from that in the long run.\"\n\nIn June, Mastercard acquired data startup Finicity, furthering its ambitions in consumer data. And its engagement with fintechs has positioned the incumbent to grow alongside disruptors in the payments space.\n\nFrom working with fintechs to managing the network's global cybersecurity infrastructure, here are the 15 execs at Mastercard driving its growth both through cards and otherwise.\n\nHave a tip?
