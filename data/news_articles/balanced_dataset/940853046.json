Eshwarappa told reporters at Shivamogga in the state\u2019s northwest Malnad region.\n\nA few representatives and members of the SDPI were booked and arrested since the mob violence in the city\u2019s northeast suburb on August 11, for allegedely instigating the miscreants to go on a rampage, which led to arson and rioting in the area and subsequent police firing to prevent the volatile situation going out of control. Three youth were killed in the violence.\n\n\u201cThe state government is under pressure from many groups and organisations to ban the fringe groups, as they have been allegedly involved in causing unrest and disharmony in society,\u201d asserted Eshwarappa.\n\nState Revenue Minister R. Ashoka also hinted at banning the twin political outfits for their alleged involvement in the city\u2019s riots and in other parts of the southern state in the past.\n\n\u201cPreliminary investigation and interrogation of the arrested SDPI and PFI members revealed their alleged involvement in the riots on August 11. Its activists were also held in the past for allegedly causing disharmony in society,\u201d Ashoka told reporters here.\n\nDeputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan also said the state government was considering banning the twin parties for their alleged role in the city riots.\n\nState Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said internal rift in the opposition Congress and the SDPI\u2019s conspiracy were behind the riots in the city.\n\n\u201cInvestigations into the riots so far revealed that political differences in the Congress, its differences with the SDPI and the latter\u2019s larger conspiracy to disrupt law and order had a role in the city\u2019s mob violence,\u201d Bommai told reporters after reviewing the situation with top police officials here.\n\nIn all, 206 accused were arrested in connection with the riots, including 60 earlier in the day. Among those held included Kaleem Pasha, husband of Congress corporator Irshad Begum from the Nagwara civic ward in the city\u2019s eastern suburb.\n\nA derogatory Facebook post by Congress MLA Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy\u2019s nephew P. Naveen on August 11 triggered the violence, arson and rioting by unruly mobs in the densely populated areas of the city\u2019s suburb.\n\nMurthy, who joined the Congress from the Janata Dal-Secular (JD-S), won from the Pulakeshinagar reserved (ST) constituency in the May 2018 state assembly elections for the second time.\n\nRefuting the Congress charge that inaction by the police against Naveen led to the violence, Bommai said it was an attempt to mislead the public, as there was no delay in filing an FIR against the accused.\n\nSource: IANS\n\nDisclaimer: This story is auto-generated from IANS service.", "METADATA": {"google-site-verification": "WBCm_7wL36LRSXmTyVOznSVTdM5XX0Id9zj9nH6SeEs", "msvalidate.01": "40E981DE47FB62D9ABE31E163D2E51EC", "description": "Bengaluru, Aug 15 : Karnataka is mulling to ban the regional outfit Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and its political affiliate Popular Front of", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "K'taka mulling to ban SDPI for role in B'luru riots: Minister", "description": "Bengaluru, Aug 15 : Karnataka is mulling to ban the regional outfit Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and its political affiliate Popular Front of", "url": "https://www.siasat.com/ktaka-mulling-to-ban-sdpi-for-role-in-bluru-riots-minister-1947988/", "site_name": "The Siasat Daily", "image": "https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ktaka-mulling-to-ban-SDPI-for-role-in-Bluru-riots.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/siasatdaily", "published_time": "2020-08-14T21:02:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T21:02:24+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 347054199344775, "pages": 127989700566127}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TheSiasatDaily", "site": "@TheSiasatDaily"}, "geo.placename": "Hyderabad", "geo.position": "17.3863312;78.4736654", "geo.region": "India", "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "theme-color": "#064588", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-the-siasat-daily-fav-logo-470x470.png"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
