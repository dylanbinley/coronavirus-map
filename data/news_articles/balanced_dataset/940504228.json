Kissana Phathanacharoen said he is concerned about the references to the monarchy during the recent anti-government rallies, which he said could become provocative and result in protesters of different camps clashing on each other.\n\n\u201cI ask the protesters, especially those behind the Monday\u2019s protest at Thammasat University, to consider legal boundaries,\u201d Col. Kissana said. \u201cI believe everyone knows what can and can\u2019t be done.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman also said police will seek court permission to revoke bail for civil rights lawyer and activist Arnon Nampha, who was arrested and later released on charges of sedition and breaking the Emergency Decree for his role in the protests.\n\nHis bond was set at 100,000 baht each and granted on a condition that they would not \u201crepeat\u201d the offenses. Arnon later went onstage and gave speeches at several rallies.\n\nAt the Parliament, coalition politicians also demanded PM Prayut Chan-o-cha to take strict action against the protesters.\n\n\u201cI have received complaints from the public that they feel uncomfortable with the current political climate,\u201d Bhumjaithai MP Sanong Thep-aksornnarong said at a parliamentary session. \u201cThey want to see strict enforcement of law, and they must end up in prison if they are guilty.\u201d\n\nSonthiya Sawasdee, a former MP candidate for the ruling Palang Pracharath Party, also filed a complaint against those behind Monday\u2019s rally at Khlong Luang Police Station on Thursday afternoon.\n\nHe said the references to the Royal Family made on stage could be considered as a violation of Article 108 of the Penal Code, which punishes anyone who commits or calls for violence against the monarch.\n\n\u201cI agree with the protest, but it must not infringe on the rights of others,\u201d Sonthiya said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see Thailand end up having a civil war like in Syria.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.khaosodenglish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSCF1978.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.khaosodenglish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSCF1978.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 667}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Student Protesters Told to Be Careful in Their Speeches", "description": "BANGKOK \u2014 A police spokesman on Thursday urged protesters to stay within the boundary of the laws in their protests against PM Prayut Chan-o-cha\u2019s administration.", "url": "https://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/crimecourtscalamity/2020/08/13/student-protesters-told-to-be-careful-in-their-speeches/", "site_name": "Khaosod English", "updated_time": "2020-08-13T09:00:41+00:00"}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KhaosodEnglish/", "tag": "Elections", "section": "Crime, Courts, Calamity", "published_time": "2020-08-13T08:30:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T09:00:41+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "BANGKOK \u2014 A police spokesman on Thursday urged protesters to stay within the boundary of the laws in their protests against PM Prayut Chan-o-cha\u2019s administration.", "title": "Student Protesters Told to Be Careful in Their Speeches", "site": "@KhaosodEnglish", "image": "https://www.khaosodenglish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSCF1978.jpg", "creator": "@KhaosodEnglish"}, "generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 6.2.2 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface.", "fb": {"pages": 536126593072944}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/crimecourtscalamity/2020/08/13/student-protesters-told-to-be-careful-in-their-speeches/?ia_markup=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.khaosodenglish.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cropped-kelogo-270x270.gif"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
