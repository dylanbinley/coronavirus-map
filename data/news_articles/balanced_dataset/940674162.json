The officials will also visit Panama.\n\nClaver-Carone cited strong private sector interest in the \u201cBack to the Americas\u201d program, which will offer as yet undefined financial incentives to U.S. companies to move production facilities back to the region from Asia.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s huge corporate will and we want to take advantage of that,\u201d he said.\n\nColombia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Francisco Santos, in April said his country was in talks with several U.S. companies interested in moving facilities there.\n\nClaver-Carone said security issues would also play a key role during the visit to Colombia, which shares a long border with Venezuela, whose socialist leader Nicolas Maduro has been blacklisted by Washington.", "METADATA": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "ousivMolt", "DCSext.ChannelList": "ousivMolt;IN-The-Wire;INWire_EL;everythingNews", "description": "U.S. officials will unveil a major economic investment program with the Colombian government next week as Washington expands its drive to yank supply chains out of China and bring them closer to home, a senior White House official said Thursday.", "Author": "Andrea Shalal", "keywords": "US,USA,LATAM,Americas,Company News,South America / Central America,International Trade,Tariffs,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,China (PRC),Colombia,Venezuela,Panama,Asia / Pacific,Major News,Energy (TRBC),US Government News,International / National Security,United States", "news_keywords": "US;USA;LATAM;Americas;Company News;South America / Central America;International Trade;Tariffs;Diplomacy / Foreign Policy;China (PRC);Colombia;Venezuela;Panama;Asia / Pacific;Major News;Energy (TRBC);US Government News;International / National Security;United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Fri Aug 14 01:54:14 UTC 2020", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2020-08-14T01:54:14+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Andrea Shalal", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-latam-idINKCN25A06H", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "U.S. plans major investment program with Colombia: White House", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "IN", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,USA,LATAM,Americas,Company News,South America / Central America,International Trade,Tariffs,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,China (PRC),Colombia,Venezuela,Panama,Asia / Pacific,Major News,Energy (TRBC),US Government News,International / National Security,United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-USA-LATAM", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "U.S. plans major investment program with Colombia: White House", "sailthru.author": "Andrea Shalal", "sailthru.date": "2020-08-14T01:54:14+0000", "sailthru.title": "U.S. plans major investment program with Colombia: White House", "og": {"locale": "en_IN", "site_name": "IN", "title": "U.S. plans major investment program with Colombia: White House", "url": "https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-latam-idINKCN25A06H", "type": "article", "description": "U.S. officials will unveil a major economic investment program with the Colombian government next week as Washington expands its drive to yank supply chains out of China and bring them closer to home, a senior White House official said Thursday.", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T01:54:14+0000", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T01:54:14+0000", "section": "Markets", "author": "Andrea Shalal", "tag": "US,USA,LATAM,Americas,Company News,South America / Central America,International Trade,Tariffs,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,China (PRC),Colombia,Venezuela,Panama,Asia / Pacific,Major News,Energy (TRBC),US Government News,International / National Security,United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/india.reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ReutersIndia", "creator": "@ReutersIndia", "card": "summary", "title": "U.S. plans major investment program with Colombia: White House", "description": "U.S. officials will unveil a major economic investment program with the Colombian government next week as Washington expands its drive to yank supply chains out of China and bring them closer to home, a senior White House official said Thursday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "in.reuters/business/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Article -
