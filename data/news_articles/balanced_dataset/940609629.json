The state of Israel has never had diplomatic relations with the Gulf Arab countries, and this type of normalization has long been sought by both the Israeli and U.S. governments. Other Sunni Arab governments may soon follow: The UAE is a regional leader and close ally of Saudi Arabia. While the exact role of the U.S. in facilitating this deal is still unclear, it does appear to be a rare diplomatic win for the Trump administration, and one that may have been made possible by the administration\u2019s close ties to both governments.\n\nNow, those caveats. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described today\u2019s announcement as a \u201csignificant step forward for peace in the Middle East.\u201d It would be more accurate to say it\u2019s a step in the solidification of the region\u2019s fault lines. Iran was not mentioned in today\u2019s statement, but it\u2019s very much the backdrop of all of this. As analyst Karim Sadjadpour quipped, \u201cCongratulations to Iran for helping to midwife the normalization of relations between the UAE and Israel.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to the Slatest newsletter A daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.

Rather than a \u201cstep forward for peace,\u201d it could make armed conflict more likely, not less, particularly if Trump returns to office next year.\n\nThe announcement more or less just makes official what\u2019s been obvious for some time now: The Sunni Arab monarchies may condemn Israel in public, but they are tacitly allied in a regional conflict with Iran. The governments view that conflict as a bigger priority than Israel\u2019s occupation of the Palestinian territories, though they\u2019ve been reluctant to say it publicly and risk backlash. A leaked 2017 Israeli diplomatic cable revealed that the Israeli government was instructing its diplomats to support Saudi Arabia\u2019s criticism of Iran and its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah. A video clip posted by the Israeli government last year showed the foreign ministers of three Arab countries defending Israel and criticizing Iran at a conference in Poland. \u201cWe grew up talking about the Israel-Palestine issue as the most important issue. \u2026 But then, at a later stage, we saw a bigger challenge, we saw a more toxic one\u2014in fact the more toxic one in our history\u2014that came from the Islamic Republic,\u201d said the Bahraini foreign minister. (The clip was quickly taken down.)\n\nHaving a common enemy is one thing. Admitting that you\u2019re friends is another. This distinction was clear in June when Israel announced a partnership with the UAE to combat the coronavirus, which Emirati officials quickly doused with cold water.\n\nArab governments may not care all that much about the plight of the Palestinians anymore, but their citizens do, and today\u2019s announcement would not have happened if the Israeli government had gone ahead with plans to annex large portions of the West Bank on July 1. In June, the UAE\u2019s influential ambassador to the U.S., Yousef al-Otaiba, took the unusual step of publishing an op-ed in Hebrew in an Israeli newspaper warning that annexation would be a setback in efforts to improve relations between the two countries. Today\u2019s announcement notes that \u201cat the request of President Trump \u2026 Israel will suspend declaring sovereignty over areas outlined in the President\u2019s Vision for Peace.\u201d\n\nOne group that will not be happy about this is the Israeli far-right, which cares about the settlements far more than relations with the UAE. Some officials are already emphasizing that the annexation announcement has only been suspended rather than abandoned.\n\nFor Palestinians, this probably won\u2019t change all that much, other than underlining the already known fact that many of their regional allies are growing weary of the Palestinian issue. It will also be another blow to the already rickety two-state solution framework for Middle East peace if the Arab governments that have supported it move on.\n\nFor Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this is a much-needed win at a time when he\u2019s facing large public protests over corruption allegations, the state of the economy, and his handling of the coronavirus. While not as symbolically important for his supporters as annexation, it\u2019s also a lot less risky and controversial. This may have been the best possible outcome for him, politically.\n\nAs for Trump, the deal may not actually do that much to shore up his pro-Israel bona fides\u2014right-wing American Jews and Christian Zionists probably would have preferred annexation\u2014but he\u2019ll no doubt use it to tout himself as a deal-maker and peacemaker. Just in case you thought they might underplay this one, national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien noted in a press conference on Thursday that Trump, after all, wrote The Art of the Deal, and suggested he would eventually be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nWest Wing ego-stroking aside, it\u2019s true that suspending annexation is a concession from Israel, but the only reason annexation has been on the table at all is because there was some reason to believe Trump might support it, including the \u201cVision for Peace,\u201d the Jared Kushner\u2013masterminded peace plan that would have eviscerated Palestinian sovereignty in the West Bank. It\u2019s another example of the approach to international diplomacy previously seen in Syria and North Korea: His rhetoric contributed to a crisis\u2014potential annexation\u2014and he\u2019s now taking credit after things return to the status quo.\n\nViewed in a vacuum, today\u2019s announcement is a significant development. Viewed as the main, perhaps sole, outcome of Trump and Kushner\u2019s efforts to reach the \u201cultimate deal\u201d for Middle East peace, it looks pretty paltry.\n\nFor more of Slate\u2019s news coverage, subscribe to What Next on Apple Podcasts or listen below.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "The Winners and Losers From the Historic Israel-UAE Deal", "url": "https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/israel-uae-trump-deal.html", "description": "This is a rare diplomatic win for Trump, but let's cool it on the Nobel Peace Prize talk.", "image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/c612e0cc-1357-4364-bc43-c106c1e33e0f.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=3238x2159&offset=35x0", "site_name": "Slate Magazine", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "The Winners and Losers From the Historic Israel-UAE Deal", "description": "This is a rare diplomatic win for Trump, but let's cool it on the Nobel Peace Prize talk.", "image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/c612e0cc-1357-4364-bc43-c106c1e33e0f.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=3238x2159&offset=35x0", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@slate"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T19:07:45.050Z", "tag": "middle-east, israel, palestine, foreign-policy, donald-trump", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "description": "This is a rare diplomatic win for Trump, but let's cool it on the Nobel Peace Prize talk.", "news_keywords": "middle-east, israel, palestine, foreign-policy, donald-trump", "author": "Joshua Keating", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Slate", "application-name": "Slate", "msapplication-TileColor": "#660033", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://slate.com/media/sites/slate-com/icon.144x144.png", "theme-color": "#2c0022", "dfp-cache-buster": "7b1b9fb6f55280c03edfe3d6def54723514811de"}}}
