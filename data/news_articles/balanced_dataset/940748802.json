A beautiful, intelligent child, she always had a passion for the arts, and in particular music, studying the violin under Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe, dubbed \u2018The King of the Violin\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrincess Marie-Jos\u00e9 (centre) with her mother, Queen Elisabeth and father, King Albert I whilst on a skiing holiday in St Moritz, 1928 AP / Shutterstock\n\nDuring the First World War, she was sent to the UK to study in an Essex convent, before moving to Florence, Italy to study at an all-girls boarding school, College of the Santissima Annunziata. It was during her time here that she first met her future husband, Crown Prince Umberto of Italy, Prince of Piedmont, who she had been promised to since her childhood, after a marriage was arranged by their parents. Indeed, her marriage prospects had been widely written about and speculated on throughout her youth, being one of the few daughters of a reigning Royal Family, with many now abolished.\n\nRead next New portraits of Princess Anne released to mark her 70th birthday New portraits of Princess Anne released to mark her 70th birthday The Queen\u2019s only daughter was captured at her Gloucestershire home, Gatcombe Park\n\nThe couple were wed in 1908 in a fairytale ceremony - the beautiful Princess and the dashing Prince - at Pauline Chapel at the Quirinal Palace in Rome, Italy. Yet the day did not get off to a good start. Defying superstition, Umberto insisted on seeing his bride ahead of the ceremony, to check everything was perfect with her dress (which he had actually helped design, too). When he discovered that the sleeves had been sewn on the wrong way, he demanded that they be changed, slowing down proceedings (they were instead removed, with white gloves worn to cover her arms).\n\nUmberto and Marie-Jos\u00e9 in 1930 Granger / Shutterstock\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was at her wedding that Marie-Jos\u00e9 first showed that she was unwilling to be cowed by Italy\u2019s facist dictator, Benito Mussolini. While her father-in-law, King Victor Emmanuel III, and the House of Savoy at large were blind to the danger he proposed to the country (and the monarchy), refusing to speak out against his racial policies amongst other things, the new Princess of Piedmont stood up to him - refusing to sign her name on the wedding register as the more Italian sounding, \u2018Maria Giuseppina\u2019, as Mussolini had advised, signing her own name instead.\n\nDuring the Second World War, she began to plot against Mussolini, attempting to negotiate a peace with the United States behind the backs of her in-laws through a meeting with the future Pope Paul VI, and meeting regularly with anti-facist intellectuals. She made contact with opponents of the regime, including the Italian Resistance, who she supplied with both money and arms. After her death, Mussolini\u2019s son made claims that the two had actually had an affair, and in a 1993 interview she did acknowledge his strength, saying: \u2018He was a lion. I, too, am a lion. And we both feared one another.\u2019\n\nPrincess Marie-Jos\u00e9 in 1928 AP / Shutterstock\n\nWhen Adolf Hitler invaded her homeland of Belgium, she was swift to act, organising a meeting with the man himself in order to plead for better treatment of her brother, King Leopold III, who was confined to one of his castles, and his people, who were starving. Despite his refusal, he was quite impressed with her beauty, later saying she had eyes \u2018the colour of the German sky\u2019. For her part, she was not so impressed, saying later she wished she had taken a pistol to kill him, adding, \u2018I think I would have had the strength to do it.\u2019\n\nBy the time that her husband ascended to the throne on 9 May 1946, Italy was in the midst of a constitutional crisis, with the House of Savoy no longer as popular with the Italian people as it had been just a decade earlier. The couple themselves were seen as better than King Victor Emmanuel, who had stood down in their favour, but sadly the die was cast and it was too late. A referendum was set for 2 June, and the monarchy was abolished by the vote. King Umberto and Queen Marie-Jos\u00e9 had reigned for just 35 days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the abolition of the monarchy, the royal couple were exiled, and banned from returning to the country ever again (as were any male heirs - the couple had four children, one son and three daughters). They first settled in Portugal, but soon separated, with Marie-Jos\u00e9 choosing to take the children with her to Switzerland instead. Due to their Catholic upbringing, neither believed in divorce, so were never formally separated despite living apart until Umberto\u2019s death in 1983. They even still attended events together occasionally.\n\nFrom Switzerland, she spent her time pursuing her interest in the arts, even setting up a musical foundation, Fondation du Prix de Composition Reine Marie-Jos\u00e9, which still awards prizes to talented musicians to this day. She lived in Mexico for a few years with her daughter, Princess Marie-Beatrice, and her grandchildren, but died of lung cancer at a clinic in Geneva at the age of 94.\n\nThe outpouring of grief by the Italian public after her death was said by many to be what paved the way for her grandson, Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy, Prince of Venice, to be allowed to return to Italy just a year later in 2002, having never set foot on his home soil.", "METADATA": {"description": "As Victory Over Japan Day (VJ Day) approaches, marking the end of the Second World War, we look back at the life of the royal who tried to topple Italy\u2019s facist leader Mussolini", "GENERATOR": "Macromedia Dreamweaver", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Tatler", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "translucent black", "application-name": "Tatler", "theme-color": "#000", "og": {"site_name": "Tatler", "locale": "en_GB", "title": "The extraordinary life of the beautiful, and radical, last Queen of Italy", "url": "https://www.tatler.com/article/last-queen-of-italy-marie-jose", "type": "article", "article": {"publisher": 175137879195611}, "description": "From plotting against Mussolini to talking about shooting Hitler", "image": "https://ta-images.condecdn.net/image/B3bVKXW3eyQ/crop/1440/0.5235602094240838/f/gettyimages-107708090-landscape.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 242316129254646, "pages": 175137879195611}, "twitter": {"site": "@TatlerUK", "account_id": 334767152, "title": "The extraordinary life of the beautiful, and radical, last Queen of Italy", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "From plotting against Mussolini to talking about shooting Hitler", "image": "https://ta-images.condecdn.net/image/B3bVKXW3eyQ/crop/810/landscape/f/gettyimages-107708090-landscape.jpg"}, "article": {"section": "Royals", "tag": "Royals"}, "author": "Rebecca Cope", "snippet": {"image": "https://ta-images.condecdn.net/image/QO6BK7wy2Z8/crop/405/0.75/f/gettyimages-107708090-square.jpg"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
