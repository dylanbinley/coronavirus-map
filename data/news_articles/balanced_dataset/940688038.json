AP\n\n\n\nIsrael and the UAE agreed Thursday to normalise ties in a landmark US-brokered deal, only the third such accord the Jewish state has struck with an Arab nation, in which it pledged to suspend annexation of Palestinian lands.\n\n\n\nThe bombshell news was broken by US President Donald Trump, in a tweet hailing a \"HUGE breakthrough\" and a \"Historic Peace Agreement between our two GREAT friends\".\n\n\n\nEstablishing diplomatic ties between Israel and Washington's Middle East allies, including the oil-rich Gulf monarchies, has been central to Trump's regional strategy to contain Iran, also an arch-foe of Israel.\n\n\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was a \"historic day\" and would launch a \"new era\" for the Arab world and Israel.\n\n\n\nThe Palestinians strongly rejected the deal, calling it a \"betrayal\" of their cause, including their claim to Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.\n\n\n\nThey also announced they were withdrawing their ambassador from the Emirates, and demanded an emergency Arab League meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announces full diplomatic ties will be established with the United Arab Emirates, during a news conference on Thursday, Aug. 13, 2020 in Jerusalem.
