Lebanon today needs a strong government, and the Lebanese parliament and all parties must work together in this regard.\u201d\n\nThe president also welcomed the French president\u2019s invitation from Iran to join the international action group to help resolve Lebanon\u2019s problems.\n\nIn this telephone conversation, Rouhani also referred to the situation of coronavirus pandemic in countries around the world and the second wave of this disease, and emphasized the continued cooperation of countries to control the disease.\n\nThe President of France said in this phone call, \u201cOur views on the extension of the arms embargo on Iran are quite different from that of the United States, and we have made this clear to them.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Macron also noted, \u201cWe are taking steps to make the European financial system with Iran (INSTEX) more active.\u201d\n\nReferring to the situation in Lebanon after the horrific explosion in Beirut last week and his visit to Lebanon, the French president called on Iran to help resolve the Lebanese political crisis and invited Iran to join the international action group to resolve the Lebanese crisis.\n\nSource: Iranian Agencies", "METADATA": {"fb": {"app_id": 267981934036287}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"title": "US Has No Right to Use JCPOA Mechanism, Rouhani Tells Macron", "type": "article", "description": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that the United States has no right to use the mechanisms of t...", "url": "http://english.almanar.com.lb/1113345", "site_name": "Al-Manar TV Lebanon", "image": "http://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2020/04/manar-06670840015861957419-757x354.jpg"}}}}
