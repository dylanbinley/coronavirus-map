At a webinar yesterday held by the Indonesian Employers Association (APINDO), Luhut Binsar Panjaitan, the country\u2019s Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment, confirmed that Indonesia will be barring international visitors through December.\n\nAccording to CNN Indonesia, Luhut said, \u201cWe want domestic tourists to reach 70 percent [of previous levels]. The problem with foreign visitors [is] we will not accept them until the end of the year.\u201d He did not give any further details, but those comments suggest that Jakarta will extend restrictions banning all foreigners\u2014except for diplomats, aid workers, and those with work or residence permits\u2014from entering the country.\n\nThe minister said he was encouraged to see that coronavirus infections in certain destinations had fallen, paving the way for local visitors to return. \u201cWe are grateful that after two weeks the number of Covid-19 [cases] in Bali have decreased,\u201d Luhut added, before espousing an anti-science view that critics say has hampered Jakarta\u2019s pandemic response. \u201cThe governor said there were local herbs [that fight the virus] and he drank liquor made from them. Whether it\u2019s true or not, the important thing is [infection numbers] have dropped, so I support it.\u201d\n\nLuhut\u2019s words will dash the hopes of hoteliers and tourism operators in hard-hit Bali and the islands of Batam and Bintan in the Riau Archipelago. More than half of all visitors to Batam and Bintan typically come from nearby Singapore, and the Covid-19 pandemic has caused the permanent closure of the 450-room Bintan Lagoon Resort, a five-star property that operated for the past 26 years. At the same webinar, Indonesia\u2019s tourism minister Wishnutama said at least eight million Indonesians travel abroad each year, collectively spending about US$9 billion, and the government was trying to find ways to shift that spend to domestic trips.", "METADATA": {"og": {"title": "Indonesia Delays Tourism Reopening Until 2021", "site_name": "DestinAsian", "image": "https://www.destinasian.com/travel/wp-content/uploads/Bintan-Trikora-Beach-Slider.jpg", "url": "https://www.destinasian.com/blog/news-briefs/indonesia-delays-tourism-reopening-until-2021", "description": "The investment minister says borders will remain shut for at least another four months."}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.destinasian.com/blog/news-briefs/indonesia-delays-tourism-reopening-until-2021", "title": "Indonesia Delays Tourism Reopening Until 2021", "description": "The investment minister says borders will remain shut for at least another four months.", "image": "https://www.destinasian.com/travel/wp-content/uploads/Bintan-Trikora-Beach-Slider.jpg", "site": "@DestinAsian_Mag"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "DestinAsian Media Group", "description": "The investment minister says borders will remain shut for at least another four months.", "keywords": "indonesia travel,indonesia-updates,coronavirus,covid-19,travel restrictions,indonesia travel news,coronavirus news,travel news", "fb": {"app_id": 935158553232579}}}}
