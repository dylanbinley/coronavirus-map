It\u2019s one of those on the list of cp conditions I\u2019ve had. I got it from climbing into the water and then I realised my legs were hurting. My feet were very red and it went through my legs.\n\n\"You could literally see it tracking up my leg. I\u2019m at a disadvantage because it\u2019s a much shorter journey to my vital organs. That would have been a really c**** way to go,\u2019 he told BANG Showbiz.\"\n\nWhat is cellulitis?\n\nAccording to the NHS, cellulitis is a skin infection that's treated with antibiotics.
