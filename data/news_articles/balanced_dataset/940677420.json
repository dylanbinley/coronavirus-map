By ASHRAF SHAZLY (AFP)\n\n\"This is coming at the right time as the building really needs to be renovated as well as the display cases,\" said Nour.\n\nThe museum will close on September 1, with the renovations to be finished by either late next year or early 2022.\n\nThe irreplacable items have been left collecting dust in the building for years, with no air-conditioning to protect them from the scorching Sudanese temperatures.\n\nNow they will have to be carefully removed from the building and placed into underground storage to protect them from light before the work begins.\n\nHaitem el-Nour, new director of the national corporation of antiquities and museums says the facelift is coming at the right time to help save the antiquities. By ASHRAF SHAZLY (AFP)\n\nWhen the museum reopens, Nour hopes to be able to put on display some other treasures which have been uncovered over the past decade and never shown to the public.\n\nHe also hopes the new museum will encourage tourism in the country, which has embarked on a new path since last year shaking off 30 years of iron-fisted rule under dictator Omar al-Bashir.", "METADATA": {"title": "Rundown Sudan National Museum to get face-lift", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1", "description": "Sudan National Museum, which houses thousands of priceless antiquities dating back millennia, is to be closed for lengthy renovations after years of neglect, its director told AFP.", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@modernghanaweb", "title": "Rundown Sudan National Museum to get face-lift", "description": "Sudan National Museum, which houses thousands of priceless antiquities dating back millennia, is to be closed for lengthy renovations after years of neglect, its director told AFP.", "creator": "@modernghanaweb", "image": {"src": "https://cdn.modernghana.com/images/content/afp_these_statues_guard_the_entrance_to_the_sudan_national_in_kh.jpg"}, "domain": "www.modernghana.com"}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Modern Ghana", "title": "Rundown Sudan National Museum to get face-lift", "url": "https://www.modernghana.com/news/1022810/rundown-sudan-national-museum-to-get-face-lift.html", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.modernghana.com/images/content/afp_these_statues_guard_the_entrance_to_the_sudan_national_in_kh.jpg", "alt": "These statues guard the entrance to the Sudan National in Khartoum which is to get a face-lift after years of neglect.
