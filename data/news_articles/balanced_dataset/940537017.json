Israel frequently closes crossings in response to rocket fire and violence along the border.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTelegram\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nSkype\n\nPrint\n\nPocket\n\nWhatsApp\n\nMore\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "uw2qPv_daOnUudnLcO6hjVitB8h5oyN0ua07c8ir0ws", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/naija247news.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cropped-InstaLogo.jpg?fit=512%2C512&ssl=1", "width": 512, "height": 512}, "type": "article", "title": "Israel responds to continued incendiary balloon attacks from Gaza", "url": "https://naija247news.com/2020/08/13/israel-responds-to-continued-incendiary-balloon-attacks-from-gaza/", "description": "Gaza City/Tel Aviv, Aug. 13, 2020 Israel on Thursday struck Hamas targets overnight in Gaza1 in response to incendiary balloons launched into Southern Israel from the Gaza Strip, the army said.
