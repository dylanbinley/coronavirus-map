In the A Place at the Table, food from two different countries helps tell a story of a friendship between two first-generation American girls and their immigrant households.\n\nThe book is centered around two characters: Sara, a Pakistani American Muslim girl, and Elizabeth, a British Jewish girl who meet in a South Asian cooking class. Sara attends the class because her mom is the cooking teacher, and Elizabeth attends because her mom stopped cooking at home. The girls bond over food while both of their moms prepare for the U.S. citizenship test.\n\nThe book is written in both of their perspectives, so readers are able to step into each characters\u2019 shoes.\n\nThe girls explore what it\u2019s like to live in America as children of immigrants while they learn about friendship and adjust to America alongside their families. As their friendship is bonded by similarities as first-generation Americans, Sara and Elizabeth experience what it\u2019s like to see injustice, Islamophobia, cultural and language barriers at a young age. The book also reveals Elizabeth\u2019s struggles with her mom\u2019s depression.\n\n\u201cWhen families, especially immigrant families, are in the kitchen together, that\u2019s when the stories come out,\u201d co-author Laura Shovan told Publishers Weekly.\n\n\ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\ud83c\udf89 Happy #BookBirthday to A PLACE AT THE TABLE by @LauraShovan and @SaadiaFaruqi! You can celebrate with the authors at @TheIvyBookshop tonight \u2013 register here: https://t.co/afK8VlBs2w!\u201d pic.twitter.com/Auf8yR4xIV \u2014 HMH Kids (@HMHKids) August 11, 2020\n\nShovan partnered with Saadia Faruqi to co-write a book about two girls, who have more in common than they think.\n\nFaruqi is most-known for her children-series that began with Meet Yasmin, a book about a Pakistani American girl and her multi-generational family. She said she was inspired to write this series because her daughter mentioned that fictional characters don\u2019t look like her.\n\nOn the last day of my school being open, ALL of my Yasmin books were checked out (I rarely have them in because everyone loves them so much). I ordered one for my own daughter to read! It was perfect for right now, since it\u2019s a story about anxiety! \u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/H9RFbuhj2Z \u2014 Haisley Library (@haisley_library) May 18, 2020\n\nIn a conversation with Shovan published in Publishers Weekly, Faruqi talked about how she resonates with the character Sara because she knows the many issues immigrant families face. She is an immigrant herself, and her children are the first-generation Americans in her family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting being a part of a family that is similar in terms of culture but different in terms of belonging,\u201d Faruqi said, according to Publishers Weekly. \u201cAs immigrants who came to America in adulthood, my husband and I have so many memories of Pakistan intertwined into our psyches that my children don\u2019t have. At the same time, my kids have a sense of belonging to the U.S. that\u2019s hard for us to wrap our minds around.\u201d\n\nFaruqi said she wanted to explore this dichotomy in A Place at the Table, so she could discuss the experiences and problems that immigrant families experience together.\n\nShovan also discussed how the character Elizabeth is \u201csemi-autobiographical\u201d because it covers a lot of what she experienced as a child of immigrant parents.\n\nFaqruqi and Shovan shared their journey in co-writing the novel as a learning experience of each other\u2019s cultures, which can be similar to Sara and Elizabeth\u2019s learning experience of each other.\n\n\u201cI remember our editor, Jennifer Greene, saying that food is often a person\u2019s first experience with a culture that\u2019s new to them. In A Place at the Table, Elizabeth is so hungry to connect with her family [and] friends,\u201d said Shovan in Publishers Weekly. \u201cBy contrast, it takes Sara time to believe that anyone is interested in what her family eats, let alone in her as a person.\u201d\n\nFaruqi noted that Americans only think some different cultures are cool. In an interview with Religion News Service, Faruqi said, \u201cIn America, someone who has a British accent is cool. If you have a Pakistani accent, you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nFaruqi also uses her books to teach more about interfaith, according to RNS.\n\nIn the novel A Place at the Table, Sara and Elizabeth come together and make a dish that combines both of their Muslim and Jewish backgrounds, exploring the themes of food, friendship, and immigration.\n\n\u201cWhen we cook with children, we\u2019re teaching them more than a family recipe. They are receiving history, oral traditions, and cultural pride,\u201d Shovan said in an interview with Publishers Weekly.\n\n(editor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this story said A Place at the Table is the first in a book series. It is actually a stand alone. We apologize for the error).\n\nAsAmNews has Asian America in its heart. We\u2019re an all-volunteer effort of dedicated staff and interns.
