Turkey\u2019s unilateral decisions on oil exploration are causing tensions. These must end in order to allow a peaceful dialogue between neighboring countries and allies within NATO,\u201d Macron tweeted on Wednesday in French and in Greek.\n\nIn the meantime, the defense forces of France and Greece launched joint military exercises in the eastern Med to the south of the Greek island of Crete, while Macron urged Brussels last month to impose sanctions against Turkey for what he calls \u201cviolation of sovereignty\u201d in the disputed waters.\n\nTurkey is planning to issue gas exploration and drilling licenses in the region between the Greek island of Crete and Cyprus. However, French Total is one of the prominent companies that signed a contract with Cyprus for searching and drilling eastern Med gas, but it suspended the operations in the region over the tensions.\n\nAn extraordinary meeting of the bloc\u2019s foreign affairs ministers will be convened on Friday to discuss the dispute between Greece and Turkey in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\n\u201cThere is a strong incentive for most of the parties in the region to contain the present escalation and find an off-ramp to the crisis. The danger of miscalculation or an accident sending the conflict in a direction no one intends is rising to an unprecedented level,\u201d Prof. Michael Tanchum, a senior fellow at the Austrian Institute of European and Security Policy (AIES), told Arab News.\n\nAnkara, whose relations with Paris have already been undermined over the Libyan conflict, is determined to make no concession over its drilling activities in the region.\n\nBut it also keeping the door open for dialogue.\n\n\u201cTurkey wants to resolve its disagreement with Greece over energy exploration in the eastern Mediterranean through dialogue,\u201d Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said on Wednesday. He added: \u201cWe want to reach political solutions through peaceful means in line with the international laws.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tanchum, both Turkey and Greece now have a good measure of the positions of the other relevant regional and European actors.\n\n\u201cEach has made its own calculus. While several EU actors are either neutral or slightly leaning toward Turkey, any further action by Ankara would turn the EU unanimously against Turkey,\u201d he said.\n\nTanchum suggests that a third party needs to play an active role in defusing the current stand-off between Turkey and Greece.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the most hopeful sign now is the constructive efforts of the United States to achieve a cease-fire and perhaps buffer zone in Libya. The de-linking of flashpoints is necessary and the progress in Libya can create an opening for the EU\u2019s Foreign Affairs Council emergency meeting tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is a window now for a face-saving climbdown. But that opportunity will need to be introduced by a third party with sufficient vision, diplomatic skill and commitment.\u201d\n\nA recent maritime deal signed between Greece and Egypt has also angered Ankara.\n\nAccording to Gabriel Mitchell, director of external relations and policy fellow at the Israeli Institute for Regional Foreign Policies (Mitvim), it is difficult to imagine the EU delivering a statement that is substantially different from previous statements it has made on the issue \u2014 essentially supporting Greek sovereignty and calling for the parties to engage in direct negotiations.\n\n\u201cEU member states are relatively divided on this issue and how best to approach it,\u201d he told Arab News.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Greece and the US \u2014 Nikos Dendias and Mike Pompeo \u2014 will meet in Vienna on Friday to discuss tensions in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nMitchell thinks that this will be an important opportunity for the US to reaffirm its support for Greece and call the parties to the negotiating table.\n\n\u201cBut with everything that is going on, both globally and domestically, it is hard to say whether Pompeo can offer much more. Greece will likely need to rely on a combination of regional, European and American support. Still, a strong, declarative statement by Pompeo would likely be enough to halt the current escalation in the Eastern Mediterranean,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough both Athens and Ankara have declared their desire for direct negotiations, Mitchell considers that each side is at the same time trying to strengthen its position against the other and score some domestic points.\n\n\u201cThis increases the risk that one or more Eastern Mediterranean actors miscalculate the other side, and there is an accidental or unintentional escalation,\u201d he said.\n\n", "METADATA": {"description": "ISTANBUL: In the face of French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s commitment to send temporary military reinforcements to the eastern Med, the region could turn into a scene of escalating disputes.
