It is also where the majority of European migration-related funding ends up materialising, in the form of job creation programmes, awareness raising campaigns about the risks of irregular migration, a nd efforts to dismantle powerful trafficking networks.\n\nProgress* is one of the beneficiaries. When TNH met her she was full of smiles, but at 26 years old, she has already been through a lot. After being trafficked at 17 and forced into sex work in Libya, she had a child whose father later died in a shipwreck trying to reach Europe. Progress returned to Nigeria, but couldn\u2019t escape the debt her traffickers expected her to pay. Seeing little choice, she left her child with her sister and returned to Libya.\n\nMultiple attempts to escape spiralling violence in the country ended in failure. Once, she was pulled out of the water by Libyan fishermen after nearly drowning. Almost 200 other people died in that wreck. On two other occasions, the boat she was in was intercepted and she was dragged back to shore by the EU-supported Libyan Coast Guard.\n\nAfter the second attempt, she registered for the IOM voluntary return programme. \u201cI was hoping to get back home immediately, but Libyans put me in prison and obliged me to pay to be released and take the flight,\u201d she said.\n\nBack in Benin City, she took part in a business training programme run by IOM. She couldn\u2019t provide the paperwork needed to launch her business and finally found support from Pathfinders Justice Initiative \u2013 one of the many local NGOs that has benefited from EU funding in recent years.\n\nShe eventually opened a hairdressing boutique, but coronavirus containment measures forced her to close up just as she was starting to build a regular clientele. Unable to provide for her son, now seven years old, she has been forced to send him back to live with her sister.\n\nProgress isn\u2019t the only returnee struggling due to the impact of the pandemic. Mobility restrictions and the shuttering of non-essential activities \u2013 due to remain until early August at least \u2013 have \u201cexacerbated returnees\u2019 existing psychosocial vulnerabilities\u201d, an IOM spokesperson said.\n\nThe Edo State Task Force to Combat Human Trafficking, set up by the local government to coordinate prosecutions and welfare initiatives, is trying to ease the difficulties people are facing by distributing food items. As of early June, the task force said it had reached 1,000 of the more than 5,000 people who have returned to the state since 2017.\n\n\u2018Sent here to die\u2019\n\nJennifer, 39, lives in an unfinished two-storey building also in Benin City. When TNH visited, her three-year-old son, Prince, stood paralysed and crying, and her six-year-old son, Emmanuel, ran and hid on the appartment\u2019s small balcony. \u201cIt\u2019s the German police,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cThe kids are afraid of white men now.\u201d\n\nJennifer, who preferred that only her first name is published, left Edo State in 1999. Like many others, she was lied to by traffickers, who tell young Nigerian women they will send them to Europe to get an education or find employment but who end up forcing them into sex work and debt bondage.\n\nIt took a decade of being moved around Europe by trafficking rings before Jennifer was able to pay off her debt. She got a residency permit and settled down in Italy for a period of time. In 2016, jobless and looking to get away from an unstable relationship, she moved to Germany and applied for asylum.\n\nHer application was not accepted, but deportation proceedings against her were put on hold. That is until June 2019, when 15 policemen showed up at her apartment. \u201cThey told me I had five minutes to check on my things and took away my phone,\u201d Jennifer said.\n\nThe next day she was on a flight to Nigeria with Prince and Emmanuel. When they landed, \u201cthe Nigerian Immigration Service threw us out of the gate of the airport in Lagos, 20 years after my departure\u201d. she said.\n\nNine months after being deported, Jennifer is surviving on small donations coming from volunteers in Germany. It\u2019s the only aid she has received. \u201cThere\u2019s no job here, and even my family is ashamed to see me, coming back empty-handed with two kids,\u201d she said.\n\nJennifer, like other deportees TNH spoke to, was aware of the support system in place for people who return through IOM, but felt completely excluded from it. The deportation and lack of support has taken a heavy psychological toll, and Jennifer said she has contemplated suicide. \u201cI was sent here to die,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018The vicious circle of trafficking\u2019\n\nWithout a solid economic foundation, there\u2019s always a risk that people will once again fall victim to traffickers or see no other choice but to leave on their own again in search of opportunity.\n\n\u201cWhen support is absent or slow to materialise \u2013 and this has happened also for Libyan returnees \u2013 women have been pushed again in the hands of traffickers,\u201d said Ruth Evon Odahosa, from the Pathfinders Justice Initiative.\n\nIOM said its mandate does not include deportees, and various Nigerian government agencies expressed frustration to TNH about the lack of European interest in the topic. \u201cThese deportations are implemented inhumanely,\u201d said Margaret Ngozi Ukegbu, a zonal director for the National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons.\n\nThe German development agency, GIZ, which runs several migration-related programmes in Nigeria, said their programming does not distinguish between returnees and deportees, but the agency would not disclose figures on how many deportees had benefited from its services.\n\nDespite the amount of money being spent by the EU, voluntary returnees often struggle to get back on their feet. They have psychological needs stemming from their journeys that go unmet, and the businesses started with IOM seed money frequently aren\u2019t sustainable in the long term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crucial that, upon returning home, migrants can get access to skills acquisition programmes, regardless of the way they returned, so that they can make a new start and avoid falling back in the vicious circle of trafficking,\u201d Maria Grazie Giammarinaro, the former UN\u2019s special rapporteur on trafficking in persons, told TNH.\n\nYOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE\n\nFG Spends N1.57trn On Debt Servicing, N1.61trn On Personnel, Pension\n\nTHE Federal Government on Thursday disclosed that it had expended N1.57 trillion on debt servicing and N1.61 trillion on personnel and pensions in the current year.
