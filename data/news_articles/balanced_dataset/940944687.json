As a close US ally, the country falls under the protection of Washington\u2019s so-called nuclear umbrella.\n\nOn August 6, 1945, American B-29 bomber Enola Gay dropped its atomic payload over the port city at 8:15 a.m. local time, ultimately killing 140,000 people. The bombing utterly destroyed almost everything within 10 square kilometers in the downtown area. Many died immediately while others succumbed to their injuries or radiation-related illnesses weeks, months, and years later.\n\nThree days later, a second nuclear attack on Nagasaki killed another 70,000 people.\n\nOn August 9, 1945, a B-29 bomber Bockscar dropped a 4.5-ton plutonium bomb dubbed \u201cFat Man\u201d on Nagasaki. The bombing resulted in the obliteration of the city and the death of more than 70,000 of its residents.\n\nAfter the first bombing, Harry Truman, the then US president, told the Japanese to \"expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.\u201d\n\nThe US, which claims to be against the weapons of mass destruction despite continuing to renovate and upgrade its nuclear arsenal, has never apologized for its most horrendous crime.\n\nUS leaders have even justified the bombings, claiming that they in fact helped bring the war to a stop and prevented more deaths and destruction.\n\n\"It is indeed an irony that the Japanese have been deprived of the right to bring to justice the perpetrators of atomic terrorism against them during World War II,\" Tehran-based Kayhan International newspaper wrote last week.\n\n\"Wonder, why the Japanese government and the Japanese people remain tight-lipped towards these and other ghastly crimes against their country, when the fact of the matter is that on the night of March 9, 1945, four months before the nuclear attack, the US launched one of the most murderous and horrifying bombing campaigns in the history of the world.\"\n\nAccording to the paper, that night started the several weeks-long wave-upon-wave of firebombing and napalm attacks on more than 60 Japanese cities, adding the resulted deaths in those towns and cities eclipse the total deaths in both atomic bombings by several magnitudes.\n\n\"According to reliable accounts, the total dead from the US bombing of Japan was more than a million civilians dead, but unfortunately, the US has forced the Japanese to keep their mouths shut on these crimes against humanity,\" the paper wrote.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "og": {"site_name": "PressTV", "title": "Emperor voices 'remorse' for Japan's past; mum on US A-bombing", "type": "video", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Japanese Emperor Naruhito marks 75th year of his nation", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.presstv.com/Photo/2020/8/15/a05734fd-a6ec-474a-8410-7e4b47d891ec.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn.presstv.com/Photo/2020/8/15/a05734fd-a6ec-474a-8410-7e4b47d891ec.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 360, "type": "image/jpg"}}, "title": "Emperor voices 'remorse' for Japan's past; mum on US A-bombing", "description": "Press TV is an Iranian state-controlled news and documentary network that broadcasts in the English and French-language.
