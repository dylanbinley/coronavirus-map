Among them, the name of Dr. Oba Otudeko rings a special bell.\n\nThough he started out in the banking sector, he is now a notable personality in the manufacturing sector, creating thousands of jobs along the value chain and improving local production for the country.\n\nThis week on Nairametrics\u2019 founders profile, we bring you Obafunke Otudeko\u2019s life achievements and how he has attained such heights.\n\nEarly life\n\nAyoola Obafunke Otudeko was born into a royal family on August 18, 1943, in Odogbolu, present-day Ogun state. This perhaps explains why close friends sometimes jokingly refer to him as \u201cthe only Oba without a palace.\u201d\n\nHe had his early education at St. John\u2019s School, Oke Agbo, Ijebu-Igbo in Ogun State, and Olivet Baptist High School, Oyo, before he travelled out to study Accountancy in Leeds College of Commerce, Yorkshire, UK.\n\nAfter returning to Nigeria, Otudeko took a bank employment as a clerk in the defunct Co-operative Bank, Ibadan. Over the next two decades, he moved through the ranks to become the General Manager and acting Chief Executive Officer of the Bank. He voluntarily retired from the bank in 1983 and was appointed a Director to the Board of the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nHis foray into the business world\n\nHaving a mother who was a businesswoman, Otudeko always knew he would someday go into business. His retirement from the bank gave him the time to pursue this interest.\n\nIt was at this time that Honeywell Enterprises started off as a trading enterprise, importing and marketing commodities between the northern and southern states of Nigeria in the 1970s. The company later grew into Honeywell Group, one of Nigeria\u2019s leading indigenous conglomerates.\n\nTo sharpen his business skills, he took several courses from several international institutions, which include the International Institute for Management Development, Switzerland, Harvard Business School, Boston, USA, Hult International Business School, and Arthur D. Little School of Management, USA.\n\nHis many businesses\n\nFrom a flour mill, the Honeywell Group has evolved into a conglomerate with different subsidiaries in different sectors of the economy.\n\nHOGL Energy Limited is in the oil and gas sector, and was incorporated in 1995. As an indigenous oil and gas marketing company. The company procures, imports, and distributes fuels and gases, as well as lubricants which it produces for industrial and domestic uses.\n\nHoneywell Flour Mills Plc is a food processing company focused on flour-based products including baking flour, ball foods, noodles and pasta.

Following the alleged failure of the firms to liquidate the loans, it fell on him to pay the debts.\n\nThe bank, therefore, asked for \u201ca receiving order against estate, funds, investment, shares or other interests of the debtor, principally in Siloam Global Services Limited and in Honeywell Group Limited; Honeywell Flour Mills Plc; Anchorage Leisures Limited; Honeywell Oil and Gas Limited; Uraja Real Estate Limited; Broadview Engineering Limited; Uraja Power Solutions Limited; Honeywell Energy Resources Limited; Hudson Power Limited; Pivot Engineering Limited and Pavillion Technology Limited, which interest is held either directly or through the said Siloam Global Services Limited and/or in any other company within and outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIt also asked for leave to appropriate or utilise the \u201cinvestments, shares or other interests of the debtor (Otudeko) in all the companies listed above and in any other company/corporate entity in Nigeria or outside Nigeria in partial or full satisfaction of the debt due.\u201d\n\nAmong its prayers, Ecobank wants the court to order Otudeko to immediately avail it his \u201cstatement of affairs, statement of net worth and other credible financial details requisite and in furtherance to the Bankruptcy Act.\u201d\n\nOtudeko through his counsel, filed a preliminary objection, urging the court to either dismiss/strike out the suit or stay proceedings \u201cin deference to arbitration.\u201d\n\nHe described the suit as an abuse of court processes, contending that it was filed in gross violation of Section 7(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy (Proceedings) Rules Cap B2, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2010.\n\nThe case is still in court.\n\nOther services\n\nIn 2003, Oba Otudeko established a non- governmental organisation called Oba Otudeko Foundation (OOF) as an official vehicle to carry out his philanthropic acts.
