France also deployed two fighter planes to Crete.\n\nFrench relations with Turkey, which is not an EU member, are already bad over Ankara's involvement in Libya's civil war.\n\nRelations between historic regional rivals \u2014 and nominal NATO allies \u2014 Greece and Turkey have hit a more than two-decade low after Turkey sent a seismic research ship, escorted by warships, to prospect Monday for potential offshore oil and gas in waters Athens claims as its own.\n\nGreece placed its armed forces on high alert and sent warships to the spot, south of Turkey between Crete and the island nation of Cyprus, demanding the vessels' withdrawal. Turkey claims it has every right to prospect in the area, as well as in neighboring waters Cyprus considers its own, after the discovery of large offshore gas deposits in recent years off Israel, Egypt and Cyprus.", "METADATA": {"keywords": "wire, dcc, general news, government and politics, seismology, earth science, science, foreign policy, international relations, government policy, oil and gas industry, energy industry, business, international incidents", "news_keywords": "wire, dcc, general news, government and politics, seismology, earth science, science, foreign policy, international relations, government policy, oil and gas industry, energy industry, business, international incidents", "description": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 European Union foreign ministers were holding urgent talks Friday on military tensions between Greece and Turkey as the neighboring countries' navies continued a game of brinkmanship", "author": "NICHOLAS PAPHITIS and SUZAN FRASER Associated Press", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=441519593", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.elkodaily.news", "googlebot": "noarchive", "google-site-verification": "ajIqbfHKqqHmTWWTpWMqbhC52W27D5M1xTL44a5ZXCU", "msvalidate.01": "106560791A6200A80BCECBE5E23A2EA2", "y_key": "PRah6gnV34E7FNluCkd0BOm4bVhTShpfdHje8j8ERnO4zik1QdfubwS2da8_bXeYow--", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://elkodaily.com/news/world/eu-holding-urgent-talks-on-greece-turkey-energy-dispute/article_d4e4dcbe-0ce9-59f1-9e39-c740466d1801.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/elkodaily.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/52/6528fc1c-2bb8-514f-91b6-887f905ef615/5f366bad8b11c.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C992%2C0%2C91&resize=1120%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "width": 1120, "height": 630}, "title": "EU holding urgent talks on Greece-Turkey energy dispute", "description": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 European Union foreign ministers were holding urgent talks Friday on military tensions between Greece and Turkey as the neighboring countries' navies continued a game of brinkmanship", "site_name": "Elko Daily Free Press", "section": "World"}, "fb": {"app_id": 136428783038289, "pages": 127993293932724}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/elkodaily/"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@elkodaily", "image": {"alt": "EU holding urgent talks on Greece-Turkey energy dispute"}}, "parsely-title": "EU holding urgent talks on Greece-Turkey energy dispute", "parsely-link": "https://elkodaily.com/news/world/greek-fm-heads-for-vienna-talks-amid-standoff-with-turkey/article_d4e4dcbe-0ce9-59f1-9e39-c740466d1801.html", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-08-14T09:50:45-0700", "parsely-post-id": "d4e4dcbe-0ce9-59f1-9e39-c740466d1801", "parsely-image-url": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/elkodaily.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/52/6528fc1c-2bb8-514f-91b6-887f905ef615/5f366bad8b11c.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C992%2C0%2C91&resize=1120%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "parsely-author": "NICHOLAS PAPHITIS and SUZAN FRASER Associated Press", "parsely-section": "World", "parsely-tags": "wire, dcc, general news, government and politics, seismology, earth science, science, foreign policy, international relations, government policy, oil and gas industry, energy industry, business, international incidents, ap"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
