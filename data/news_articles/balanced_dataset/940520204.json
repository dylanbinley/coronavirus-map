Now, there is a surprising new buzzword\u2014undertourism.\n\nVirtuoso\u2019s Under One Sky event shined a light on the perils of undertourism and the economic and conservation disaster it is leaving in its wake.\n\nIn his introductory address, Virtuoso chairman and CEO, Matthew Upchurch, noted that global sustainability leader Costas Christ made a prophetic statement in 2009 when speaking on the topic of overtourism. Christ suggested that \u201cif there was some magic switch that you could stop travel dead in its tracks, it could end up being the greatest conservation disaster on the planet.\u201d\n\nAnd that is just what we are faced with now, said Upchurch.\n\n\u201cSustainability isn\u2019t just about the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also about the preservation of natural and cultural heritage and benefitting local economies. Travel can be a force for good, and we should all play a part in amplifying that mission.\u201d\n\nUpchurch also noted that health security will be paramount for some time and predicted that some of the early recovery long-haul travelers will be those who travel for a \u201cdeeper purpose to connect with nature, culture and meaningful experiences.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can take a leadership position, one that I promise you that can and will be profitable,\u201d he said.\n\nThis year, Under One Sky illustrated how profit and purpose go hand in hand.\n\n\u201cUndertourism shows us why sustainability was never just about the environment alone but also about the benefit of sustainable travel to local economies and their role in conservation,\u201d said Jessica Upchurch, TKT title. \u201cThere is hope. We have seen how quickly nature can regenerate herself. This global time out has given us proof positive but it has also shown us the dangers of undertourism.\n\nJennifer Upchurch, Virtuoso's sustainability ambassador called for a \u2018conscious comeback,\u2019 that combines what is good for the planet with what\u2019s good for the people.\n\n\u201cWe realize the financial realities and pain felt by our friends throughout the industry but that pain is also having a few positive outcomes like the retirement of aging aircraft and ships, which had a significant negative impact on the environment.\u201d\n\nJoel Makower, chairman and executive editor Greenbiz Group, Inc., spoke on how companies practicing environmental social and governmental practices ESGs can be more profitable than companies that do not.\n\n\"For years, Wall Street didn\u2019t get sustainability, they saw it as some fringe thing that was nice to do\u2026but that\u2019s changed in the last few years. In fact, sustainability has moved from the margins to the mainstream for a very fundamental reason. Wall Street finally figured out that sustainability is a proxy for good management and growth and innovation. The companies that are rate wealth from a sustainability perspective and ESG actually do better in the market. The sustainability funds are proving that. Over the last couple of quarters, the market basket of sustainability funds outperformed the S&P 500 and other standard indices of stock performance.\u201d\n\nTo put it simply, Makower noted that it comes down to risk.\n\n\u201cWall Street finally realized that companies are sustainability leaders have better risk profiles,\u201d he said.\n\nThe exciting part is that companies realize that a new sustainability model gives them the opportunity for innovation.\n\n\u201cThere is a vast outpouring of new technology, new ideas, new business models of how you provide these services to the world that not only doesn\u2019t harm the world but actually helps,\u201d he said.\n\nWe are looking at a critical reset. We are rethinking how we look at problems and solutions.\n\n\u201cWhat is possible? How do we take some of these huge wicked problems in the world and address them proactively,\u201d said Makower. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge opportunity for business to become part of the solution and prosper in the process.\u201d\n\nCompanies that are leading the way are asking \u201cwhat would it take?\u201d\n\nTourism Australia recently took a step forward in putting a priority on sustainability in the creation of the role of head of sustainability, to which Penny Rafferty, was appointed at Tourism Australia.\n\nRafferty points out that a sustainability legacy is at the core of many of the top experiences and top companies within Australia.\n\nOur role is to advocate, storytelling and educate,\u201d she said. \u201cNow more than ever, while we know that there is this intention in people who want to travel better, we are hoping there is a resonance with that.\u201d\n\nShowing leadership can make sustainable practices something that comes more naturally.\n\n\u201cThere is an increasing acknowledgment in the business world that if you put business purpose and positive measures of impact as well as profit on the same page, the real success stories are the ones that have a clear purpose and positive impact,\u201d said Rafferty.\n\nRafferty suggests moving away from measuring success in tourism by growth.\n\n\u201cThere are other metrics that have to be factored in,\u201d she said.\n\n&Beyond showcased a case study that demonstrates how a sustainable business can operate an impressive balance sheet.\n\n\u201cWe have very happy guests, we are getting a return on our investment and the profit side of our balance sheet is doing extremely well,\u201d said Joss Kent, executive chairman at &Beyond. At the same time, we have tripled our investment on the impact side, providing water; we\u2019ve built 285 classrooms; we are 99 percent plastic-free; and we\u2019ve moved lions to Rwanda\u2026so if you think you have to trade profit versus purpose, think again. They can coexist.\u201d\n\nVideo: 'Huge opportunity' to redefine how we do business, Trucost CEO says (CNBC)", "METADATA": {"civicscience": {"jspoll-hostname": "www138.civicscience.com"}, "application-name": "The Importance of Making a \u2018Conscious Comeback\u2019 to Travel", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "Travel", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Virtuoso\u2019s Under One Sky event shines a light on the perils of undertourism.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
