Evidently, he got the idea when a self-styled \u201carchbishop\u201d of a purported church in Florida explained the idea to him in a letter. And now, that very archbishop has been arrested for peddling industrial bleach as a \u201cmiracle cure.\u201d\n\nThe archbishop, Mark Grenon and his son, Joseph Grenon have been arrested in Colombia for the crime and may be extradited to the U.S. As per recent footage posted by the Attorney General\u2019s office, Mark Grenon and Joseph Grenon can be seen dressed in blue jumpsuits and masks as they are being led away by armed police.\n\nIn July 2020, the \u201carchbishop\u201d of the Genesis II \u201cchurch,\u201d as well as three of his sons, were arrested for dealing in a substance that was not medically approved for use and had the possibility of being life-threatening.\n\nIn the current case, the prosecutor\u2019s office details that the father-son pair has been arrested on suspicion of selling a \u201cmiracle solution\u201d that had resulted in the deaths of seven American citizens. For quite some, the Grenons have marketing chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleach used in textile manufacturing, as a \u201cmiracle mineral solution\u201d or MMS. They claimed that if its diluted form is ingested, every illness from COVID-19 to HIV/AIDS can be cured.\n\nGrenon had contacted Trump via a letter back in April 2020.\n\nReportedly, Grenon had written to Donald Trump in the White House and had explained how chlorine dioxide \u201ccan rid the body of Covid-19.\u201d He even encouraged the U.S. president to start using the product as it is \u201ca wonderful detox that can kill 99% of the pathogens in the body.\u201d\n\nJust a few days after the letter was dispatched, Trump promoted the idea of using disinfectant as a treatment for the virus in one of his public daily coronavirus briefings in the White House, aired on National TV. He defended his statement by saying that disinfectant \u201cknocks it (coronavirus) out in a minute. One minute!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there a way we can do something, by an injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it\u2019d be interesting to check that,\u201d he had further added.\n\nShutterstock", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "chlorine dioxide, coronavirus cure,", "fb": {"app_id": 229373533940657, "pages": 492371650790156}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Latin Times", "url": "https://www.latintimes.com/florida-church-archbishop-arrested-son-selling-bleach-miracle-cure-460792", "title": "Florida Church \u2018Archbishop\u2019 Arrested With Son For Selling Bleach As \u2018Miracle Cure\u2019", "description": "Reportedly, Grenon had written to Donald Trump in the White House and had explained how chlorine dioxide \u201ccan rid the body of Covid-19\u201d.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/2019/12/02/man-jail.jpg", "secure_url": "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/2019/12/02/man-jail.jpg", "height": 667, "width": 1000, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thelatintimes", "section": "News", "author": "Apeksha Bagchi", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T00:02:37-04:00", "published_time": "2020-08-13T00:02:37-04:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thelatintimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Florida Church \u2018Archbishop\u2019 Arrested With Son For Selling Bleach As \u2018Miracle Cure\u2019", "url": "https://www.latintimes.com/florida-church-archbishop-arrested-son-selling-bleach-miracle-cure-460792", "description": "Reportedly, Grenon had written to Donald Trump in the White House and had explained how chlorine dioxide \u201ccan rid the body of Covid-19\u201d.", "image": "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/styles/large/public/2019/12/02/man-jail.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#17323f", "msapplication-config": "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/themes/lt/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#17323f", "author": "Apeksha Bagchi", "keywords": "chlorine dioxide, coronavirus cure,", "description": "Reportedly, Grenon had written to Donald Trump in the White House and had explained how chlorine dioxide \u201ccan rid the body of Covid-19\u201d."}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
