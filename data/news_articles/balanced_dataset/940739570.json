Hopefully I won\u2019t have to wait so long to get my juicy KFC ... Mmmm more for me.\u201d\n\nRod J Pearson said the same thing happened to him and after a few photos and a complaint he \u201cended up with free KFC for a year\u201d.\n\nWhile Leboy Thompson included his own picture, saying: \u201cThat happened to me about a month ago in Lismore ... deep fried maggots\u201d.\n\nA KFC spokesperson said it was \u201cunlikely\u201d the situation happened in the restaurant pre-purchase and that the restaurant would welcome the opportunity to speak directly to the customer.\n\n\u201cKFC works closely with leading Australian forensic entomologists to understand flies to ensure our restaurant cooking and food handling practices are robust so we can keep our food safe,\u201d a statement said.\n\n\u201cTheir latest studies show that flies only deposit eggs in food with temperatures between 10 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees Celsius.\n\n\u201cWe hold our raw chicken below these temperatures and our cooked chicken well above so again, it\u2019s unlikely this situation happened pre-purchase.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately at this time of the year flies are out in force across Australia.\n\n\u201cWe urge customers to take care when leaving food uncovered during the warmer months to prevent these instances from occurring.\u201d\n\nmedia_camera Leboy Thompson posted this image on Facebook suggesting his meal was served with unwanted fly larvae.\n\nKFC also provided research from Professor James Wallman from University Of Wollongong, which states that a fly can deposit its eggs or maggots onto the food within seconds.\n\n\u201cThe effect of heat on flies and their offspring makes it unlikely that eggs or live maggots found in a cooked KFC food item were already in the product prior to purchase, and it would be impossible were the eggs or maggots still alive,\u201d Mr Wallman said.\n\nHe said it was \u201ceasy for infestation of a KFC food item to occur after purchase if left unattended, even for a short period, before the customer has a chance to consume it\u201d and consumption wouldn\u2019t harm the customer as any eggs or maggots would be killed by the human digestive system.", "METADATA": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "referrer": "origin", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/couriermail/ms-icon-70x70.png", "msapplication-square144x144logo": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/couriermail/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/couriermail/ms-icon-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/couriermail/ms-icon-310x310.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/couriermail/ms-icon-144x144.png", "robots": "noarchive", "description": "FAST food giant Kentucky Fried Chicken has released a statement after a diner made online accusations claiming her meal was covered in something other than secret herbs and spices.
