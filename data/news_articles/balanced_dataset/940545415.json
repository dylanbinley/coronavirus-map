After complaining about intrusion from the paparazzi and filing suit after several took shots of Archie in the home\u2019s backyard, they opted for a private $10 million home in the super-exclusive Santa Barbara enclave Montecito. Their neighbors include Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres, both of whom know the couple personally.\n\nThis makes both first-time homebuyers as Harry previously lived in palaces owned by his royal family and Meghan previously rented a home in L.A., and then in Toronto.\n\nTMZ reports that Winfrey suggested the private community. She owns a $90 million, 42-acre estate and DeGeneres lives in a $27 million compound.", "METADATA": {"generator": "Seriously Simple Podcasting 2.2.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.utahsvfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cropped-vfx-site-icon-270x270.jpg"}}}
