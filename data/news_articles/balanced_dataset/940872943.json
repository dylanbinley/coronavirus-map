Jon Tester and Steve Daines, and Rep. Greg Gianforte \u2013 have written letters to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy in the past two days, asking for an investigation into the box removals.\n\n\u201cI am concerned at the potential negative impact these cuts will have on mail delivery,\u201d Gianforte wrote Friday. \u201cWhile I appreciate attempts to improve efficiency, it is critical that the USPS not delay mail delivery.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve also questioned other actions taken by the Postal Service in recent weeks, that could lead to delays in mail delivery.\n\nPresident Trump said on Thursday that he opposed emergency funding for the Postal Service, which has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, because he didn\u2019t want to enable widespread mail voting in this fall\u2019s election.\n\nDaines told MTN News Friday that he wants to include funding for the Postal Service in the next Covid-19 relief bill and has been leading the charge on that issue.\n\nHowever, neither he nor Gianforte mentioned mail voting in their letters to DeJoy.\n\nWhen asked Friday whether he had concerns about the president\u2019s comments on mail voting and Postal Service funding, Daines said he\u2019d sent a \u201cvery strongly worded letter, asking questions about what\u2019s going on with the delayed service.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is to make sure that Montanans are getting reliable mail service,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a big deal, particularly for our state. \u201c\n\nTester and all 46 Democratic and Independent U.S. senators sent a letter to DeJoy earlier this week, expressing concerns about Postal Service actions that could undermine mail voting.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Montana\u2019s congressional delegation Friday continued to raise questions about U.S. Postal Service actions they feared could delay mail service in the state \u2013 including the removal of mail drop-boxes from several cities.", "brightspot.contentId": "00000173-ef58-dcf9-adf7-ef7c4a970000", "og": {"title": "MT delegation raises more questions on mail delays, drop boxes", "url": "https://www.kxlf.com/news/montana-news/mt-delegation-raises-more-questions-on-mail-delays-drop-boxes", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cf1ccc9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/0x0+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.simplemost.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F10%2F160816367_postal-carrier-e1570818788251-500x333.jpg", "url": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cf1ccc9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/0x0+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.simplemost.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F10%2F160816367_postal-carrier-e1570818788251-500x333.jpg", "secure_url": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cf1ccc9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/0x0+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.simplemost.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F10%2F160816367_postal-carrier-e1570818788251-500x333.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/png", "alt": "MT delegation raises more questions on mail delays, drop boxes"}, "description": "Montana\u2019s congressional delegation Friday continued to raise questions about U.S. Postal Service actions they feared could delay mail service in the state \u2013 including the removal of mail drop-boxes from several cities.", "site_name": "KXLF", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T23:40:06", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T23:40:06", "section": "Montana News", "tag": "Montana News"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Montana\u2019s congressional delegation Friday continued to raise questions about U.S. Postal Service actions they feared could delay mail service in the state \u2013 including the removal of mail drop-boxes from several cities.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cf1ccc9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/0x0+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.simplemost.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F10%2F160816367_postal-carrier-e1570818788251-500x333.jpg", "alt": "MT delegation raises more questions on mail delays, drop boxes"}, "site": "@kxlf", "title": "MT delegation raises more questions on mail delays, drop boxes"}, "fb": {"app_id": 488127188660184, "pages": 158213591375}, "brightspot.cached": "true", "google-site-verification": "sVZM5f9Butm2h9nPQPpmfUxZA8TI7RFDqzlunmC8WuQ"}}}
