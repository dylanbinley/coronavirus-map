approval of Iseyin-Ogbomoso road, while work is ongoing vigorously on Moniya-Iseyin road.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe joyously bring to your notice that the people of Oke-Ogun will be delighted to be identified with you in your future political pursuits because the construction of this road will bring not only accessible road to Ogbomoso, but also promote economic activities among the people of Oke-Ogun, Ibarapa, Oyo, Ogbomoso and by extension, Kwara State.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be our joy if the construction of this road commences immediately and completed in time, in view of this, your name will be etched in gold in the minds of the good people of Oke-Ogun, for being a pathfinder in the present Oyo State.\u201d\n\nThe state government recently announced the approval for the construction of Iseyin-Ogbomoso road, Alakia-Airport road, development of the Ibadan Dry Port facility and construction of Ibadan Circular road, using what it called a N100 billion private bond.\n\nVanguard
