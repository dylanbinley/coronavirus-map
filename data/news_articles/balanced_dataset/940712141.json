Today, Parimatch has expanded internationally to become a global betting and technology brand. The company now looks to build on its heritage to become the largest operator in its home market.\n\nCommenting on the signing, Sergey Portnov, CEO of Parimatch said: \u201cI would firstly like to congratulate President Zelenskyi for delivering on his pledge to legalize gambling in Ukraine. He has a shown that he is a man of his word and we fully support his agenda to liberalize the local economy. Parimatch has long argued that the development of a fair and regulated betting industry will really benefit Ukraine.\u201d\n\nParimatch\u2019s strong commitment to the market is despite further clarity and reforms being required on the existing tax system in order to create a fair landscape for operators.\n\n\u201cWe are fully committed to conquering our home market by delivering a product that can entertain the people of Ukraine. We are also proud that we can now contribute to the country\u2019s economy and help grow its technology industry. However, for us to deliver these benefits in the long-term we need a fairer tax system which is currently too punitive and uncompetitive compared to similar international markets. It is vital that this is addressed as soon as possible to ensure the enduring viability of the industry in Ukraine.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "title": "Parimatch to bid for an operating license in Ukraine", "description": "Founded in Ukraine in 1994, Parimatch was amongst the first bookmakers in the CIS region to transition into a digital betting platform.
