Corn was down 0.4% to 3.37-1/2 by 0302 GMT, after jumping 3% on Thursday.\n\nSoybeans have gained 3.4% this week, poised for the first gain in three weeks, and wheat was almost flat for the week.\n\nCorn prices surged recently after a storm potentially affected 10 million acres of farmland in Iowa, the top U.S. corn growing state, according to state authorities.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on Wednesday U.S. farmers would reap a record corn harvest and a second-biggest soybean crop, buoyed by favourable weather.\n\nThe USDA on Thursday said Chinese buyers booked deals to buy 197,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans, the seventh weekday in a row that the government has reported a sale to the world\u2019s top buyer of the oilseed.\n\nIn a separate report, the agency said weekly export sales of soybeans through Aug. 6 totalled 2.13 million tonnes, the most since November 2016.\n\nConsultancy Strategie Grains on Thursday again cut its forecast for this year\u2019s soft wheat harvest in the European Union and Britain, as poor crops in France and southeast Europe offset increased estimates for Poland and the Baltic countries.\n\nCommodity funds were net buyers of CBOT corn, soybean, soymeal and wheat futures contracts on Thursday, and net sellers of soyoil, traders said.
