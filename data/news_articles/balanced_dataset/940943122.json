It is our duty to be concerned about the youths of our state at a time when job opportunities are scarce,\" he said.\n\n\"We will put in place such a mechanism that will ensure employment to local youths on the basis of their mark- sheets of Class X and XII,\" Shivraj Singh Chouhan added.\n\nThe chief minister said that the government will work for the development of skills among the state's youths.\n\n\"For this, a skill development park, worth around Rs 600 crore, is being set up in Bhopal with the help of Singapore,\" he added.\n\nShivraj Singh Chouhan said that 15 lakh migrant labourers of Madhya Pradesh returned to the state during the coronavirus-induced- lockdown.\n\n\"Of them, the job cards of 14 lakh migrant labourers have been prepared in a bid to provide them employment near their residence,\" he said.\n\nShivraj Singh Chouhan reiterated that the state government will strongly fight the case in the court in favour of increasing the reservation of Other Backward Class (OBC) from 14 per cent to 27 per cent.\n\nHe said when he took over as the chief minister (on March 23 this year), the state had only one laboratory for COVID-19 testing and lacked other arrangements.\n\nHe said the government worked on a war footing to put in place adequate arrangements against the pandemic.\n\nMembers of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led cabinet and senior state government officials were also present at the function. The gathering was restricted amid the preventive measures for COVID-19.\n\nEarlier, Shivraj Singh Chouhan also inspected the parade.", "METADATA": {"news_keywords": "Shivraj Singh Chouhan,Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister", "description": "Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday said that preference would be given to local youths for government jobs in the state.", "section": "india", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/locals-to-get-priority-in-government-jobs-in-madhya-pradesh-shivraj-singh-chouhan-2279973", "keywords": "Shivraj Singh Chouhan,Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister", "og": {"title": "Locals To Get Priority In Government Jobs In Madhya Pradesh: Shivraj Singh Chouhan", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-03/e8pn23rg_shivraj-singh-chouhan_625x300_23_March_20.jpg", "secure_url": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-03/e8pn23rg_shivraj-singh-chouhan_625x300_23_March_20.jpg", "width": 630, "height": 473}, "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/locals-to-get-priority-in-government-jobs-in-madhya-pradesh-shivraj-singh-chouhan-2279973", "site_name": "NDTV.com", "description": "Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday said that preference would be given to local youths for government jobs in the state."}, "fb": {"app_id": 213741912058651}, "al": {"android": {"url": "ndtvSocial://com.july.ndtv/ndtv/ndtv.android/type=news/id=2279973/category=india-news", "package": "com.july.ndtv", "app_name": "NDTV"}, "ios": {"url": "ndtv://news/ndtv.com/news/view/ndtv/2279973/site=classic/", "app_store_id": 377869410, "app_name": "NDTV"}, "ipad": {"url": "ndtvhd://news/ndtv.com/news/view/ndtv/2279973/site=classic/", "app_store_id": 390847563, "app_name": "NDTV HD"}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ndtv", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/locals-to-get-priority-in-government-jobs-in-madhya-pradesh-shivraj-singh-chouhan-2279973", "title": "Locals To Get Priority In Government Jobs In Madhya Pradesh: Shivraj Singh Chouhan", "description": "Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday said that preference would be given to local youths for government jobs in the state.", "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-03/e8pn23rg_shivraj-singh-chouhan_625x300_23_March_20.jpg?ver-20200813.01", "app": {"url": {"iphone": "ndtv://news/ndtv.com/news/view/ndtv/2279973/site=classic/", "googleplay": "ndtvnews://www.ndtv.com/type=news/id=2279973/category=india-news"}, "name": {"iphone": "NDTV", "ipad": "NDTV HD", "googleplay": "NDTV"}, "id": {"iphone": 377869410, "googleplay": "com.july.ndtv"}}}, "category": "News", "theme-color": "#e3eef9", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=377869410 , app-argument=ndtv://news/ndtv.com/news/view/ndtv/2279973/site=classic/", "taboola": {"title": "Locals To Get Priority In Government Jobs In Madhya Pradesh: Shivraj Singh Chouhan"}, "publish-date": "2020-08-15T16:58:55+05:30"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
