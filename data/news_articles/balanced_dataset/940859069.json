So, yeah, it\u2019s good to be home.\u201d\n\nMeghan and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, moved to the US this year after announcing in January that they would step back from senior roles in the royal family, following a period marked by conflict with the British press over claims of intrusion and bullying.\n\nMeghan is suing Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online, over an article that reproduced parts of a \u201cprivate and confidential\u201d handwritten letter she sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018.\n\nThe Mail\u2019s lawyers argued that five of her friends revealed the letter\u2019s existence when they anonymously briefed People magazine \u2013 meaning it was already in the public domain and Thomas Markle had a right to respond and defend his reputation. The duchess has always insisted she did not authorise her friends to speak to the magazine.\n\nIt is not the first time Meghan and Prince Harry have spoken out on the protests and the Black Lives Matter movement. In July they said the Commonwealth, which grew out of the British empire and is headed by Prince Harry\u2019s grandmother the Queen, must acknowledge its colonialist past, even if it is \u201cuncomfortable\u201d.\n\nRelated: Harry and Meghan say Commonwealth \u2018must acknowledge the past\u2019\n\nMeghan\u2019s latest comments were made while she interviewed Emily Ramshaw, the co-founder and CEO of the 19th, about issues of gender in media, praising the outlet\u2019s mission.\n\nNext week marks the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment, which gave women in the US the right to vote, though millions of women of color \u2013 and particularly Black women \u2013 would continue to be denied that right for decades.\n\nAcknowledging the name of the non-profit newsroom, Meghan noted that the word \u201csuffragette\u201d had been pejorative when first used.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at that, and look through that lens of the power of one person\u2019s influence in the media to be able to shape an entire movement or way of thinking \u2026 If women had their voice heard as equally, how different that would have been.\u201d\n\nVideo: Meghan Markle believed Princess Michael of Kent\u2019s racist brooch was sending a message, book claims (FOX News)", "METADATA": {"civicscience": {"jspoll-hostname": "www138.civicscience.com"}, "application-name": "Meghan hails Black Lives Matter protests as she pledges to speak out", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "World News", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex has said she found inspiration in peaceful anti-racism protests that have taken place across the US in recent months \u2013 and now that she has returned home to California, she is looking forward to speaking out \u201cin a way that I haven\u2019t been able to of late\u201d.
