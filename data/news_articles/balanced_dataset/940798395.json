Actors Laura Linney, Julia Garner and Jason Bateman, who also executive produces the show and has directed several episodes, were joined by showrunner, writer and executive producer Chris Mundy, director Alik Sakharov, cinematographer Armando Salas and production designer David Bomba.\n\nThe show follows Marty (Bateman) and Wendy Byrde (Linney), a married couple that moves their family to Missouri to set up a large money laundering operation. They soon get mixed up in a dark world of criminal happenings and are forced to make tough choices \u2013 ones that Linney said make audiences confront their own moral solidity.\n\n\u201cI think people like identifying with the Byrdes and thinking, if they were in their situation, what would they do?\u201d Linney said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be someone of questionable character. It\u2019s not easy to be of solid character, I think. So I think people are realizing how easy it is to take the dark road.\u201d\n\nGarner, who plays Ruth Langmore, added that the imperfect nature of many characters in the show makes them more appealing to audiences.\n\n\u201cYou have all these dark, dark people, but they\u2019re still so likable because they\u2019re people, they\u2019re not just characters,\u201d she said.\n\nThe characters\u2019 darkness has typically been matched with a dark blue and cyan palette from the production side. But as the show entered Season 3, Salas said the visuals began to expand as the characters did.\n\nNatural changes in the goals set by Marty and Wendy lead to self-revelations, such as a moment where Marty sets his mind on success after deciding that being mixed up in a world of crime was no accident. These shifting mindsets led to different lighting approaches. The \u201cMissouri Belle\u201d casino boat designed by Bomba and introduced in the latest season, for example, is lit by yellow carnival lightbulbs and brass chandeliers.\n\n\u201cThere was a level of ambition and sophistication that the Byrdes were taking on, and that had to be portrayed in the photography and in the lighting,\u201d Salas said. \u201cAnd so it wasn\u2019t so much a change, it was just kind of an organic evolution of the storyline. As the characters change, as the story progresses, so does the look .\u201d\n\nBut character arcs don\u2019t always evolve; sometimes they just end.\n\nSeason 3 saw no shortage of characters to mourn, as fans said goodbye to Ben Davis (Tom Pelphrey) and Helen Pierce (Janet McTeer). Mundy said he calls actors before any outline is shared so they can hear the news from him.\n\nBateman said casting director Alexa Fogel makes it hard to deal with character deaths, since she tends to find people that fit into the cast like family.\n\n\u201cIt is amazing that Alexa Fogel is able to find us people that are as good a people as they are actors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s double torture. And she keeps doing it. We keep killing them off, and she keeps finding someone else that\u2019s going to break our hearts.\u201d\n\nThough the show takes place in Missouri, most of it was filmed in Georgia. Production was often stalled due to weather concerns. But Salas said the challenging physicality of the location provided learning opportunities and made for a bigger payout when shooting completed each day.\n\n\u201cHowever long, and hard, and difficult locations we deal with, on a show like this, you walk away with a sense of accomplishment and the stuff that you got right,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you just kind of Rolodex all the things you could\u2019ve done better to improve upon it the next time. You\u2019re dealing with Georgia summer, and the weather, and clouds, and rain, and sun every five minutes. We were shut down for lightning so many times, I lost count.\u201d\n\nIn late July, \u201cOzark\u201d earned 18 Emmy nominations for its latest season. Though the team could not celebrate in person due to the coronavirus pandemic, plenty of congratulatory texts were passed around. Bateman said he looks forward to a time when shooting starts again and everyone can properly revel in their recent success.\n\n\u201cAnd we can\u2019t wait to get in person, on the ground, with the rest of our team and our family down there, and do a big huge hug and cake,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just so proud of everybody. I\u2019m happy that everybody\u2019s watching it, but we\u2019re also thrilled to be able to make it.\u201d\n\nWatch the full Q&A below.\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
