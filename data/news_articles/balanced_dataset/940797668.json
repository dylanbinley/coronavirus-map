The city says it can help", "TEXT": "The Toronto public school board wants to create smaller elementary class sizes this fall \u2014 a key demand of parents and educators during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 but in order to do that, school reopening might have to be delayed a week, or the start-up date staggered, says the chair.\n\n\u201cWe will probably go for smaller class sizes,\u201d and a vote on the issue is scheduled for early next week, said newly elected chair Alexander Brown, the trustee for Willowdale.\n\n\u201cBut the issue is, where do we put all the kids? In my area, schools are at 100, 110 per cent capacity. We don\u2019t have any room. We need time to find space in libraries or community centres or wherever we can to set up those classes.\u201d\n\nThe city of Toronto is offering to help with extra space required to offer smaller classes, loaning use of community centres or other city buildings.\n\nOn Thursday, Education Minister Stephen Lecce announced new funding for boards\u2019 COVID costs, and also said they could dip further into their reserves to fund more staff.\n\nWhile the Toronto board is reluctant to fund all the extra staffing using reserves \u2014 it would cost about $20 million for some 200 extra teachers \u2014 it is hoping to be able to access some previously promised provincial funding to take as little as possible from its contingency fund.\n\nBut Brown said regardless of how the positions are paid for, the board needs about a week to reorganize classrooms and find space, and said the director and previous chair have had discussions with the city about moving into unused public space.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to bring in smaller class sizes for safety first, and that\u2019s what parents are telling us \u2014 they want those smaller classes, period.\u201d\n\nHowever, Brown said, \u201cif (the government) told us this about a month ago, we might have been able to do it for the start of the school year.\u201d\n\nThe Toronto District School Board\u2019s plan could see 200 teachers hired and elementary class sizes shrink to 15 to 20 students, depending on the grade. It would mean a shorter school day to accommodate teacher prep time.\n\nAfter an unrelated event Friday, Toronto Mayor John Tory told reporters the TDSB first approached the city about borrowing space about a month ago, and talks continue.\n\nSchool board officials have been \u201cnon-specific in the sense that they haven\u2019t said, as of yet, \u2018We want this community centre or that space,\u2019\u201d Tory said.\n\nThe city offer stands, Tory added, saying \u201cwe will do our very best,\u201d to help ensure kids get back to school safely.\n\nIn a formal letter sent to both TDSB and TCDSB officials Friday, Toronto Public Health repeated its earlier recommendation for smaller class sizes and that schools consider pushing back the scheduled September start date or stagger start times for students \u201cin order to allow sufficient time for public health measures to be incorporated.\u201d\n\nThe Aug. 14 letter from Dr. Eileen de Villa, the city\u2019s medical officer of health, said that while TPH is \u201cgenerally supportive\u201d of the ministry\u2019s back-to-school plan, it also made several recommendations to \u201cbuild\u201d on those measures.\n\nLoading...
