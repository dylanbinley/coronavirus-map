Though the assassins killed the Father of the Nation, they \u201ccould not wipe out the principle and ideal of this great man\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cOn the National Mourning Day, let us translate our grief into strength and devote ourselves to build \u2018Sonar Bangla\u2019 as dreamt by the Father of the Nation,\u201d the president added.\n\nIn her message, Bangabandhu\u2019s daughter Hasina said, \u201cTogether, we have to remain prepared to resist any evil-attempt by the anti-liberation communal group, and anti-development and anti-democracy forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe killers were able to assassinate Bangabandhu but they could not kill his dreams and ideals. Let the glory and ideals of the Father of the Nation\u2019s sacrifice be reflected through our actions in the Mujib Year,\u201d she said.\n\nThe prime minister urged the countrymen to turn the grief of the loss of Bangabandhu into strength and engage themselves in building a non-communal, hunger-poverty free and prosperous Bangladesh by upholding Bangabandhu\u2019s philosophy.\n\n\u201cThis should be our solemn pledge on this National Mourning Day,\u201d she said.\n\nThe programmes of the day will include placing wreaths at Bangabandhu\u2019s mural at Dhanmondi 32, the house where he was assassinated, at 6:30am. It is the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum now.\n\nSpecial prayers will be held and flowers will be placed on the graves of the victims of the carnage at Banani Graveyard at 7:30am.\n\nRecitation from the Quran will be held and wreaths will be placed at Bangabandhu\u2019s grave in Gopalganj\u2019s Tungipara at 10am. A Doa-Mahfil will also be held there.\n\nSpecial prayers will be held in mosques, temples, churches and pagodas.\n\nBangladesh Television, Bangladesh Betar and other private television and radio stations will broadcast special programmes on the day. The national dailies will publish special supplements.\n\nCatastrophe befell the fledgling nation on that night in 1975 as neither the president\u2019s 10-year-old son Sheikh Russel, nor nephew Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni\u2019s pregnant wife Arzoo Moni, could escape the massacre.\n\nBesides Moni, the others included Bangabandhu\u2019s wife Bangamata Sheikh Fazilatunnesa Mujib, brother Sheikh Naser, brother-in-law Abdur Rab Serniabat, sons Sheikh Kamal, Sheikh Jamal, and daughters-in-law Sultana Kamal and Rosy Jamal.\n\nThe president\u2019s Military Secretary Bir Uttam Colonel Jamil Uddin Ahmed, who rushed to the Bangabandhu Bhaban on receiving SOS from him early in the morning, was also slain on way.\n\nHasina and her sister Sheikh Rehana escaped the carnage as they were abroad.\n\nBorn on Mar 17, 1920 at Tungipara, Sheikh Mujib came to limelight with the formation of Purba Pakistan Chhatra League following the end of British rule in the Indian sub-continent.\n\nMujib continued to rise in national politics because of his active involvement in the Language Movement in 1952, 1954 general elections, and six-point declaration in 1966.\n\nHis arrest in the Agaratala conspiracy case catapulted him into national limelight, making him the undisputed leader of the Bengalis' freedom struggle against Pakistani exploitation.\n\nHe was given 'Bangabandhu' title after he was freed from jail in 1969.\n\nOn Mar 7, 1971 he delivered the historical speech at Race Course Maidan (Now Suhrawardy Udyan), which inspired the Bengalis to wage an armed struggle to win independence from Pakistan.\n\nSix of the 12 condemned-to-death killers have so far been hanged in decades of wait for justice. It took 21 years to start the case - only when after the Awami League returned to power in 1996. Five of the convicted killers are reportedly hiding abroad.\n\nThe day was not observed nationally either in these years. The High Court in 2008 declared it National Mourning Day.\n\nThe trial could not be held earlier because the killers were indemnified by Bangladesh\u2019s first military ruler Gen Ziaur Rahman who went on to found the BNP.", "METADATA": {"og": {"url": "https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2020/08/15/bangladesh-is-set-to-mourn-bangabandhu-sheikh-mujib-on-1975-carnage-anniversary", "title": "Bangladesh is set to mourn Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib on 1975 carnage anniversary", "description": "Bangladesh is set to mourn Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of the nation who was assassinated along with most of his family members in one of the worst political massacres in world history 45 years ago.", "image": "https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2020/03/16/sheikh-mujibur-rahman-n-a-mamun-12.jpg/ALTERNATES/w640/sheikh-mujibur-rahman-n-a-mamun-12.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bdnews24com", "creator": "@bdnews24com", "title": "Bangladesh is set to mourn Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib on 1975 carnage anniversary", "description": "Bangladesh is set to mourn Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of the nation who was assassinated along with most of his family members in one of the worst political massacres in world history 45 years ago.", "image": "https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2020/03/16/sheikh-mujibur-rahman-n-a-mamun-12.jpg/ALTERNATES/w640/sheikh-mujibur-rahman-n-a-mamun-12.jpg"}, "description": "Bangladesh is set to mourn Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib on 1975 carnage anniversary", "sectionname": "bangladesh", "articleid": 1790923, "sponsoredArticle": "false", "keywords": "National Mourning Day, Bangabandhu, Sheikh Mujib"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
