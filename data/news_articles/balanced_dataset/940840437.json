He was arrested in London in April 2019 and has been jailed ever since pending the outcome of an eventual trial that will be held to determine if he should be extradited to the U.S. and put on trial.\n\nSchulte, 31, faces charges related to \u201cVault 7,\u201d a massive collection of secret CIA hacking tools that WikiLeaks began releasing in 2017. He has been jailed since later that year.\n\nWikiLeaks said in a news release that Mr. Assange participated for the first time in a short video meeting with his lawyers prior to a pre-trial management hearing Friday.\n\nPublic defenders representing Schulte mentioned their communication problems in a letter filed with his judge in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, meanwhile.\n\nSenior U.S. District Court Judge Paul A. Crotty agreed last month to adjourn Schulte\u2019s case until October 18, while Mr. Assange\u2019s extradition trial is currently set for September.\n\nMr. Assange and Schulte each face counts of violating the U.S. Espionage Act, among other charges, and faces decades behind bars if convicted of all counts.\n\nSchulte was put on trial earlier this year in Manhattan, but his jury deadlocked on most of the charges and the Justice Department subsequently requested a retrial.\n\nMr. Assange launched WikiLeaks in 2006. He is accused of illegally soliciting, receiving and publishing classified U.S. Department of Defense and State documents, including detailed reports about American military activity in Iraq and Afghanistan and thousands of diplomatic cables. Chelsea Manning, a former Army analyst who admittedly leaked that material, consequently served around seven years in military prison and was released early in 2017.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.
