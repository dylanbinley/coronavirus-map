It currently dominates the polls on 55 per cent, with the opposition National Party on 28 per cent.\n\n\"At this stage, it's too early to make any decision but this means there is some flexibility if required,\" said Ms Ardern, who is well ahead in opinion polls and expected to win a second term.\n\nJudith Collins, the leader of the National Party, called for a delay until late November, or even next year.\n\n\"It is simply unsustainable to expect there to be a fair and just election at a time when opposition parties are not free to campaign,\" she said.\n\nPundits believe the calls for putting back polling day are more to do with politics than safety, and that extra time would help the National Party become more competitive.\n\nThe centre-Right opposition party has changed leader twice in the space of eight weeks, and commentators speculate that Ms Collins - nicknamed \"Crusher\" - is playing for time.\n\nAuthorities on Wednesday were still trying to piece together the movements of those infected and the source of the latest infections is still unknown.\n\nBut Ashley Bloomfield, national director-general of health, said tests were being carried out to see if the virus could have been imported via freight, then picked up by a male member of the family, who worked in a cool room for imported goods.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We know the virus can survive within refrigerated environments for quite some time,\" he said, revealing a team was at the Auckland site where the man worked.\n\nIf the theory is proven, it could have profound implications for international trade flows already battered by the months-long pandemic.\n\nChinese officials have reported cases of Covid-19 being detected on the packaging of imported frozen seafood.\n\nOn Tuesday local officials in Yantai, a port city, said it detected the virus on packaging that had arrived from the port city of Dalian, where there had been a recent outbreak.\n\nWhile the four Auckland cases are from the same household, on Wednesday Ms Ardern said four more \u201cprobable\u201d cases had been found, close contacts of the original group who were displaying symptoms.\n\nLate on Wednesday their tests results were not yet known.\n\nOn Tuesday night the lockdown announcement sparked panic buying in Auckland, despite the prime minister stressing to people that there would not be shortages.\n\nToni Helleur, who leads a local community response team, told local media that her group are better prepared this time than they were during the first lockdown.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working really hard to get our systems and processes in a better place, so if there was a second wave we would be able to be a lot more responsive and a lot more ready to provide service and support,\u201d she said.", "METADATA": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooNews", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jacinda Ardern is considering delaying New Zealand\u2019s general election as investigators probe whether a cluster of new cases in Auckland was imported via freight.
