Several people were arrested, an opposition spokesman said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the police.\n\nThere have been sporadic protests in the West African nation since last week when Ouattara went back on an earlier pledge and said he would run in the Oct. 31 election. Critics say this violates the constitution and will destabilise a country still recovering from civil war.\n\nIvory Coast law limits presidential terms to two, but Ouattara says that a new constitution adopted in 2016 acted as a reset button, allowing him to run again.\n\nThe government said on Wednesday it had not authorised the demonstrations planned for the following day and would take action to stop protesters from blocking traffic.\n\nA senior representative of opposition leader Guillaume Soro\u2019s party and four other party members were detained by police on Thursday at a protest in Abidjan\u2019s Cocody district, a party spokesman said on Thursday.\n\nTensions were running high even before Ouattara\u2019s decision to run. The election is seen as the greatest test yet of the tenuous stability achieved since a brief conflict killed about 3,000 people following his first election win in 2010.\n\nOne of Ouattara\u2019s main challengers, former President Henri Konan Bedie, said on Wednesday that two protesters had been killed and others severely wounded during demonstrations held that day outside Abidjan, including in the town of Daoukro and the eastern city of Ferkessedougou.\n\n\u201cA wave of blind repression and brutal attacks is hitting young Ivorian democrats,\u201d Bedie said in a statement.\n\nThe death toll could not be independently verified.
