There\u2019s not anything that could have been done better?\n\nProfessor Murphy was attending the parliamentary hearings on Friday in his new role as the health department secretary after he spent the day in the chair at the royal commission into aged care on Wednesday.\n\nAt those hearings, he was involved in a bizarre incident where he tried to whisper an answer to a colleague while putting his hand over his mouth but his prompting was picked up on the microphone and broadcast across Australia.\n\nRELATED: Follow our live coronavirus coverage\n\nBefore today\u2019s hearing gets underway, I just want to place this extraordinary moment from yday on the timeline.

The lessons of those two outbreaks were not properly conveyed to the sector and as a result the sector was not properly prepared in June 2020 when we witnessed high levels of community transmission of the virus in Melbourne and based on the evidence that you\u2019ve heard, the sector is not properly prepared now.\u201d\n\nSenator Keneally observed there appeared to be lots of talk about learning but some \u201cvery slow learning going on\u201d.\n\n\u201cDo you have an apology for those families,\u201d Senator Keneally asked Prof Murphy.\n\n\u201cI am surprised you haven\u2019t come in here with more humility and sympathy for those 200 families.\u201d\n\nProf Murphy said the Labor Senator was \u201ccompletely incorrect\u201d.\n\nRELATED: Victoria\u2019s lockdown rules explained\n\nRELATED: Expert\u2019s grim Aussie NYE prediction\n\nmedia_camera The Secretary of the Department Dr Brendan Murphy is grilled about the debacle in the age care area in Victoria. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Gary Ramage\n\n\u201cEveryday we look at death statistics and we are deeply shocked and deeply concerned,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTragically, when there is widespread community transmission deaths in aged care will occur.\n\nAsked again if things could have been done better, an exasperated Prof Murphy then sighed and insisted that \u201cof course things could be done better\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve set up the Victorian aged care response centre,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOf course, we learn all the time. This virus is creating rules as it goes. We are not in any way saying we have done everything that could have been done. We have been focused on protecting aged care residents since late January.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Senator Keneally interjected to say that was not evidence to the aged care royal commission as she noted it had heard the aged care sector was still not prepared.\n\n\u201cRespectfully, I would disagree with counsel assisting,\u2019\u2019 Prof Murphy said.\n\nSenator Keneally then interjected again asking, \u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got to say?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can always do more but I reject the assumption that preparation was not very fulsome,\u201d Prof Murphy said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you know what fulsome means,\u2019\u2019 Senator Keneally responded.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean comprehensive. I suggest you look it up.\u201d\n\nProf Murphy then thanked Senator Keneally and said he was happy to take a grammar lesson from her.\n\nLiberal Senator James Patterson then interjected add sarcastically, \u201cYeah, perhaps spend more time with a dictionary that\u2019s a great use of your scarce time.\u201d\n\nOriginally published as Health chief grilled in fiery hearing", "METADATA": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "referrer": "origin", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/adelaidenow/ms-icon-70x70.png", "msapplication-square144x144logo": "https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/adelaidenow/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/adelaidenow/ms-icon-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/adelaidenow/ms-icon-310x310.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/adelaidenow/ms-icon-144x144.png", "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Australias top health bureaucrat Brendan Murphy has clashed with MPs demanding to know who is responsible for over 200 aged care deaths.", "keywords": "aged care, royal commission, care royal commission, community transmission, care deaths, parliamentary hearing, health bureaucrat, aged care sector, chief health, fiery hearing, Health chief, widespread community transmission, aged care deaths, aged care residents, care response centre, aged care response, health department secretary, chief health bureaucrat, community transmission deaths, top health bureaucrat, death rate, chief health officer, Victoria, Australia, Australia and New Zealand, Oceania, Melbourne, Dorothy Henderson Lodge and Newmarch House, James Patterson, Brendan Murphy, Kristina Keneally, James Gourley", "generator": "tcog", "articleid": "8f08d805a2c1ae63955528838d9f06c3", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T02:26:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T02:27:40.000Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@theTiser", "title": "Health chief grilled in fiery hearing", "description": "Australia\u2019s chief health bureaucrat Brendan Murphy has clashed with MPs in a fiery parliamentary hearing over the 200 deaths in aged care as MPs demanded to know \u201cwho is responsible\u201d.", "image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b8d25b66b1a82b60dffd5f4cb904ca17"}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Health chief grilled in fiery hearing", "description": "Australia\u2019s chief health bureaucrat Brendan Murphy has clashed with MPs in a fiery parliamentary hearing over the 200 deaths in aged care as MPs demanded to know \u201cwho is responsible\u201d.", "url": "https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/lifestyle/health/brendan-murphy-grilled-over-aged-care-deaths-in-covid19-parliamentary-hearing/news-story/8f08d805a2c1ae63955528838d9f06c3", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b8d25b66b1a82b60dffd5f4cb904ca17", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "vr": {"canonical": "https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/lifestyle/health/brendan-murphy-grilled-over-aged-care-deaths-in-covid19-parliamentary-hearing/news-story/8f08d805a2c1ae63955528838d9f06c3"}}}}
