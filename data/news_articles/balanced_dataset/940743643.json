The online recruitment is essential to create a database of election workers toward the conduct of the election.\n\n\u201cAlso ongoing is the training of all security personnel to be deployed for the election. INEC has also come up with a code of conduct and rules of engagement for the security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe code of conduct and rules of engagement will be distributed to all the security personnel deployed for the election to guide them properly.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria.\n\nKindly Share This Story:", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=1300", "fb": {"pages": 125111084176530, "app_id": 1281965775160257}, "OBKey": "KoeDKhtk63NPK0HQB1Wydg==", "description": "The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has said it would deploy no fewer than 20,000 ad-hoc staff for Edo State.", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Edo 2020: INEC to deploy 20,000 ad-hoc staff - Vanguard News", "description": "The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has said it would deploy no fewer than 20,000 ad-hoc staff for Edo State.", "url": "https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/08/edo-2020-inec-deploy-20000-ad-hoc-staff/", "site_name": "Vanguard News", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/000_1DW086-e1551302338756.jpg?fit=600%2C368&ssl=1", "width": 600, "height": 368}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/vanguardngr", "published_time": "2020-08-14T10:58:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T10:59:19+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@vanguardngrnews", "site": "@vanguardngrnews"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "google-site-verification": "AjRfeo4BMZn8J99wiq7X1DKIfO_z-Dnma_6csxvuRRg", "alexaVerifyID": "GKUIyYVwwNAjNpxpU_bP3ZbGFeo", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/favicon.png?fit=16%2C16&ssl=1"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
