This limited-run will allow guests in these cities to enjoy MO Bar\u2019s creations without having to even travel out of town.\n\nAlice Cheongdam in Seoul, South Korea.

Every drink has a story to tell, and guests can dive right into an in-depth exploration via a live virtual session with MO Bar\u2019s team. The exchange will also see participating venues take turns to offer their signature cocktails for one week at the bar. This virtual guest shift is definitely the most 2020 way of indulging in top tipples from around Asia, but we\u2019re not complaining.\n\n(Image credit: Mandarin Oriental)\n\nBelow, the current schedule for the pop-ups at MO Bar:\n\n13 to 19 August: Bar Cham, Alice Cheongdam (Seoul, South Korea)\n\n20 to 26 August: Back Room, The Curator, Agimat, Spirits Library (Manila, Philippines)\n\n27 August to 2 September: Irusu Lounge (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam), Galaxy Bar (Dubai, UAE)\n\n3 to 9 September: Room by Le Kief (Taipei, Taiwan), Sidecar (New Delhi, India)\n\nFind out more here.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "In the spirit of adapting to the new normal, MO Bar will do things a bit differently this year with the Volume Two menu.", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "MO Bar brings top cocktails from around Asia to Singapore via a virtual bar tour", "description": "In the spirit of adapting to the new normal, MO Bar will do things a bit differently this year with the Volume Two menu.", "url": "https://www.lifestyleasia.com/sg/food-drink/drinks/mo-bar-singapore-nomadic-forager-virtual-bar-tour-cocktails/", "site_name": "Lifestyle Asia Singapore", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.lifestyleasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/14160947/Harvest-Queen_MO-BAR-2.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 1499}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T08:32:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T09:49:42+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "generator": "AMP for WP 1.0.50", "google-site-verification": "OHZZ9P5I6iNzPlaHOq14BV11or3CVHzuGCYFpsWpc-U", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.lifestyleasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/29153536/cropped-favicon-150x150-1.png"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
