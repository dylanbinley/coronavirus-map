Picture: AntonioGuillem\n\nWARWICK rental prices are set to skyrocket and tenants will soon struggle to even put a roof over their heads, according to predictions from the real estate industry.\n\nA shrinking pool of investment properties, combined with an influx of new residents from Brisbane and other metropolitan areas, indicate the Rose City may soon run out of rentals entirely.\n\nFor First National Real Estate property manager Krista Going, the huge spike in demand for rental homes had seen up to 15 people applying for each Warwick vacancy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a property become available, then literally have applications coming through that night, and we could essentially fill it the next day,\u201d Ms Going said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a mixture of people either moving to town or around town, and a really wide demographic \u2013 anyone from people first moving out of home to those looking to test the area before buying here.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll soon have such a shortage of investment homes that obviously rents are going to go through the roof, if we can\u2019t keep meeting that demand.\u201d\n\nFellow Warwick real estate agent Helen Harm said she had also seen first-hand the wave of new residents seeking a \u201ctree-change\u201d, with the increasing demand to make price hikes inevitable.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s people coming in and snapping up the cheaper homes to flip and sell, or do up and use as a rental, and we\u2019re also selling more to owner-occupiers as well,\u201d Mrs Harm said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re the owner of a property we\u2019re renting at $270 or $280 a week, and you have six or more people wanting it, why wouldn\u2019t you put it up to $300?\n\n\u201cThe market is being pressured from all sides, so if it\u2019s continuing the way it has been since Covid hit, prices are going to go up \u2013 you\u2019re left with no alternative, and the cheaper rentals will be non-existent.\u201d", "METADATA": {"description": "A shrinking pool of rental homes under an increased demand will make price hikes \u2018inevitable\u2019.", "author": "Jessica Paul", "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"app_id": 135411266493476, "pages": 24945426253}, "og": {"site_name": "Warwick Daily News", "title": "THROUGH THE ROOF: Warwick rental prices to skyrocket", "description": "A shrinking pool of rental homes under an increased demand will make price hikes \u2018inevitable\u2019.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2020/08/14/v3imagesbin7633e58da467ce950cbc77704b15c9a3-e1aptnipkzn4iloguu2_ct1880x930.jpg", "width": 1880, "height": 930}, "url": "https://www.warwickdailynews.com.au/news/through-the-roof-warwick-rental-prices-to-skyrocke/4078767/"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047077985, app-argument=warwickdailynews://article?aid=4078767&type=article", "al": {"ios": {"url": "warwickdailynews://article?aid=4078767&type=article", "app_store_id": 1047077985, "app_name": "Warwick Daily News"}, "android": {"url": "warwickdailynews://article?aid=4078767&type=article", "app_name": "Warwick Daily News", "package": "com.apnarm.warwickdailynews"}, "web": {"url": "https://www.warwickdailynews.com.au/news/through-the-roof-warwick-rental-prices-to-skyrocke/4078767/"}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@warwick_daily", "title": "THROUGH THE ROOF: Warwick rental prices to skyrocket", "description": "A shrinking pool of rental homes under an increased demand will make price hikes \u2018inevitable\u2019.", "image": "https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2020/08/14/v3imagesbin7633e58da467ce950cbc77704b15c9a3-e1aptnipkzn4iloguu2_ct300x300.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=1020", "capi-id": "a2c0c9f950f7caf5d02295728566648e", "article": {"content_tier": "locked"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
