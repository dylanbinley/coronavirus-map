This is compared with the 68 per cent - or 265,000 workers - in these sectors who had been given approval to start work last week.\n\nSome 22,500 workers remain in government quarantine facilities and the 17 blocks. \"With more daily movements in and out of the dormitories, it is even more important for everyone to remain vigilant to guard against new infections,\" the joint statement by the four agencies said.\n\nThe measures in place to ensure workers can safely restart work include requiring them to report their temperature and any symptoms of acute respiratory illness through an app twice a day.\n\nWorkers in dormitories and those who work on site in the construction, marine and process sectors will also have to be swab-tested once every 14 days. Employers should space out the testing of their workers so that the authorities are able to \"maintain constant surveillance of the Covid-19 situation\".\n\nWorkers who have recovered from Covid-19 are not required to undergo regular testing for 180 days.\n\nRelated Story Long and hard battle to clear worker dorms of Covid-19\n\nOther measures include staggered pickup and drop-off times for workers to and from their work sites, updating workers' residence addresses and minimising mixing between blocks. Waste water from higher-risk dorms is closely monitored for traces of the virus, and the number of workers who report sick at any medical post is tracked as early indications of possible clusters.\n\nPlans are in place to quickly quarantine and isolate at-risk workers if a potential infection surfaces.\n\nSingapore completed testing of all 323,000 workers in dorms last Friday, with about nine in 10 workers having recovered or been found to be free of the virus as of last week.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "al": {"ios": {"url": "straitstimes://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/fresh-cases-detected-at-dormitories-cleared-of-covid-19", "app_name": "Straits Times", "app_store_id": 547465441}, "web": {"url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/fresh-cases-detected-at-dormitories-cleared-of-covid-19"}}, "description": "There have been new cases detected at dormitories declared to be cleared of the coronavirus, and the authorities are monitoring the situation to manage the risk of new outbreaks..
