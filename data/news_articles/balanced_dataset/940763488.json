He added that there had been no change in his plan to impose Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank in full coordination with the US, but that US President Donald Trump had asked him to wait for a time with its implementation.\n\nHowever, during a press conference yesterday, President Trump seemed to contradict Netanyahu by saying Israel had agreed not to annex parts of the West Bank and that this was \u201cmore than just off the table\u201d. He added that this was a very important and smart concession by Israel.\n\nUAE Crown Prince Bin Zayed tweeted: \u201cDuring a call with President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu, an agreement was reached to stop further Israeli annexation of Palestinian territories. The UAE and Israel also agreed to cooperation and setting a roadmap towards establishing a bilateral relationship.\u201d\n\nPalestinian Authority (PA) Foreign Minister Riyad al-Malki announced that the PA would immediately recall its representatives to the UAE because of the agreement with Israel. The PA called to hold an urgent meeting of the Arab League. PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas also spoke by phone with Hamas Political Bureau Director Ismail Haniyah. Hamas issued a statement saying that the two had agreed to stand as one in their refusal to normalising relations and recognising Israel at the expense of the Palestinian people.\n\nContext: Israel\u2019s links with the UAE are the most extensive within any of the Gulf states.\n\nSince 2010 Israeli-Emirati ties have covertly developed in business and trade, particularly in irrigation technologies, medical supplies and the diamond industry. For Israel, such trade deals are viewed as the vanguard of its \u201csoft-power\u201d diplomacy that promises not just financial return for Israeli businesses, but a wider security dividend too.\n\nIn late June two private Israeli companies signed cooperation agreements with two UAE companies to research and develop technology in the fight against the coronavirus.\n\nIn contrast to other Gulf states, Israeli-UAE ties have also grown due to ideological alignment. Both countries share concerns over the threat of Iranian hegemony and the rise of Islamism in the region, such as the Muslim Brotherhood and its regional offshoots, like Hamas.\n\nThe normalising of ties with the UAE is a major diplomatic achievement for Prime Minister Netanyahu. It strengthens his long-held belief that Israeli-Arab normalisation in the region can happen regardless of peace with the Palestinians.\n\nThe agreement has been welcomed by the majority of Israelis across the political spectrum. Blue and White leader and Defence Minister Benny Gantz said: \u201cThis agreement demonstrates the alliance between countries in the region who are interested in prosperity and regional stability, and it stresses Israel\u2019s eternal ambition for peace with its neighbours\u201d.\n\nYesh Atid leader Yair Lapid called it \u201can important step toward normalisation of relations with the United Arab Emirates. This step is proof that negotiations and agreements, not unilateral steps like annexation, which would harm Israel\u2019s security, are the way forward for our diplomatic relations\u201d. Labor Party leader Amir Peretz said the agreement represents \u201cthe path of political negotiations for a comprehensive peace agreement that will lead to a comprehensive peace accord, which will bring about economic and political prosperity \u2014 and, of course, preserve Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.\u201d\n\nHowever, Netanyahu has come under criticism from many of the settlers and their supporters in the Israeli right-wing for sacrificing annexation for normalisation. In a move likely to capture voters from the extreme parts of the Israeli Right, Yamina leader Bennett said: \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that Netanyahu has squandered the chance to extend sovereignty [to] the Jordan Valley, Malleh Adumim, Beit El and the rest of the settlements.\u201d\n\nThe right-wing Sovereignty Movement of settler activists also condemned Netanyahu for choosing peace with the UAE over annexation of West Bank lands. \u201cThe Prime Minister has turned to the Left \u2013 perhaps due to his legal troubles. Under his leadership the Land of Israel has become a currency for trade,\u201d it said. It further called for him to be pushed out of office and replaced with someone who strongly supports settlements.\n\nLooking ahead: President Trump said that he hopes to have both Netanyahu and UAE Crown Prince Bin Zayed visit the White House in the next three weeks to sign the historic agreement.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "description": "What happened: In a surprise announcement yesterday, Israel and the UAE agreed to a full normalisation of\u00a0relations.
