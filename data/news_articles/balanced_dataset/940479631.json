Its President Milo\u0161 Zeman has been promoting closer ties with China.\n\nPompeo also acknowledged the chairman of the Czech Senate Milan Vystrcil, who followed through on a plan by his deceased predecessor to visit Taiwan at the end of this month, a trip that has angered China.\n\nPompeo said some nations in Europe would take longer to wake up to the threats, but there was a positive momentum.\n\n\u201cThe tide has turned (in the United States), just as I see it turned here in Europe as well. The West is winning, don\u2019t let anyone tell you about the decline of the West,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt will take all of us\u2026 here in Prague, in Poland, in Portugal. We have the obligation to speak clearly and plainly to our people, and without fear. We must confront complex questions\u2026 and we must do so together,\u201d he said.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "wp-parsely_version": "2.1.3", "robots": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot-news": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "googlebot": "max-snippet:160, max-image-preview:large", "description": "China\u2019s global economic power makes the communist country in some ways a more difficult foe to counter than the Soviet Union during the Cold War, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday (12 August).", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Pompeo: Economic clout makes China tougher challenge for US than Soviet Union was", "description": "China\u2019s global economic power makes the communist country in some ways a more difficult foe to counter than the Soviet Union during the Cold War, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday (12 August).", "image": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Pompeo-Czech-Republic-800x450.jpg"}, "og": {"title": "Pompeo: Economic clout makes China tougher challenge for US than Soviet Union was", "url": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/pompeo-economic-clout-makes-china-tougher-challenge-for-us-than-soviet-union-was/", "type": "article", "site_name": "www.euractiv.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Pompeo-Czech-Republic-800x450.jpg", "alt": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/pompeo-economic-clout-makes-china-tougher-challenge-for-us-than-soviet-union-was/"}, "description": "China\u2019s global economic power makes the communist country in some ways a more difficult foe to counter than the Soviet Union during the Cold War, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday (12 August)."}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13 07:31:24", "section": "World", "tag": "Soviet Union"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/ea_favicon_16x16.png"}}}
