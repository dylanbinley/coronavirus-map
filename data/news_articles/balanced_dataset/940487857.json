So it\u2019s a hell of a war,\u201d Mr Storey said.\n\nAdvertising\n\nIn 1943, the Chindits specialist fighting force was formed to push back the Japanese in Burma, who at the time were perceived as \u201cinvincible\u201d, facing disease and monsoon rains in virgin jungle warfare.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got what is agreed to be the worst terrain in the world to fight a military campaign,\u201d Mr Storey said.\n\nThis was followed by the formation of the huge 14th Army led by Lieutenant General William \u201cBill\u201d Slim.\n\n\u201cThis is the most multicultural, multi-faith, multi-national fighting force in the history of modern warfare,\u201d Mr Storey said.\n\nTroops were drawn from across the world, including Britain, India, Africa, China and the US, but their fierce battles did not make equal headlines at home, Mr Storey said.\n\nIndian naval forces in Burma (Crown copyright/PA)\n\n\u201cBut these men fought a hell of a war over a very long period and they didn\u2019t see it in the news.\u201d\n\nVJ Day was jubilantly celebrated at home on August 15 1945, three months after VE Day, but many Far East troops did not return until 1946, carrying back terrible memories, particularly freed prisoners of war.\n\nSome 140,000 Allied military personnel were captured by the Japanese, with, when including civilian internees, around 30,000 dying.\n\n\u201cIt was a different war, they just didn\u2019t feel understood really,\u201d Mr Storey said.\n\n\u201cBut also it had been so hellish, you didn\u2019t want to revel in it all the time. They just put it behind them. They never forgot their comrades.\u201d\n\nMr Storey\u2019s own grandfather, George Storey, who served with the 14th Army, only collected his four medals much later in life.\n\nGeorge Storey (Family handout/PA)\n\nGeneral Lord Dannatt said prisoners of war \u201chad to fight for their own place in national history\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere were numbers who were mentally badly injured, and of course returning prisoners of war were emaciated and starving and had to be rebuilt as people,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said this year\u2019s VJ Day should focus around celebration, commemoration and education.\n\nGeneral Lord Dannatt is backing the RBLI \u201cTommy in the window\u201d campaign, encouraging the public to purchase a specially designed image of a Second World War soldier in their windows to help mark VJ Day.\n\nThe campaign has raised more than \u00a31 million since it was launched for VE Day earlier this year, with figures available via: www.rbli.co.uk/vjday.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter": {"image": "https://guernseypress.com/resizer/mZdH1Rz87Si8rfHwlQrZuvhdjf8=/1200x0/filters:quality(100)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/guernseypress.mna/S2C3OQ3WR5HUPJKBR3KW2RQGVE.jpg", "site": "guernseypress", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Calls to remember \u2018forgotten army\u2019 ahead of VJ Day", "description": "General Lord Richard Dannatt said those fighting in the Far East endured a \u2018brutal\u2019 war, but received little \u2018limelight\u2019."}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Calls to remember \u2018forgotten army\u2019 ahead of VJ Day", "description": "General Lord Richard Dannatt said those fighting in the Far East endured a \u2018brutal\u2019 war, but received little \u2018limelight\u2019.", "image": "https://guernseypress.com/resizer/mZdH1Rz87Si8rfHwlQrZuvhdjf8=/1200x0/filters:quality(100)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/guernseypress.mna/S2C3OQ3WR5HUPJKBR3KW2RQGVE.jpg", "url": "https://www.guernseypress.com/news/uk-news/2020/08/13/calls-to-remember-forgotten-army-ahead-of-vj-day/"}, "description": "General Lord Richard Dannatt said those fighting in the Far East endured a \u2018brutal\u2019 war, but received little \u2018limelight\u2019.", "pb-site": "/news/uk-news", "story": {"": {"premium-flag": "Free"}}, "dfp": {"page-type": "story", "slot": "/news/uk-news", "story": "[\"JJ4AXKI56REL7MAD4WURFKHFMQ\",\"/news/uk-news/2020/08/13/calls-to-remember-forgotten-army-ahead-of-vj-day/\"]", "sites": "[\"/news/uk-news\",\"/news\"]"}}}}
