victims in isolation ahead of gunman\u2019s sentence", "TEXT": "A sentencing date has been set for the Australian terrorist who carried out mosque attacks in Christchurch.\n\nDozens of living victims of mass shooter Brenton Tarrant are in coronavirus isolation in New Zealand ahead of his sentencing.\n\nAustralian man Brenton Tarrant pleaded guilty earlier this year to 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one count of committing a terrorist act after his attacks on two Christchurch mosques in March 2019 which he sickeningly live-streamed on the internet.\n\nIt remains the worst single mass shooting event in the country\u2019s history.\n\nThe 29-year-old\u2019s sentence hearing is scheduled to begin on Monday, August 24 and is expected to take three days.\n\n\u201cBut the hearing will take as long as is necessary,\u201d High Court Justice Cameron Mander said last month.\n\nThe minister in charge of the country\u2019s coronavirus managed isolation and quarantine, Megan Woods, on Thursday said there are 53 people currently isolated so they can attend court in person and 28 are New Zealand citizens or residents.\n\nRELATED: New Zealand records 14 new cases of COVID-19\n\nRELATED: Shooter live-streamed sickening killing spree\n\nMs Woods told Radio NZ 25 people needed an exemption to arrive in New Zealand from the United Kingdom, Turkey, Jordan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Fiji, Egypt, Singapore and Australia.\n\nShe said the list of countries made it \u201cvitally important\u201d that people were placed into managed isolation.\n\n\u201cEvery person who arrives in New Zealand must be isolated from other people in New Zealand for a minimum period of 14 days,\u201d the health ministry states.\n\n\u201cThis measure is key to preventing the transmission of COVID-19 into our communities.\u201d\n\nFinal health checks are carried out before people leave isolation facilities to confirm they have not tested positive for the coronavirus, are not a probable case, have a temperature below 38C and have no symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nRELATED: Brenton Tarrant sacks lawyers ahead of sentence\n\nMs Woods said there are 34 victims among the 53 and the remainder are family members or support people.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that this group is coming in at a particularly traumatic time, so we\u2018re working with police who have liaison members with each of the families,\u201d she told RNZ.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re just incredibly pleased that in the middle of a global pandemic, where it is incredibly difficult to move around the world, that they have been able to travel here to New Zealand to be able to support their family members, many of whom are those who lost immediate family members.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Survivors remember mosque attack one year on\n\nThe Government in July announced it would be extending the border exemption criteria \u201cto enable some offshore victims and support people of the Christchurch mosque attacks\u201d to attend Tarrant\u2019s sentencing.\n\nIt noted limited commercial airline flights and quarantine requirements made it a \u201cchallenge\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe want to support our valued Muslim brothers and sisters who were directly affected by this tragic event and understand that some who are now offshore do want to attend the sentencing,\u201d Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe have quickly established a process to allow victims and a family member or support person to come to New Zealand using new humanitarian grounds. This is within our intent for the use of this provision.\u201d\n\nExpressions of interest were taken for up to two family members of those killed, one family member and one support person, or \u201cthose who were subject to an attempted murder in the attack\u201d and a family member or support person to accompany them.\n\nMr Lees-Galloway said he understood the Ministry of Justice had been working with the court to enable victims who are overseas and unable to travel to view proceedings and read their victim impact statements remotely.\n\nFinancial assistance of up to $5000 for travel, meals and accommodation costs has also been made available to eligible victims by Victim Support.\n\nTarrant, from Grafton in northern New South Wales, fired his legal team earlier this year and intends to represent himself at the hearing.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "tcog", "articleid": "6d0823dbcbae32fdb42618d3b6cba17d", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T02:56:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T03:41:13.000Z", "publisher": "News Limited", "author": "Sarah McPhee", "publicationdate": "13/08/2020"}, "description": "Dozens of living victims of mass shooter Brenton Tarrant are in coronavirus isolation in New Zealand ahead of his sentencing.", "keywords": "family members,attempted murder,Australian terrorist,gunman\u2018s sentence,Australian man,mass shooter,massacre victims,managed isolation,mosque attacks,victim impact statements,sentence hearing,health ministry states,sentence proceedings,quarantine requirements,immediate family members,border exemption criteria,sickening killing spree,global pandemic career,commercial airline flights,coronavirus isolation,isolation facilities,Final health checks,United Kingdom,Northern Europe,Europe,Australia,Australia and New Zealand,Oceania,Borough of Christchurch,Egypt,Northern Africa,Africa,Turkey,Western Asia,Asia,New Zealand,Singapore,South-eastern Asia,Jordan,Fiji,Melanesia,Bangladesh,Southern Asia,Pakistan,Wellington,New South Wales,Getty Images Inc.,Ministry of Justice,Iain Lees-Galloway,Jacinda Ardern,Sarah McPhee,Megan Woods,Brenton Tarrant,Mark Mitchell", "og": {"image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/5c05a419b151a99bbb78b5a7f6280a0d?width=650", "title": "Christchurch victims in 14-day isolation ahead of gunman\u2019s sentencing", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.news.com.au/world/pacific/christchurch-massacre-victims-in-isolation-ahead-of-gunmans-sentence/news-story/6d0823dbcbae32fdb42618d3b6cba17d", "site_name": "NewsComAu", "description": "Dozens of living victims of mass shooter Brenton Tarrant are in coronavirus isolation in New Zealand ahead of his sentencing."}, "fb": {"app_id": 113758722003364, "admins": "1533025129,653135158,737988273"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newscomauHQ", "title": "Christchurch victims in 14-day isolation ahead of gunman\u2019s sentencing"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "news.com.au", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.news.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nca/assets/dist/img/common/favicon/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://www.news.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nca/assets/dist/img/common/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "application-name": "news.com.au", "referrer": "origin", "google-site-verification": "GWTbDFKaKnGKyk3q0Na5jIbWHZ4qXn-ibcfMayjSQA0"}}}
