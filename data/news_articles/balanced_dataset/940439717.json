The rage of the people is understandable,\u201d Maas said.\n\nThe explosion has fueled outrage and protests against top political leaders and led to the resignation of the government Monday. The Cabinet is now in a caretaker capacity.\n\nAhead of his arrival in Beirut, Maas said Lebanon needs a \u201cstrong reboot\u201d and far-reaching economic reforms to rebuild trust with its citizens.\n\nGermany has pledged 20 million euros (about 23 million dollars) in immediate help after the explosion that tore through the Lebanese capital with such intensity that it created a tremor felt in neighboring Cyprus. Thousands of buildings in the heart of the Beirut were destroyed and many more left homeless.\n\nMaas said he would hold talks in Beirut to see how the money can quickly get to the people who need it. He said he would also talk to the nation's political leaders and representatives of civil society about the future of Lebanon.\n\n\u201cI think everyone in Lebanon has to recognize that things cannot continue like this, this country needs big reforms,\u201d he said.\n\nSeparately, France\u2019s president spoke Wednesday to the leaders of Russia and Iran and urged them to cooperate with the rest of the international community to restore stability in Lebanon.\n\nWhile Iran and Russia are important power players in the region and have offered Lebanon aid since last week\u2019s devastating explosion, neither participated in an international donors conference Sunday organized by France and the U.N. to help rebuild Beirut.\n\nSpeaking with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, French President Emmanuel Macron said the region\u2019s major powers should avoid interfering or escalating tensions in Lebanon as it forms a new government, according to Macron\u2019s office.\n\nThe head of the U.N. food agency, David Beasley, announced Wednesday that the organization is bringing 17,500 metric tons of wheat flour and a three-month supply of wheat into Lebanon to help replenish the country\u2019s food reserves. That is part of a rapid logistics operation that will also involve setting up warehouses and mobile grain storage units, according to U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric at Wednesday\u2019s U.N. briefing:.\n\nBeasley said Monday he\u2019s \u201cvery, very concerned\u201d Lebanon could run out of bread in about 2\u00bd weeks because 85% of the country\u2019s grain comes through Beirut\u2019s devastated port. He said, however, that he believed an area of the port can be made operational later this month.\n\nMeanwhile, Lebanon's caretaker Economy Minister Raoul Nehme sought to calm nerves, saying that Lebanon is not facing a bread crisis after the country's only wheat silo was destroyed by the explosion. Speaking during a tour of the port Wednesday, he said Lebanon has enough flour stock sufficient for four months and that part of the port is ready to receive container ships.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writers Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin, Angela Charlton in Paris and Edith M.
