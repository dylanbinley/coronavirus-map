Subsequently, the school\u2019s governing council said it has appointed Mr Soyombo in acting capacity.\n\nIn his reaction, Mr Ogundipe fired back, saying his \u201cpurported removal\u201d was \u201cmischievous disinformation\u201d as \u201cthe extant provisions of the law were not complied with\u201d by the council.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nBy the provision of the UNILAG Act, the president of the country can remove the vice-chancellor \u201cafter due consultation with the Council and the Senate acting through the Minister of Education.\u201d\n\nMr Soyombo\u2019s appointment has been met with stiff opposition within and outside the university environment.\n\nFor instance, the UNILAG chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Universities has rejected his appointment, while also condemning the purported sack of Mr Ogundipe.\n\nDele Ashiru, chair of the university\u2019s local chapter of ASUU, insisted that Mr Ogundipe remained the university\u2019s recognised head, accusing Wale Babalakin, the pro-chancellor, of having vested interest.\n\nHe said: \u201cHis removal is illegal and uncalled for. Our union condemns in the strongest term the purported removal. It is the machination of the pro-chancellor to destabilise this university and our union has been on the forefront of the agitation against a reckless and lawless pro-chancellor,\u201d\n\n\u201cWe reaffirm our confidence in the leadership of Professor Toyin Ogundipe as Vice Chancellor of the university.\u201d\n\nBut in his statement on Friday, Mr Soyombo called for peace among stakeholders in the university.\n\n\u201cI know that opinions are divided on issues at stake and the steps taken so far to resolve the impasse. Our paramount goal should be an amicable resolution of all the issues and to win back the peace and stability of our University,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI therefore urge all parties and members of the university community to come together at this trying period in the interest of our University.\u201d\n\nThe acting vice-chancellor assured that steps will be taken to ensure the security of lives and property on the university campuses, urging students and staff to go about their business and activities by avoiding acts that may disrupt the peace of the university community.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "EuZ43NZRDsrHDz_olgMnglh8OZfGHGtPKcSEDxacgW4", "msvalidate.01": "9064F1B0F33B6263D650A882EE41095D", "yandex-verification": "4d6f2471816e8776", "description": "On Wednesday, the university governing council controversially removed the erstwhile vice-chancellor, Oluwatoyin Ogundipe.", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "UNILAG acting VC speaks on crisis", "description": "On Wednesday, the university governing council controversially removed the erstwhile vice-chancellor, Oluwatoyin Ogundipe.", "url": "https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/408877-just-in-unilag-acting-vc-speaks-on-crisis.html", "site_name": "Premium Times Nigeria", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2017/08/unilag-university-of-lagos-e1503414933755.jpg?fit=700%2C394&ssl=1", "width": 700, "height": 394}}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/premiumtimes", "published_time": "2020-08-14T20:03:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-15T07:00:44+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Ola_deinde", "site": "@premiumtimesng"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2015/01/PT-icon-54b93704v1_site_icon.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1", "fb": {"pages": 248318348539120}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
