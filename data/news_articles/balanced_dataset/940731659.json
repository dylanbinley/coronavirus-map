Nasir Aziz Khan, main spokesman of the United Kashmir People\u2019s National Party (UKPNP), from Gilgit Baltistan, gave this information. A few months ago, the Pakistan government signed an agreement with China, to build the Diamer Bhasha dam on the Indus river. But India raised strong objections on the deal. India issued a stern warning that Gilgit-Baltistan is an integral part of India and such illegal projects will not be tolerated on Indian territory. Ignoring the Indian warning, Pakistan has started illegally handing over natural resources from this region, to China.\n\nUKPNP spokesman Nasir Khan criticised that Pakistan and China are looting the natural resources in the Gilgit-Baltistan region. The Pakistan constitution also is being flouted, along with the international regulations, for this purpose. Khan accused that the Pakistan government has awarded more than 2,000 contracts for Gold, Uranium and Molybdenum excavation to China.\n\nExploiting natural resources from this region is a violation of the Pakistani constitution. As per article 25 of the Pakistan constitution, no one has a right to exploit the natural resources of the Gilgit-Baltistan region. But Pakistan government is flouting the constitution. The rights of the locals are also being trampled. All voices raised against this are being suppressed. UKPNP spokesman pointed out that the Pakistan media also are not willing to take cognisance of the matter.\n\nThe Gilgit-Baltistan region is being looted, bestowing favours on China. Nasir Khan accused that China has acquired these contracts in violation of international regulations. Khan from UKPNP accused that Pakistan has become a puppet in the hands of China and is acting on its instructions. Nasir Khan said that UKPNP would raise this issue in the United Nations\u2019 meeting scheduled to be held in Geneva, in the next month.\n\nPakistan government has imposed a complete ban on media access to the Gilgit-Baltistan, in northern Pakistan. The Pakistan government controls the entire region. A few days ago, the Imran Khan government signed an agreement with China worth 442 billion rupees, to build the Diamer Bhasha dam on the Indus river. 45,000 megawatts power can be generated on the strength of the dam and other natural resources.\n\nAfter cancelling the special status awarded to Kashmir, India has adopted a firm stand that Gilgit-Baltistan is an integral part of India. On the same basis, India has adopted the stand that all the Pakistani and Chinese activities in this region are illegal.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Local leaders accused that the Pakistan government has handed over the Gold and Uranium mines, in the Gilgit Baltistan region, to China.
