Jodine Pilmer and Kandy Cleland host the event where the quirky cast of 21 players, four dogs and one cat will share their isolation survival advice.\n\nThe doors to the Trinity Playhouse in Lisbon have been closed to public performances since mid-March. Since that time, the non-profit Stage Left Players have worked creatively to fulfill their vision to inspire, transform and connect people through community theatre- at a socially safe distance.\n\n\u201cJunior board member Kaleigh Ceci offered to direct, organize and produce this online comedy as a fundraiser for us. Who would say \u2018no\u2019 to that,\u201d Cleland explained. \u201cKaleigh reached out to Stage Left alumni living in NYC and Pittsburgh as well as SLP regulars who embraced the opportunity to collaborate on the project.\u201d\n\nCleland continues to be amazed and grateful for the support of actors and patrons who remain determined to keep Stage Left going.\n\n\u201cThe doors are closed, but the bills still need to be paid. Online or on stage we can still make people smile,\u201d she said.\n\nTickets to the online comedy may be purchased by going to StageLeftPlayers.org. Every online ticket purchase will help the Trinity Playhouse meet operating expenses while doors are closed to the public due to the Covid 19 pandemic.\n\n\u201c10 Ways to Survive Life in a Quarantine\u201d by Don Zolidis is presented in agreement with Playscripts Inc. as prepared for Richard Ceci.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Sebring BOE to meet   SEBRING- The Sebring Local School District Board of Education will hold its August regular board meeting at 6 p.m. Monday via Zoom at\u00a0htt", "keywords": "Neighborhood News,ACROSS\u2008OUR\u2008COMMUNITIES", "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "fb": {"app_id": "A8-yQ0N91Ala-xG3JIwTiyp8UTBCAw39C1PowzV.voLCWuJTxZncaDBi"}, "og": {"locale": {"identifier": "en_US", "alternate": "en_US"}, "image": "http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.salemnews.net/images/2016/10/13131603/fblike.jpg"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
