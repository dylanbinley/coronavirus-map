Nasser Nasser AP Photo\n\nAfter 13 days of interrogation, Israel finally allowed Mahmoud Nawajaa to see his lawyer on Wednesday.\n\nThis is the first time Nawajaa, the general coordinator of the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement for Palestinian rights, has been allowed to see a lawyer since Israeli occupation forces seized him from his home near Ramallah in a night raid on 30 July.\n\nHe has not been allowed to see his family.\n\nNawajaa told the lawyer from the prisoners rights group Addameer that he \u201chas been subjected to ill-treatment and degrading detention conditions but not torture.\u201d\n\nThis has been a major concern as Israel\u2019s Shin Bet secret police, which is behind his detention and interrogation, systematically uses torture against Palestinians.\n\nOn Sunday, an Israeli military court prolonged Nawajaa\u2019s detention for a further eight days \u2013 the second such extension since his arrest.\n\nDemanding EU action\n\nOn Tuesday, dozens of people rallied outside Germany\u2019s diplomatic office in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah.\n\n\u201cWe are rallying here to demand that the EU end its complicity of silence and apply concrete pressure on Israel to release Mahmoud Nawajaa and respect the rights of Palestinian human rights defenders,\u201d Majida Masri, coordinator of the Palestinian Women\u2019s Campaign for Boycotting Israeli Products, said.\n\nWatch | Palestinians hold a protest outside the representative office of Germany in Ramallah, the occupied West Bank, in support of #BDS coordinator Mahmoud

\u2013 despite the EU\u2019s close alliance with Israel and general reluctance to criticize its abuses.\n\n\u201cIn view of the current situation, the office of the EU Representative in Jerusalem is closely following the case,\u201d European Union foreign affairs spokesperson Peter Stano told The Electronic Intifada on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe EU has repeatedly called upon the Israeli authorities to respect the human rights of prisoners including their right to a fair trial and access to legal counsel,\u201d Stano added.\n\nHe said the bloc \u201cstrongly advocates for minimizing the usage of administrative detention and ensuring that it is carried out in accordance with international human rights standards.\u201d\n\n100+ Palestinians protested yesterday at Germany\u2019s Ramallah delegation office against Israel\u2019s detention of BDS coordinator Mahmoud Nawajaa.\n\n\n\nThey urged Germany, holder of EU\u2019s rotating presidency, to \u201cforce [Israel] to uphold human

by Israel of holding Palestinians for indefinite periods without charge or trial to punish them for political activities.\n\n\u201cThe EU also uses informal contacts to voice concerns regarding such cases, in particular those of extensive and disproportionate use of administrative detention,\u201d Stano said.\n\nUnlike Amnesty International, which has declared Nawajaa a prisoner of conscience, the EU has stopped short of demanding his immediate release.\n\nFreedom of expression\n\nThe European Union opposes the BDS movement, which seeks to put pressure on Israel similar to the international boycott campaigns that helped end South Africa\u2019s white supremacist apartheid regime.\n\nBut the EU has affirmed that such campaigning is protected political speech.\n\nThat position was confirmed in a landmark ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in June, overturning the criminal convictions of a dozen activists in France for calling on supermarket shoppers not to buy Israeli products.\n\n\u201cThe EU stands firm in supporting freedom of expression and freedom of association, including the space for civil society organizations,\u201d EU spokesperson Stano told The Electronic Intifada.\n\n\u201cMeasures touching upon the role and functioning of civil society organizations should not have the effect of imposing arbitrary or disproportionate restrictions on the enjoyment of their rights, in line with international human rights standards,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile Nawajaa remains under interrogation, boycott campaigner Majida Masri said \u201cthe initial indicators reveal that Shin Bet has no case.\u201d\n\nIsrael has for years waged a global smear and sabotage campaign against the nonviolent BDS movement, including falsely trying to associate activists with what it calls \u201cterrorism.\u201d\n\nThrough Addameer\u2019s lawyer, Nawajaa said he is \u201cin good health and spirits and determined to continue his BDS work for Palestinian rights.\u201d\n\nHe also expressed \u201cdeep gratitude\u201d for solidarity efforts around the world.\n\nUpdate: 13 August\n\nOn Thursday, Israel extended Mahmoud Nawajaa\u2019s detention for a third time, adding at least another five days to his imprisonment without charge or trial.\n\n\u201cWe need to intensify our campaign to #FreeMahmoud,\u201d the boycott movement\u2019s Majida Masri said.\n\n\u201cIsrael is fabricating false allegations against him as retribution for the BDS movement\u2019s impressive growth and impact in the last few years.\u201d\n\n15 days. Israel has been detaining Palestinian human rights defender and BDS coordinator Mahmoud Nawajaa since July 30. It just extended his detention by 5 days.\n\n\n\n15 days of silence from the EU.@JosepBorrellF: The EU must pressure Israel to #FreeMahmoud! https://t.co/cpDdUpAV01 pic.twitter.com/m4dsV7hjA5 \u2014 BDS movement (@BDSmovement) August 13, 2020\n\nPlease contact Minister Simon Coveney on behalf of our colleague, @BDSmovement General Coordinator and human rights defender Mahmoud Nawajaa.
