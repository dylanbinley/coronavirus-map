It was leaving San Diego.\n\nExpeditionary Sea Base USS Hershel \u201cWoody\u201d Williams (ESB-4) pulled into Naples, Italy today for a stop on its first deployment.\n\nWoody Williams left Naval Station Norfolk late last month for its first deployment, which is slated for a focus on operations in U.S. Africa Command, USNI News recently reported.\n\n\u201cIn this complex maritime environment, a ship like this enables options to project power with a persistent presence,\u201d Vice Adm. Gene Black, U.S. 6th Fleet commander, said in a statement. \u201cThe ship is ideal for missions in this theater as it can readily integrate with the Marines and our allies and partners in many of our operations throughout the region at varying levels of complexity.\u201d\n\nThe crew includes both civilian mariners and sailors aboard the ship and is the second in the Lewis B. Puller-class of expeditionary sea base vessels.\n\nBefore leaving Norfolk last month, Woody Williams Blue Crew Commanding Officer Capt. David Gray said the crew was prepared to participate in a wide range of missions, including non-combatant evacuations and anti-piracy operations.\n\nThe ship has the capacity for four helicopters on its flight deck, can launch unmanned assets, and includes command and control systems.\n\nWhile the Navy has a more limited presence in AFRICOM compared to the other combatant commands, Gray said ahead of the deployment that Woody Williams\u2019 presence in the region can help other naval assets like amphibious ships or destroyers focus on higher-end operations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already got a great mission set setup, where we\u2019re going, what we\u2019re going to do and who we\u2019re going to work with. And I tell you, it\u2019s going to be very exciting,\u201d Gray said at the time.\n\nThe Navy in March commissioned Woody Williams in Norfolk after disclosing plans earlier this year to commission all ESB vessels as warships, instead of Military Sealift Command ships eligible for brief warship designations.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Expeditionary Sea Base USS\u00a0Hershel 'Woody' Williams\u00a0Makes Port Stop in Naples - USNI News", "description": "This post has been updated to correct an incorrect photo caption indicating USS Hershel \u2018Woody\u2019 Williams (ESB-4) was arriving in Naples, Italy.
