By SIA KAMBOU (AFP)\n\nGbagbo's party, the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI), has yet to name a candidate. Gbagbo was cleared of crimes against humanity last year by the International Criminal Court, although prosecutors are appealing the ruling.\n\nFormer rebel chief and ex-premier Guillaume Soro, 47, has said he will contest the vote, but he lives in self-imposed exile in France.\n\nSoro has been sentenced in absentia to a 20-year jail term in Ivory Coast on charges of attempted insurrection.", "METADATA": {"title": "Four dead in Ivory Coast clashes over Ouattara election bid", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1", "description": "At least four people have been killed in clashes in Ivory Coast as hundreds have taken to the streets following President Alassane Ouattara's decision to run for a third term this October, sources said on Thursday.", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@modernghanaweb", "title": "Four dead in Ivory Coast clashes over Ouattara election bid", "description": "At least four people have been killed in clashes in Ivory Coast as hundreds have taken to the streets following President Alassane Ouattara's decision to run for a third term this October, sources said on Thursday.", "creator": "@modernghanaweb", "image": {"src": "https://cdn.modernghana.com/images/content/afp_demonstrators_set_fire_to_barricades_to_try_to_block_streets.jpg"}, "domain": "www.modernghana.com"}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Modern Ghana", "title": "Four dead in Ivory Coast clashes over Ouattara election bid", "url": "https://www.modernghana.com/news/1022882/four-dead-in-ivory-coast-clashes-over-ouattara.html", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.modernghana.com/images/content/afp_demonstrators_set_fire_to_barricades_to_try_to_block_streets.jpg", "alt": "Demonstrators set fire to barricades to try to block streets.
