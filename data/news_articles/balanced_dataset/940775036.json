Sign up to the Life newsletter for daily tips, advice, how-tos and escapism. The list of countries Brits can travel to is shrinking, as six more destinations have been removed from the government-approved travel corridors list. As of this weekend, France, the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks & Caicos, and Aruba will no longer be considered travel corridors. This means \u201call but essential\u201d travel will be restricted to these destinations and any Brits currently holidaying must quarantine for 14 days upon their return. Luxembourg, Andorra, The Bahamas and Belgium were also added to the UK\u2019s 14-day quarantine list last week, while Spain was added last month. If you were planning to book a holiday in the near future, the latest news might leave you wondering if it\u2019s worth it. We\u2019ve weighed up some of the pros and cons, so you can make the right choice for you.\n\n\u00a9 DisobeyArt via Getty Images\n\nYou could get a cheap holiday The biggest perk of booking at the moment has to be the cost of travel. The turbulent situation means you may be able to snap up a bargain if you decide to risk it, says Emma Coulthurst, travel commentator from holiday price comparison site TravelSupermarket. \u201cOn the back of this announcement, we expect to see a further shift in destination demand to Turkey, Greece and Italy,\u201d she tells HuffPost UK. \u201cThe pay off of lowering consumer demand is great value holiday prices.\u201d Package holiday prices to Turkey and Greece have fallen around 28% due to consumer uncertainty following the changes in Spain, Coulthurst says. Meanwhile package holidays to parts of Italy are down by as much as 50%. \u201cResorts close to Dalaman, Antalya, Bodrum and to Crete, Corfu, Rhodes and Rome are the most searched for in the last few days,\u201d she says. \u201cTurkey is also popular due to the plummeting lira and how far your money stretches there at the moment.\u201d\n\nAssume you\u2019ll need to quarantine upon your return Bear in mind the travel corridors list is regularly changing \u2013 often at short notice \u2013 so even if you choose a destination currently exempt from restrictions, that might change while you\u2019re abroad. Even if you simply transit through a country that\u2019s not exempt, you\u2019ll still be required to self-isolate for 14 days. You\u2019ll need to specify the location you\u2019ll be self-isolating in on a \u2018public health passenger locator form\u2019 before travelling. The rules dictate that you travel to that location (usually your home address) directly from your UK arrival. You\u2019ll have to organise food and other deliveries to your accommodation. A key consideration before booking a holiday is how easy it\u2019ll be to quarantine upon your return. If you\u2019re still working from home, for example, it might not pose much of an issue. If not, Coulthurst recommends chatting the decision through with your boss, first. A government spokesperson confirmed to HuffPost UK that you\u2019ll still need to quarantine for a full 14 days after travel, even if you take a coronavirus test that comes back negative. This is because the virus may be in your system, but not detectable yet. It\u2019s not just UK quarantines you need to consider If there are suspected cases of coronavirus where you are, you may need to remain in your hotel room or accommodation for 14 days or move to quarantine facilities. Beware this is a possibility if you\u2019re prone to cabin fever and can\u2019t stand the thought of being so close, yet so far, from the beach. Doubly important to consider if you\u2019re a parent: will you be able to cope with little ones in one room for 14 days?\n\n\u00a9 Deagreez via Getty Images\n\nYou could be left out of pocket Following the latest announcement, \u201cthousands of holidaymakers are likely to be left significantly out of pocket because their airline will refuse to refund them,\u201d according to Rory Boland, travel editor at consumer watchdog Which?. \u201cUnlike tour operators, airlines now routinely ignore Foreign and Commonwealth Office travel warnings and refuse refunds because, they argue, the flight is still operating,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe government wants us to act responsibly and not travel to countries with an FCO warning, but it needs to make it clear to airlines that they, too, need to act responsibly and not ignore government travel advice in an effort to pocket customer cash.\u201d Some airlines and train companies are allowing passengers to change their departure date for free. However, in many cases the no-fee policy can only be used up to a certain date before departure, explains Coulthurst. Many providers require you to pay change fees closer to the date of departure. Eurostar requires changes without fees up to a fortnight before, as do easyJet. \u201cIt\u2019s one week before with Ryanair,\u201d adds Coulthurst. \u201cPassengers may be under the false belief that no change fees apply at any time up to the departure date.\u201d Flights are relatively cheap at the moment, so Coulthurst says some passengers may have bagged a \u00a350 return flight, only to now be facing a \u00a390 charge to change the date. \u201cIt makes it pointless to change and so people are likely to have to give up and lose money,\u201d she says. \u201cSome airlines are proactively communicating their no fee change flexible policy, but not being as proactive about communicating the parameters of it, which gives people false hope that they can change it.\u201d If you do decide to book... Coulthurst recommends following these steps to limit the risks of travel chaos: Look at coronavirus rates for the country which you are thinking of visiting \u2013 Worldometer is a good site for this.\n\nCheck and double check the entry requirements of the country which you are looking to travel to. Don\u2019t rely on the government exemption lists.\n\nBook a package. Yes, some providers have been struggling to pay back refunds in time, but things are getting better. With a package, you know that you can cancel if FCO advice changes to essential travel only.\n\nBook on a credit card for extra Consumer Credit Act protection.\n\nTake your free EHIC card to Europe (make sure it is up to date) \u2013 you can use it up to 31 Dec.\n\nGet good travel insurance in place.\n\nBe aware of the Ts and Cs of the company you are signing up to.\n\nGallery: 50 habits that are keeping you from saving (Espresso)", "METADATA": {"application-name": "Is It Even Worth Booking A Holiday Abroad Right Now?", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "Travel", "robots": "noindex, nofollow", "description": "We\u2019re here to guide you through the coronavirus pandemic.
