In times of crisis, vacations for governors and MPs are prohibited,\u201d said the head of the Greek Solution.\n\nMeanwhile, Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias was in Israel on Thursday to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyaju and his Israeli counterpart Gabi Ashkenazi, as reported by Greek City Times.\n\nDuring the separate meetings, Dendias said he \u201chad the opportunity to thank the Israeli side for its clear position on the issue of Turkey\u2019s violations of international legality in the Eastern Mediterranean.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made clear to my Israeli interlocutors that Turkey\u2019s violations of international legality constitute a risk for all countries in the region and jeopardise security and stability,\u201d he added.\n\nApart from the Turkish violations in the eastern Mediterranean, the FM also had the opportunity to talk about energy security issues and the EastMed pipeline. The 1,900-kilometre EastMed pipeline, which has been in planning for several years, is intended to provide an alternative gas source for energy-hungry Europe, which is largely dependent on supplies from Russia and the Caucasus region.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover", "description": "The Party leader of the Greek Solution political party has said that Greek women need weapons training and that illegal immigrants need to be transferred to", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Greek Party Leader: Women Need Weapons Training Too - Greek City Times", "description": "The Party leader of the Greek Solution political party has said that Greek women need weapons training and that illegal immigrants need to be transferred to", "url": "https://greekcitytimes.com/2020/08/15/women-need-weapons-training-too/", "site_name": "Greek City Times", "image": {"identifier": "https://greekcitytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-35.jpg", "secure_url": "https://greekcitytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-35.jpg", "width": 963, "height": 541, "alt": "Greek Party leader: Women need weapons training too", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/greekcitytimes/", "tag": "Velopoulos", "section": "Greek NEWS"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Greek Party Leader: Women Need Weapons Training Too - Greek City Times", "description": "The Party leader of the Greek Solution political party has said that Greek women need weapons training and that illegal immigrants need to be transferred to", "site": "@greekcitytimes", "creator": "@greekcitytimes", "image": "https://greekcitytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-35.jpg"}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://greekcitytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/favicon-96x96.png"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
