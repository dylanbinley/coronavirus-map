(THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh)\n\n\u2018I Don\u2019t Remember:\u2019 Man Accused of Killing Alberta Doctor Makes Court Appearance\n\nRED DEER, Alta.\u2014A man accused of killing a family doctor at a walk-in clinic in central Alberta appeared confused at his first court appearance Wednesday, telling a judge that he doesn\u2019t remember and is sick.\n\nDeng Mabiour of Red Deer, Alta., is charged with first-degree murder in Monday\u2019s death of 45-year-old Dr. Walter Reynolds, as well as other offences.\n\nThe 54-year-old appeared via a video link but wasn\u2019t able to tell the judge if he understood the charges laid against him.\n\n\u201cListen to me. I don\u2019t remember anything because I\u2019m sick. I want a doctor,\u201d Mabiour, with a heavy accent, told provincial court Judge Bert Skinner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you I didn\u2019t remember anything because I am sick.\u201d\n\nSkinner ordered the duty counsel to speak with Mabiour by phone. The charges were then read a second time.\n\n\u201cDid you understand the charges?\u201d asked the judge.\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t understand,\u201d Mabiour replied. \u201cBecause I am sick. I lost memory. Listen to me, I don\u2019t remember. I want a doctor.\u201d\n\nMabiour continued talking as the judge and lawyers spoke.\n\nSkinner said a first-degree murder charge that goes to trial is automatically put before a jury.\n\nThe case was put over to Sept. 9.\n\nRCMP have said the attack was not random and the two men knew each other through the clinic. They have not said if Mabiour was a patient, citing confidentiality.\n\nOfficers received a 911 call reporting an assault in progress at the Village Mall Walk-in Clinic just after 11 a.m. Monday. Mounties arrived within minutes.\n\nOne witness told media that she heard cries for help and a man in the clinic had a hammer and a machete.\n\nMabiour was arrested at the scene. Reynolds was rushed to hospital, where he died.\n\n\u201cIn 27 years of policing, I\u2019ve never seen a doctor attacked like that,\u201d RCMP Supt. Gerald Grobmeier said at a news conference Tuesday.\n\nDr. Peter Bouch works at a different Red Deer clinic but said that both he and Reynolds had moved to Canada from South Africa. He said the death is a shock to many in the medical community.\n\nA vigil for Reynolds has been planned for Friday night at city hall.\n\nBy Bill Graveland", "METADATA": {"msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/assets/themes/eet/images/EET270.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": 1615635982023706, "admins": 10205921529470972, "app_id": 1316421701839253}, "date": "2020-08-12 4:09:42 PM", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "description": "A man accused of killing a family doctor at a walk-in clinic in central Alberta appeared confused at his first court appearance Wednesday, telling a judge that he doesn't remember and is sick.", "keywords": "Alberta Doctor,Canada,clinic,Court appearance,walk-in clinic,THE EPOCH TIMES", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'I Don't Remember:' Man Accused of Killing Alberta Doctor Makes Court Appearance", "description": "A man accused of killing a family doctor at a walk-in clinic in central Alberta appeared confused at his first court appearance Wednesday, telling a judge that he doesn't remember and is sick.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/i-dont-remember-man-accused-of-killing-alberta-doctor-makes-court-appearance_3459574.html", "site_name": "www.theepochtimes.com", "updated_time": "2020-08-12T17:48:03-04:00", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2020/08/12/CP18575760-1200x675.jpg"}, "article": {"tag": "Alberta Doctor,Court appearance,Canada,walk-in clinic,clinic", "section": "Canada", "published_time": "2020-08-12T16:09:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-12T17:48:03-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A man accused of killing a family doctor at a walk-in clinic in central Alberta appeared confused at his first court appearance Wednesday, telling a judge that he doesn't remember and is sick.", "title": "'I Don't Remember:' Man Accused of Killing Alberta Doctor Makes Court Appearance", "site": "@EpochTimes", "domain": "www.theepochtimes.com", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2020/08/12/CP18575760.jpg", "creator": "@EpochTimes"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"package": "com.theepochtimes.news", "url": "eetapp://applinks/i-dont-remember-man-accused-of-killing-alberta-doctor-makes-court-appearance_3459574.html", "app_name": "The Epoch Times: Live & Breaking"}, "ios": {"app_store_id": 670443321, "app_name": "The Epoch Times: Live & Breakings", "url": "eetapp://applinks/i-dont-remember-man-accused-of-killing-alberta-doctor-makes-court-appearance_3459574.html"}}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
