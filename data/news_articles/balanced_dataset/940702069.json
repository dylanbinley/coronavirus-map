Moments later, the shares resumed their climb in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cPeople with very little money just want to express their anger and express their support for our company,\u201d Lai said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday. \u201cEverybody bought a little bit. That became a lot of it and jacked up the price. I was telling people \u2018don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it, because you\u2019re going to lose money.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe warning from Lai, who was released on bail Wednesday after becoming the most prominent pro-democracy activist to be arrested under Hong Kong\u2019s new national security law, fell on deaf ears. Next Digital shares climbed as much as 42% Friday morning, resuming the roller-coaster ride the holding company\u2019s been on this week. Lai denies he broke the law.\n\nThe shares are still up almost 400% for the week and last traded at 44 H.K. cents, although that\u2019s far below their intraday high of HK$1.96.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission has requested brokers to submit client information and recent transaction records related to Next Digital\u2019s shares, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported, citing unidentified brokers. On Tuesday, the regulator warned investors to exercise \u201cextreme caution\u201d with the stock and that it would closely monitor trading activity in Next Digital.\n\nIn response to the report, Lai said he doesn\u2019t know what the SFC might be trying to do but said the people who recently bought the shares were just expressing support for the company, which owns Apple Daily. The paper\u2019s offices were searched this week by police.\n\nSeparately, Lai ruled out taking advantage of Next Digital\u2019s share surge by issuing new stock at inflated prices, saying that would be a \u201cvery dishonest way\u201d for the company to raise money. Lai also said he has no plans to divest his shares in his media empire, whose business \u201cwill go on without me\u201d should he be convicted.\n\n\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "METADATA": {"google-site-verification": "zWd3GBob8xHwHzdHykjyZghrk4nEAPISbQKZaSyEpcs", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable = no", "og": {"url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/jimmy-lai-says-don-t-buy-his-stock-investors-buy-it-anyway-1.1479878", "site_name": "BNN", "title": "Jimmy Lai Says Don\u2019t Buy His Stock.
