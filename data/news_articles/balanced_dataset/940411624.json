As per US intelligence, China had a much better understanding of Indian troop positions and movements ahead of the 15 June Galwan clash in Ladakh. The assumption is that Pakistan had shared its intelligence on Indian Army with China, thereby making a considerable value addition to Chinese operations.While intelligence cooperation between the two is not unknown, in the past Islamabad was a little more cautious, providing intel in return for some specific favour.

The role of Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa is central to this, with his extension hailed by Beijing. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said: \u201cGen Bajwa is an extraordinary leader of the Pakistani army. He is also an old friend of Chinese government and the army.\u201dChina is usually careful of commenting on such internal appointments in another country, which makes this lavish praise noteworthy. Moreover, Beijing was earlier distinctly unhappy with Pakistan\u2019s handling of sensitive issues, including\n\nfrequent attacks\n\non its nationals by Baloch separatists in the Chinese-operated port of Gwadar, the ingress of religious preachers into Xinjiang, and other such issues. In fact, in a first, China even \u2018named and shamed\u2019 Pakistan at the\n\nNational People\u2019s Congress\n\n, with official media also proclaiming the threat of radical Islam from Pakistan. In 2017, it went so far as to close its borders.\n\n\n\nAll that seems to be in the past now, as Islamabad pulls up intel cooperation with Beijing by its bootstraps.\n\n\n\nWe are deeply grateful to our readers & viewers for their time, trust and subscriptions.\n\n\n\nQuality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it.

China is now going a step further in pushing Pakistan to allow the designation of the BLA as a terrorist entity at the UN. This is embarrassing for Islamabad, which doesn\u2019t want the situation to be \u2018internationalised\u2019 at a time when it is liquidating Baloch\u2019s youth by the dozens.\n\nEvidence of intelligence sharingWhen Baloch insurgents attacked the Chinese consulate in Karachi, the perpetrators were killed in just a month in Kandahar. Whoever launched the strike had precise intelligence, since almost an entire rung of leadership of the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) was wiped out. When the same group tried to attack the Karachi Stock Exchange \u2013 where China has a 40 per cent stake \u2013 all four members were killed, with the whole operation wound up in \u201ceight minutes\u201d by the Sindh Rangers. Clearly, security forces were literally waiting for the insurgents to show up, indicating advance intelligence of no small degree.Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) seems to have thrown all its resources into protecting Chinese interests, with sources indicating that Chinese ambassador himself has sometimes sat in on high-level meetings of security agencies on the issue.
