underscores the difficult balancing act facing the government under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as it seeks to wean Canadians off of COVID-19 supports, while also ensuring that unemployed or partially employed workers continue to receive adequate coverage.\n\nThe CERB program has been criticized for being overly generous at $2,000 per month, creating a disincentive for some recipients to return to work.\n\nA survey last month by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which represents 110,000 small and medium-sized businesses, found that 27 per cent of business owners had encountered workers who \u201crefused to return to work when recalled.\u201d Of those who refused to return, 62 per cent cited a preference to stay on the CERB program, according to the July 16 survey.\n\nIt\u2019s robust, it\u2019s ready to ingest the millions of Canadians it needs to\n\nA total of 8.5 million Canadians have been approved for the CERB benefit as of August 2, for a total cost of $64 billion, according to government data.\n\nQualtrough also spoke to the House of Commons Finance Committee on Wednesday about the WE Charity controversy, in which she distanced herself from the initial decision to seek out a third party to administer a student support program.\n\nThe minister said she did not know why a scheduled discussion about the Canada student service grant (CSSG) program was pulled from the agenda ahead of a May 5 cabinet meeting, which has since become a central focus in the controversy.\n\n\u201cI was not involved in any discussions about why this was pulled from the agenda, [nor] the prime minister\u2019s request for due diligence, as this wasn\u2019t my file,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she was aware that the prime minister and his wife, Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, had taken on speaking engagements with the WE organization, but had no further knowledge about any connections between the Liberal members and the charity.\n\nQualtrough also repeated her defence as to why the Liberal government used a third party to administer the $900-million CSSG program, saying the public service at the time was too preoccupied with major COVID-19 programs like CERB.\n\n\u201cThere was massive public service bandwidth issues, we were asking them to do so very much at that time,\u201d she said.", "METADATA": {"viewport":
