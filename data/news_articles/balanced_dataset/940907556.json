The Palestinian Authority has castigated the new accord as \u201cdespicable\u201d and a \u201cbetrayal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not talking about a very slow and gradual process \u2026 There are sectors that we would like to develop with Israel, and there are sectors that Israel would like to develop [with us],\u201d UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said during an interview with the Walla news site, billed as the first by an Emirati minister with an Israeli news site.\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nThe interview was also published in English on Axios.\n\n\u201cI see teams meeting in order to address many of the areas of interest in Israel and in the UAE,\u201d Gargash continued, adding that the countries\u2019 respective negotiation teams would meet \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\n\nEXCLUSIVE: I interviewed today the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the UAE @AnwarGargash. This was the 1st ever interview of an Emirati official with an Israeli reporter. We spoke about normalization and annexation. All the details soon on @axios.

He declined to specify when he expected to see Israeli tourists in the UAE and vice versa, but stressed that he hoped the cultural exchanges would begin taking place \u201csoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope soon, I really hope soon. This is not something we are talking about being gradual, we need to get things moving, we need to start, so I hope soon and Israel is going to be part of Expo Dubai, so clearly this is important that we also see Israeli visitors coming to Dubai,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is an important milestone in Arab-Israeli relations. We have seen many milestones which were less successful. If we learn something from the region, it is that it is not once you announce something that it becomes instantly successful. We all have to work together,\u201d the UAE minister said.\n\nGargash stressed that a primary achievement in the deal for the UAE was the suspension of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s plans to annex large parts of the West Bank for a \u201clong time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand Israeli politics. It is very complicated. But this is a three-way commitment. We are sure that as we will keep our commitment, and the US is involved, [and] Israel will keep its commitment. I think we have bought a lot of time\u2026 I don\u2019t think it is a short suspension,\u201d he added.\n\nNetanyahu, seeking to appease the right wing and settlers, said Thursday that President Donald Trump asked him for a \u201ctemporary halt\u201d to the move as part of the deal with the UAE, but that he remains committed to \u201capplying sovereignty in Judea and Samara\u201d in coordination with the US.\n\nGargash expressed hope that the long-term suspension would provide a window of opportunity for Israelis and Palestinians to return to the table in order to negotiate toward a two-state solution.\n\n\u201cWe keep urging Palestinians and Israelis to come back to the negotiations table. You can\u2019t stop the time bomb but at the same time not do anything in terms of the interaction that is needed,\u201d he said.\n\nFor their part, the various Palestinian factions in the West Bank and Gaza have roundly lambasted the normalization announcement as a stab in the back on the part of a supposed Arab ally.\n\nEarlier Friday, the UAE assistant minister for culture and public diplomacy, rejected the charge, insisting the agreement had made progress in the absence of any other workable proposal from the Arab world.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve demonstrated that we are able to enter a very staid and tired situation and to shake things up, and we look forward to seeing positive developments coming out of this real engagement,\u201d Omar Saif Ghobash told AFP in an interview.\n\nHend al-Otaiba, the director of strategic communications at the UAE\u2019s Foreign Ministry, told The Times of Israel Thursday that Abu Dhabi remains committed to the establishment of a Palestinian state and to the terms of the Arab Peace Initiative.\n\nFirst adopted by the Arab League in 2002, the Arab Peace Initiative calls for full diplomatic ties between Israel and the entire Arab and Muslim world in exchange for a \u201cfull Israeli withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied since June 1967,\u201d the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and a \u201cjust\u201d and \u201cagreed upon\u201d solution to the Palestinian refugee question.\n\nAsked for clarification of the UAE\u2019s position on the Arab Peace Initiative, a spokesperson subsequently replied: \u201cA two-state solution is at the heart of the Arab Peace Initiative. In the absence of a freeze on annexation, a two-state solution will quickly cease to be a possibility.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the UAE, Israel and the US issued a joint statement announcing an agreement on \u201cthe full normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.\u201d The Emirates presented the move, which was bitterly rejected by the Palestinian Authority, as an achievement for West Bank Palestinians, in that it halts Israel\u2019s plans to annex parts of the territory.\n\nHistoric day.\n\nThe three-way call resulted in an agreement to stop Israeli annexation of Palestinian lands. UAE has worked strenuously over the past months for this diplomatic achievement, which will bring stability to the region and support the peace process. \u2014 \u0647\u0646\u062f \u0645\u0627\u0646\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062a\u064a\u0628\u0629 Hend Al Otaiba (@hend_mana) August 13, 2020\n\nThe UAE\u2019s de facto ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, issued a statement that led with the sides reaching an agreement \u201cto stop further Israeli annexation of Palestinian territories,\u201d and only then added that the sides \u201calso agreed to cooperation and setting a roadmap towards establishing a bilateral relationship.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=1024", "description": "Day after historic deal, Foreign Minister Gargash tells Israeli site his country wants to push forward on normalization with Israel 'as soon as possible'", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/images/toi_icon_144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 123142304440875}, "og": {"url": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/uae-minister-vows-to-push-forward-with-normalization-deal-as-soon-as-possible/", "type": "article", "title": "UAE minister: We bought lot of time on annexation; Palestinians should negotiate", "description": "Day after historic deal, Foreign Minister Gargash tells Israeli site his country wants to push forward on normalization with Israel 'as soon as possible'", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2020/06/AP_18169367329603-1024x640.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 640}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "timesofisrael", "title": "UAE minister: We bought lot of time on annexation; Palestinians should negotiate", "description": "Day after historic deal, Foreign Minister Gargash tells Israeli site his country wants to push forward on normalization with Israel 'as soon as possible'", "image": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2020/06/AP_18169367329603-1024x640.jpg"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
