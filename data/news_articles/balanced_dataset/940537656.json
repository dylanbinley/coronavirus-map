[nL8N2FD5YQ]\n\nRokia Diarra, a resident of the neighbourhood, told Reuters that clashes started around 0600 GMT after the police arrived and fired several rounds of tear gas.\n\n\u201cThere was panic. The demonstrators scrambled for safety. Some were trampled,\u201d Diarra said.\n\nPhotos on social media showed the square hazy with gas. A spokesman for the government was not available for comment.\n\nThe protests led by an opposition coalition called M5-RFP have gained momentum in the West African country since June following a contested legislative election in March. Protesters also accuse the government of corruption and incompetence.\n\nThe demonstrations have sometimes led to violence. Human Rights Watch said in a report on Wednesday that Mali\u2019s security forces have used excessive force against protesters.\n\nHRW said at least 14 people were killed and over 300 wounded, including demonstrators, bystanders, and security force members during three days of unrest in July.
