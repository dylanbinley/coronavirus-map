That's what I shared with foreign minister Lavrov,\" Pompeo said in the interview, conducted during his official visit to the Czech Republic.\n\n\"I know our military has talked to their senior leaders as well. We won't brook that, we won't tolerate,\" Pompeo said.\n\nLast month, U.S. and European sources familiar with intelligence reporting said that the United States had acquired fresh reporting backing up the allegations that Russia had encouraged Taliban-affiliated militants to kill U.S. and allied soldiers in Afghanistan.\n\nThe intelligence reporting comes as the United States has been engaged in negotiating with the Taliban as well as the Afghan government to get a stalled peace agreement, struck in February for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, moving.\n\n(Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Reuters Ltd.
