The bloc will start drawing up a list of officials linked to President Alexander Lukashenko who could be sanctioned.\n\nWhile criticizing the use of violence during post-election protests in Poland\u2019s eastern neighbor, Pompeo dodged the question on potential sanctions on Belarus or a need to repeat the ballot.\n\n\u201cWe spent these last days on talks with our partners to understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d Pompeo told the briefing after meeting Polish counterpart Jacek Czaputowicz. \u201cThe common objective is to try to help as best we can the Belarusian people achieve sovereignty and freedom.\u201d\n\nPoland believes that a new, fair ballot should be held in Belarus, but key issues of who should organize the vote and how to manage the situation in the interim need to be decided, Czaputowicz told reporters.\n\nWarsaw was the last stop on Pompeo\u2019s Central European tour. The U.S. Secretary of State visited the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Austria and Poland to discuss security, including in 5G network development, but the trip agenda has been dominated by a growing unrest in Belarus.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Pompeo signed an expanded defense cooperation agreement with Poland that will result in 1,000 additional U.S. personnel sent to the eastern European country in rotations.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "METADATA": {"civicscience": {"jspoll-hostname": "www138.civicscience.com"}, "application-name": "U.S. Says Belarus Vote Not Free, Takes No Stance on Sanctions", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "International Relations", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "The presidential election in Belarus wasn\u2019t free and fair, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in Warsaw on Saturday, without clarifying the U.S. stance on potential sanctions on Minsk.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}}}
