This information was only divulged literally days before parents have to fill out the form and make a decision.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the board extended the deadline to midnight on August 16 for parents to decide whether their children will go back to classes at school or study full-time online at home.\n\nMark Fisher, a trustee at the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board, said he was \u201ctaken aback and extremely surprised\u201d when the high school schedule was released Tuesday night. He thought the hybrid model meant high school students would be in school buildings half the time. \u201cWow, this is nothing like what we\u2019ve been discussing as a board,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s not a school reopening plan, said Fisher. \u201cIt\u2019s an online learning plan.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "vf": {"container_id": "998141e8-5de0-444b-9b51-c46152164d61"}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Ottawa Citizen", "title": "Parents, students upset about high school back-to-school plan that calls for mainly online learning", "image": {"identifier": "https://smartcdn.prod.postmedia.digital/ottawacitizen/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/health-coronavirus-usa-15.jpg", "width": 750, "height": 1000}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheOttawaCitizen/"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ottawacitizen", "title": "Parents, students upset about high school back-to-school plan that calls for mainly online learning", "image": "https://smartcdn.prod.postmedia.digital/ottawacitizen/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/health-coronavirus-usa-15.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/parents-students-upset-about-high-school-back-to-school-plan-that-calls-for-mainly-online-learning?ia_markup=1"}, "fb": {"pages": 6533373917}}}}
