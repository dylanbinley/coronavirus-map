To start with, IFPL look at the fund house pedigree. Whether the fund house is acting in investor interest or not? Is it complying with all regulations? In last 4 years IFPL did not worked with 2 or else 3 fund houses purposely looking into their portfolio style and it pays a lot to us. The ownership of the fund house also matters. It should have a stable management. When it comes to choosing funds, IFPL look at the risk-adjusted performance in equity funds. Beta is also an important parameter. IFPL look at consistent performance.\n\nStrong Base\n\nAt IFPL (IMPERIAL FINSOL PVT.LTD.) strongly believe that the process is more important than having any star fund manager. If he quits then its seen in the industry that funds gets badly impacted, so is the fund house capable of managing the funds well? To address this aspect they need to make sure that the fund house has a good processed driven and fundamentally strong team, recently one of the big fund house has 2 big names exited, however the performance of the funds has not impacted however it has been outperformed the peers, this has because of a defined fund management process, supported by experienced analysts and senior fund managers.\n\nRisk management is top Priority\n\nMost mutual fund houses have a dedicated risk management team that operates independently of the fund management team. This team is responsible for putting in place a proper risk management framework and ensure the fund management team operates within these boundaries. Such processes have become extremely important in the light of recent downgrade/credit episodes. Recently in few credit events of few fund houses have done extremely well and few were the laggard so this is one of the most important criteria when they choose the fund for yourself.\n\nSafety First\n\nThe credit events in the fixed income space has brought forth the importance of liquidity risk and credit risk in debt funds, which have been pushed debt funds as an alternative to FD\u2019s.\n\nSeveral investors are now trying to invest in mostly safe categories of funds like liquid, overnight and arbitrage. They are of the view that they might take risk with equity funds and use debt funds to protect capital. Retail investors looks for debt funds for margin of safety. Retail investors still didn\u2019t digest that even in debt fund can give negative returns and Franklin event has shaken up entire industry that scheme can get closed as well and fund will get lock in as well for some time unless resolution is not getting in place. Debt funds that have a conservative approach towards managing their debt portfolios and have a predictable style and clear thought process. Some other factors are fund size, vintage, percentage of allocation in securities, segment which are liquid & attentiveness risks within funds\u2019 portfolio (to instruments and issuers), expense trends, etc.\u201d\n\nValues & Principles by Ethics\n\nHonesty is most difficult aspect to find in world.\n\nBesides fund performance and processes, Investors are becoming increasingly conscious of avoiding AMCs that are too focused on increasing their bottom-line at the cost of investors. fund house delicacies its investors. Is it reducing the total expense ratio (TER) where performance is hard to come by? Some fund houses ask investors to lower their return expectations. As few Amc\u2019s are listed now so they have margin pressure on them to increase their profits than the returns of the investors, but they don\u2019t reduce TER if the performance is slipping. Please escape such AMCs.\n\nMost Important Agenda is Portfolio\n\nPast performance of an equity fund does not guarantee of future returns. Track the portfolio of the funds very consistently and they have in house system of cross verifying the funds and funds portfolio with communication of fund manager and in their view most of the fund those who get high rating, won\u2019t sustain long run with that rating, instead IFPL analyses the current portfolio of funds and the thought process of a fund manager. \u201cSince IFPL have experience in analyzing companies and managing Broking business too and equity portfolios, IFPL look at the current portfolio of any fund. This gives an idea of how a fund is positioned to benefit in the future. Past performance does not matter to us because it cannot be repeated in the future, and strongly recommend that do not come in trap of rating of the fund as they may not even know how they got this rating.\n\nWho Runs Fast, Elephant or Horse?\n\nFund leaders frequently say that fund size is not a chief factor of presentation; however their finding is opposite to this thought. Especially when the scheme size becomes large, IFPL avoid funds which are too large in size. For instance, in Multi cap they invest only in the funds which are anything in between 1000 to 3500 cr., in small and mid-cap, IFPL avoid funds with AUM of more than 2000 crore. In mid-caps, the upper threshold is Rs 2,000 crore and in large caps they avoid schemes having AUM of more than Rs 5,000 crore. IFPL have done an internal study of fund returns over 20 years which shows that smaller sized funds have delivered better than large-sized funds, even where the fund manager is same. IFPL don\u2019t exit funds that go beyond this AUM upper limit; IFPL don\u2019t add more allocation to such funds. Thus, the fund size has to be not too small and too large either.\u201d\n\nIs that fund getting regular inflow of Money?\n\nIt goes without saying that a good fund will attract inflows while a bad fund will see investors exiting. So, funds that get consistent inflows indicate that investors have conviction on the fund manager philosophy and framework.\n\n\u201cThe fund should be getting regular inflows even if the inflows are small. This helps the fund manager look for new opportunities as well as the buying good quality stocks at lower levels by which he can add more value to the Funds. When fund see the outflow it dent the overall performance of the fund and manager has to sell good liquid stocks at cheap price and give money back to investors.\n\nNew fund suggestions remain reasonable\n\nAfterward SEBI\u2019s recategorization standards, there has been a considerable reduction in new fund offers. But are all new fund launches bad? \u201cIFPL don\u2019t mind recommending NFO if the concept is novel, unique and valuer proposition is good looking into the market scenario. The portfolio is good and if it comes from a fund house with is known for its performance then it makes investors more comfortable.\n\nIs fund manager most Important?\n\nMostly before to meet with fund manager, ask him about the fund style, Proposition, sectors which he is bullish for 3 year down and how dynamically he will be managing the fund. Whether it is concentrated approach or more diversified across sectors and most importantly what are overall earnings of the portfolio with conservative or aggressive approach. Try to know the past track record along with his character and thought process. IFPL believe that manager should be dependable and trustworthy even nevertheless he may not be the most popular fund manager.\n\nWhen to say good bye to fund?\n\nNo fund can live up to its hopes forever. While short term deficit can be ignored, steady loss for a continued period is a clear red flag. If the fund is not undertaking thriving, it is advisable to monitor the performance for a year time and if doesn\u2019t recover, IFPL believe it is superlative to departure or halt allocating fresh money to such funds.\n\nJust before wrap up, picking the correct fund for their client is an art & science both. Investors must concentrate on both quantifiable and qualitative reasons while zeroing in on the ideal outlines for self.\n\nHappy Investing!!!\n\nIMPERIAL FINSOL\n\nContact Us : 8446686863, 9595889988\n\nEmail Us : wecare@imperialfin.com\n\nFollow Us : https://www.facebook.com/imperialfinsol\n\nFollow US: https://www.linkedin.com/company/imperialfinsol/\n\nSubscribe YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/IMPERIALMONEY\n\nVisit Us : www.imperialfin.com\n\n\n\nAbout Imperial Finsol Pvt.Ltd.\n\nImperial Finsol Pvt.Ltd., a Firm committed for providing a personalized solution for Wealth Management needs.
