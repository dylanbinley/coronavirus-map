German settlers had already been claiming land and cattle as their own, and using Namibians as slave labourers.\n\nNamibia was a German colony between 1884 and 1915, after which it was controlled by South Africa, before becoming independent in 1990.\n\nGerman and Namibian officials have participated in eight rounds of talks on this issue since 2015. One major point in dispute is the terminology used to refer to the payments. Namibia said it is \u201cinadequate\u201d that Germany would not call it \u201creparations\u201d, saying that the German government wants to call it \u201chealing the wounds\u201d money instead.\n\nPresident Hage Geingob said he is still satisfied with the progress of negotiations and hopes a final agreement can be reached soon.\n\nNamibian Mike Uta (34) told The Irish Times his great-grandparents survived the genocide by fleeing to Botswana, where they lived as refugees. He said Hereros and Namas are still displaced and impoverished. Their land, which was one of the richest parts of Namibia in terms of natural resources, was taken from them, and they have since been greatly underrepresented in government, meaning they have little power. More than 100 years later, \u201cthey are still just trying to find themselves, re-establish\u201d, he said.\n\nMr Uta said if an agreement is reached, Hereros don\u2019t want Germany to put the money in the hands of Namibia\u2019s government, \u201cbecause they won\u2019t distribute it fairly\u201d.\n\nThere have been other incidents of European colonial powers paying compensation for historic abuses in Africa.\n\nColonial forces\n\nIn 2013, then British foreign secretary William Hague announced the United Kingdom would pay almost \u00a320 million pounds (\u20ac22 million) to 5,228 Kenyans who were tortured by British colonial forces during the Mau Mau uprising in the 1950s, as well as contributing towards the construction of a memorial in Nairobi. Despite this, the UK refused to accept legal liability.\n\nThousands of people were killed during the Mau Mau uprising. A further legal challenge by lawyers representing 40,000 more Kenyans failed, while other legal challenges, about the treatment of Kenya\u2019s Kipsigis and Talai peoples by the British, are ongoing.\n\nIn June, after Belgium\u2019s King Philippe apologised to the Democratic Republic of the Congo for \u201cacts of violence and cruelty\u201d carried out while it was a Belgian colony, activists also called for reparations.", "METADATA": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "description": "Officials from both sides have participated in eight rounds of talks on this issue since 2015", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom14328604"}, "news_keywords": "News, World, Africa, Hage Geingob, Mike Uta, Philippe King, William Hague, Mau Mau, Belgium, Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Germany, Gulu, Kenya, Nairobi, Namibia, South Africa, Uganda, United Kingdom", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "all", "og": {"title": "Namibia rejects \u20ac10m from Germany as apology for genocide", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/africa/namibia-rejects-10m-from-germany-as-apology-for-genocide-1.4328604", "site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "Officials from both sides have participated in eight rounds of talks on this issue since 2015", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4328603&origw=1440", "secure_url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4328603&origw=1440", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IrishTimesWorld", "creator": "@sallyhayd", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/africa/namibia-rejects-10m-from-germany-as-apology-for-genocide-1.4328604", "title": "Namibia rejects \u20ac10m from Germany as apology for genocide", "description": "Officials from both sides have participated in eight rounds of talks on this issue since 2015", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4328603.1597251240!/image/image.jpg", "account_id": 15084853}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "fb": {"pages": 45441411157, "app_id": 1170474839675514}}}}
