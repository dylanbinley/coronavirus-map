A protracted guerrilla war, characterized by roadside bombs and sniper attacks, eventually forced Israel to withdraw in May 2000. With the exception of an inconclusive, monthlong war in 2006, the volatile frontier has largely remained calm.\n\nThe U.S. and Israel, along with Britain, Germany, the Arab League and Gulf Arab states have also designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. The European Union has only designated the group\u2019s military wing as terrorist, in the aftermath of an attack on a tourist bus in Bulgaria in 2012.", "METADATA": {"description": "Lithuania on Thursday designated the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group as a terrorist organization and issued a 10-year ban on all individuals related to the Iran-backed group from entering the Baltic nation\u2019s territory.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index,follow", "author": "WRAL", "section": "News", "sub-section": "Political News", "og": {"title": "Lithuania designates Hezbollah as a terrorist organization :: WRAL.com", "description": "Lithuania on Thursday designated the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group as a terrorist organization and issued a 10-year ban on all individuals related to the Iran-backed group from entering the Baltic nation\u2019s territory.", "image": "https://wwwcache.wral.com/presentation/v3/images/content/social/open_graph/wralnews_1920x1080.jpg", "url": "https://www.wral.com/lithuania-designates-hezbollah-as-a-terrorist-organization/19233592/", "site_name": "WRAL.com", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T10:10:46-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300, "pages": 14827657177}, "twitter": {"site": "@wral", "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.wral.com/lithuania-designates-hezbollah-as-a-terrorist-organization/19233592/", "title": "Lithuania designates Hezbollah as a terrorist organization", "description": "Lithuania on Thursday designated the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group as a terrorist organization and issued a 10-year ban on all individuals related to the Iran-backed group from entering the Baltic nation\u2019s territory.", "image": "https://wwwcache.wral.com/presentation/v3/images/content/social/open_graph/wralnews_1920x1080.jpg"}, "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=19233592|asset_type=story"}, "pinterest": "nohover", "dcterms.created": "2020-08-13 10:10:46", "dcterms.modified": "2020-08-13 10:10:59", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://wwwcache.wral.com/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://wwwcache.wral.com/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://wwwcache.wral.com/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://wwwcache.wral.com/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://wwwcache.wral.com/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1"}}}
