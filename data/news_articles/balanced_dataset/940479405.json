The group that was defeated by Damascus and its allies three years later, has been found in receipt of US support across many reports and by many regional officials.\n\nAssad said Washington lent force to \u201cthe Caesar Act, (because) it wanted to express its support to the terrorists,\u201d referring to the most recent bout of the US sanctions on Syria.\n\nThe much-condemned Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act came into effect on June 17, six months after it was signed into law by US President Donald Trump, targeting individuals and businesses anywhere in the world that operate either directly or indirectly within the sphere of Syria's economy.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the bans \u201cthe beginning of what will be a sustained campaign of economic and political pressure to deny\" the Syrian government \"revenue.\u201d\n\nThe measures are meant to prevent the government \"from securing a military victory,\u201d US Ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft said that month amid Syria\u2019s ongoing battle against foreign-backed militancy and terrorism.\n\nAssad, however, asserted that the war will not prevent the country from assuming its duties, and attributed all of the country\u2019s gains against the foreign-backed mercenaries so far to supporting the country's army, SANA reported.\n\nWashington\u2019s blockade, he advised, was to be confronted through boosting domestic production and self-reliance.\n\n\u2018Israel strikes sought to help Daesh\u2019\n\nThe president went on to point to an instance of Israeli support for Takfiri terrorists inside the country by citing a round of Israeli strikes against Syrian military positions in the eastern province of Dayr al-Zawr and the southwestern province of al-Suwayda on June 23. The Syrian Defense Ministry confirmed at the time that two Syrian army soldiers had lost their lives and four others sustained injuries during the strikes.\n\n\u201cThe Israeli aggression on Dayr al-Zawr came to facilitate the movement of Daesh terrorists,\u201d Assad said, according to the news agency.\n\nTel Aviv repeatedly targets the Syrian army and its allies\u2019 strongholds in what Damascus condemns as an attempt at slowing the Arab country\u2019s counter-terrorism advances.\n\nThe Israeli regime had previously been found supporting the Takfiris on numerous occasions too as seen in its providing medical treatment and safe havens for them outside the Syrian territory.\n\n\u2018Liberating Golan, terror fight no different\u2019\n\nThe Syrian president, meanwhile, asserted that Syria\u2019s Golan Heights, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967, \u201cremains in the heart of every honest Syrian.\u201d\n\nThe US recognized Israel\u2019s \u201cright\u201d over the territory in 2019, but Assad asserted that no \u201cimmoral\u201d Israeli or American decision could change the territory\u2019s status among Syrians.\n\n\u201cOur right to regain it is inseparable from our right to liberate all our lands from terrorism,\u201d he said.\n\nStill addressing the country\u2019s aggressors, Assad said \u201cthere is no difference between a local or imported terrorist, a Zionist soldier, Turkish or American one, all of them are enemies on our territory.\u201d\n\nThe US and its allies invaded Syria after Daesh\u2019s emergence under the pretext of uprooting the outfit. The coalition retains its presence in the Arab country, three years after Daesh\u2019s defeat.\n\nSince 2016, the Syrian territory has also been subject to repeated Turkish incursions. Late that year, Turkey began joining Iran and Russia in de-escalation efforts in Syria, but the Turkish forces assigned to the Arab country have repeatedly violated their mandates, engaging with the Syrian military. Ankara has also been found liable for funding several anti-Damascus terrorist groups.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1,,minimum-scale=1", "description": "TEHRAN (Tasnim) \u2013 Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said the US needs terrorists on the ground in the region, and levied its recent draconian sanctions against Syria as a means of throwing support behind them.", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "US Needs Daesh, Other Terrorists in Region: Assad - World news - Tasnim News Agency", "description": "TEHRAN (Tasnim) \u2013 Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said the US needs terrorists on the ground in the region, and levied its recent draconian sanctions against Syria as a means of throwing support behind them.", "site_name": "Tasnim News Agency", "article": {"author": "Tasnim News Agency"}, "url": "/en/news/2020/08/13/2326666/us-needs-daesh-other-terrorists-in-region-assad", "image": "https://newsmedia.tasnimnews.com/Tasnim/Uploaded/Image/1396/05/16/1396051603055990111585404.jpg"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
