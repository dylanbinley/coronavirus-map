You must understand that you are being used, and our children are being used, like cannon fodder,\" Lukashenko said in televised remarks.\n\n\"Today people have come from Poland, the Netherlands, Ukraine and from Russia. Aggression against our country has already begun,\" he said, suggesting anti-Kremlin activists were trying to whip up trouble.\n\nHe had earlier joked that he was alive and had not fled abroad.\n\nTikhanovskaya on Friday asked supporters to sign an online petition demanding a recount, believing she was cheated out of victory.\n\nShe called for an end to violence, which has surged since Lukashenko's re-election, and asked all city mayors to organize peaceful gatherings this weekend.\n\nAt least two protesters have died and about 6,700 were detained this week in the crackdown.\n\nThe government on Friday began releasing thousands of detained protesters after issuing a rare public apology in an effort to quell the nationwide protests.\n\nA man in Minsk on Friday shows marks on his body he says were left by a police beating, after being released from a detention centre where protesters were detained.

An EU diplomat said the gathering decided to instruct their foreign policy unit to prepare a list of individuals to be blacklisted, marking a first step toward new sanctions.\n\n\"What happened in Belarus in the last few days is completely unacceptable and calls for a clear reaction of the EU,\" Germany's Haiko Maas told reporters.\n\n\"We aim to put certain persons who are known and took part in crimes against peaceful protesters under the EU sanctions regime.\"\n\nA sketch depicting Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is pictured during a march in solidarity in Warsaw on Friday.

While Austria, Sweden and Germany lead the hawkish camp, Poland, the Czech Republic, Denmark and the Baltic states have also called for mediation between Lukashenko and the opposition.\n\nHungary is the leading skeptic on sanctions, which require unanimity of all the EU countries for agreement.\n\nNot the 1st EU censure\n\nThe EU first imposed sanctions on Belarus in 2004. It tightened them in 2011 over abuses of human rights and democratic standards, including vote rigging.\n\nMany were lifted after Lukashenko released political prisoners in 2016. But an arms embargo remains, as do sanctions on four people over the unresolved disappearances of two opposition activists, a journalist and a businessman years ago.\n\nMaas called on the Belarus government to release political prisoners and review the official election result.\n\nEmployees of Minsk Tractor Works gather outside a plant during a meeting in Minsk on Friday to protest against the presidential election results. (Vasil Fedosenko/Reuters)\n\nPolish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz said EU officials would now work on an exact blacklist of Belarusian individuals involved in the voting process and responsible for the violence.\n\n\"We ... need to find a careful balance between pressure against and engagement with Belarus President Lukashenko. We believe the EU should assume the role of a mediator as soon as possible,\" he also said in a joint letter with five other peers, which was seen by Reuters ahead of talks among the 27.\n\nWarsaw is wary of any repeat of the 2013-14 street protests in Kyiv, which the EU and the United States supported and Russia then used as an excuse to annex Crimea from Ukraine before backing separatists in the east of the country.\n\nWorkers from state-run firms join protests\n\nIn her video, Tikhanovskaya said: \"We need to stop the violence on the streets of Belarusian cities.

She has fled to Lithuania since the controversial result. (Vasily Fedosenko/Reuters)\n\nProtesters said the fact that Lukashenko had been officially credited with 80 per cent of votes in the election showed it had been massively rigged, as Tikhanovskaya drew large crowds in the weeks before the vote.\n\nLukashenko, 65, has also faced increasing anger over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 which he dismissed as a \"psychosis\" \u2014 as well as a sluggish economy and human rights.\n\nProtesters for the second straight day were joined by workers from some state-run industries that are the pride of Lukashenko's Soviet-style economic model.
