His first wife Richa was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1987 and died in 1996.\n\nIn 2018 a film about his life, \"Sanju\", was released covering the period from just before Dutt's Bollywood debut with romantic drama \"Rocky\" in 1981 to his release from jail in 2016.\n\nHis new film \"Sadak 2\" (\"Road 2\") is due to release on Disney+ Hotstar later this month.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt, whose life has been so colorful and tragic that it became the subject of a biopic, has been diagnosed with lung cancer, Indian media reports said Wednesday.", "author": "The Jakarta Post", "srv": "www-02", "fb": {"pages": 102060486500863, "app_id": 1555622744692546}, "keywords": "Sanjay-Dutt,cancer,bollywood", "cdb": {"id": "6657ac82168da9fa101c8a4066db2554"}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "The Jakarta Post", "title": "Troubled Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt 'diagnosed with cancer'", "image": "https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/08/13/2020_08_13_102248_1597285342._large.jpg", "description": "Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt, whose life has been so colorful and tragic that it became the subject of a biopic, has been diagnosed with lung cancer, Indian media reports said Wednesday.", "url": "https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2020/08/13/troubled-bollywood-star-sanjay-dutt-diagnosed-with-cancer.html"}, "twitter": {"site": "@jakpost", "creator": "@jakpost", "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2020/08/13/troubled-bollywood-star-sanjay-dutt-diagnosed-with-cancer.html", "title": "Troubled Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt 'diagnosed with cancer'", "description": "Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt, whose life has been so colorful and tragic that it became the subject of a biopic, has been diagnosed with lung cancer, Indian media reports said Wednesday.", "image": "https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/08/13/2020_08_13_102248_1597285342._large.jpg"}, "tjp": {"thumbnail": "https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/08/13/2020_08_13_102248_1597285342._small.jpg"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
