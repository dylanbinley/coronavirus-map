It was the latest flare-up of a long-running dispute over construction of a military airport on land claimed by the commune about 25 miles south of Hanoi.\n\n\n\nOfficial reports said that villagers had assaulted police with grenades and petrol bombs, but a report drawn from witness accounts and released by journalists and activists seven days later said that police had attacked first during the deadly clash that also claimed the lives of three police officers.\n\n\n\nPolice blocked off pathways and alleys during the attack and beat villagers \u201cindiscriminately, including women and old people,\u201d the report said, calling the assault \u201cpossibly the bloodiest land dispute in Vietnam in the last ten years.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile all land in Vietnam is ultimately held by the state, land confiscations have become a flashpoint as residents accuse the government of pushing small landholders aside in favor of lucrative real estate projects, and of paying too little in compensation to those whose land is taken.\n\n\n\nReported by RFA\u2019s Vietnamese Service.
