It was for the love of the cr\u00eape \u2013 whether sweet or savory \u2013 that drove the two to research this popular street food and pair them with flavors found around the world. In 2012 they opened their first Sweet Paris in the popular Rice Village shopping district. While their hearts carried them on this culinary journey, the two possess serious business acumen.\n\nAllison was born and raised in Houston. After graduating from St. John's School, she attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. It's there she met Chavez who was from Guadalajara, Mexico. After the two graduated from that prestigious business school, Allison worked as an investment banking financial analyst at Credit Suisse in New York City. Ivan has been in the hospitality industry, specifically development and operations of beach resorts in Mexico, since 2007.\n\nLOCATIONS\n\n\n\nSweet Paris, Rice Village Sweet Paris, CityCentre Sweet Paris, Nuevo Vallarta 2420 Rice Blvd. 797 Sorella Ct.
