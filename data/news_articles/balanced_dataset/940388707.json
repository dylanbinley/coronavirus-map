Also, we will make sure that women are carried along in planet change issues and also in areas where women are predominantly involved, like in agricultural activities.\u201d\n\nNoting that 70 per cent of agricultural activities in Nigeria involves women, he added that some of the priority areas in the gender action plan are agriculture, forestry, health, water and sanitation, energy, transportation.\n\n\u201cThrough these sectors, we can reduce the emissions in Nigeria, thereby meeting our indices as we committed ourselves during the Paris Agreement,\u201d he said.\n\nCommitment to reducing emissions\n\nThe minister also announced that Nigeria\u2019s commitment to reducing emissions by 20 per cent this year, in lieu of the Paris Agreement, has been achieved.\n\nAlso, in the same agreement, Nigeria has committed itself to 45 per cent reduction of emissions by the Year 2030.\n\n\u201cBut this time around, Nigeria will need the assistance of international organisations or the international community in general to be able to achieve this commitment,\u201d Mr Mahmood said.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "EuZ43NZRDsrHDz_olgMnglh8OZfGHGtPKcSEDxacgW4", "msvalidate.01": "9064F1B0F33B6263D650A882EE41095D", "yandex-verification": "4d6f2471816e8776", "description": "The Nigerian government is developing a \"National Gender Action Plan and Planet Change,\" Minister of Environment says.", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Nigeria developing plan to address effects of climate change - Minister", "description": "The Nigerian government is developing a \"National Gender Action Plan and Planet Change,\" Minister of Environment says.", "url": "https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/408530-nigeria-developing-plan-to-address-effects-of-climate-change-minister.html", "site_name": "Premium Times Nigeria", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/08/Eave9pKXkAA0pgl.jpg?fit=2232%2C1488&ssl=1", "width": 2232, "height": 1488}}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/premiumtimes", "published_time": "2020-08-12T18:38:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-12T19:50:30+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@premiumtimesng", "site": "@premiumtimesng"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2015/01/PT-icon-54b93704v1_site_icon.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1", "fb": {"pages": 248318348539120}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
