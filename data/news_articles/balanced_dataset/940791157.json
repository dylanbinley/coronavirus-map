It is abundantly clear that Emmerson Mnangagwa's corrupt regime has since consigned the principles of separation of powers of the three arms of government into dustbins.\n\n\"What we now have is a domineering Executive that is giving political orders to Judiciary thereby upsetting the l balance. The influence of the Executive on the Judiciary effectively puts our justice delivery system into a pit latrine. This is a d chapter in the history of the try! Despite the persecutions by the prosecution, we shall not relent in our fight against corruption.\" said Chuma\n\nThe ruling by Justice Wamambo comes at a time several political activists opposed to Government are standing trial for various charges and have been denied bail by the courts.\n\nJournalist Hopewell Chin'ono and convener of July 31 protests Jacob Ngarivhume are being charged with incitement to commit public violence or alternatively incitement to participate in a gathering with the intent to promote public violence by posting messages through social media.
