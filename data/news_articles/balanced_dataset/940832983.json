Eastman, who\u2019s frequently the only constitutional lawyer on any panel or symposium who believes that birthright citizenship isn\u2019t guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, used his reasoning to argue that Harris is not a natural\u2010\u200bborn citizen and therefore ineligible to be Vice President because she is ineligible to be President. This is because, according to Eastman\u2019s theory, Harris\u2019 parents were non\u2010\u200bcitizens when she was born on U.S. soil and not subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. government. Funny enough, Eastman believes that Ted Cruz is a natural\u2010\u200bborn citizen while Harris is not, but this is actually perfectly consistent with his odd interpretation of the 14th Amendment. So, while it is tempting to poke fun at his seeming partisanship on the Cruz vs. Harris question of natural\u2010\u200bborn citizenship, we must give him the benefit of the doubt on that point.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that Eastman is correct on the broader point. Rather than delve into the legal weeds on this issue, which many others have done, I\u2019ll focus instead on some erroneous statements that Eastman makes about American history.\n\nIn his opinion piece, Eastman states that the children of Mexican immigrants born on U.S. soil who were deported during the Mexican Repatriation on the 1920s and 1930s weren\u2019t considered citizens by the government. Eastman wrote:\n\nThe children born on U.S. soil to guest workers from Mexico during the Roaring 1920s were not viewed as citizens, for example, when, in the wake of the Great Depression, their families were repatriated to Mexico.\n\nEastman is incorrect, the government did consider those born to non\u2010\u200bcitizens on U.S. soil to be American citizens. His story about the deportations of Mexicans and American citizens of Mexican descent doesn\u2019t support his point. First, children born in the United States who are minors can follow their parents as they are deported even today. Many today end up staying in the United States with guardians, other relatives, or in the foster care system, but some also leave. Thus, removing or allowing U.S.-born minors to leave with their foreign\u2010\u200bborn parents who are deported doesn\u2019t mean that the U.S. government doesn\u2019t consider the minors to be U.S. citizens.\n\nSecond, many of the U.S.-born children of Mexican immigrants who were deported with their families eventually returned because they were American citizens. For instance, Jose Lopez was born to Mexican parents in Detroit in 1926. He was deported to Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico in 1931 along with his family. As a five\u2010\u200byear\u2010\u200bold, there were few alternatives for him to stay and his parents didn\u2019t want to be separated from their young son. Lopez eventually returned to the land of his birth (the United States) in 1945 as he could prove that he was a citizen, but others were not so lucky. Clearly, the U.S. government considered him to be a U.S. citizen then because he was born here.\n\nThird, the term \u201crepatriation\u201d could be fairly applied to the Mexican\u2010\u200bborn immigrants who were being deported to their homeland, but it was surely inapplicable to the approximately half of all deportees who were American citizens by birth. \u201cMexican Repatriation\u201d is a term commonly used to describe that mass deportation, but it is a phrase that assumes the restrictionist conclusion that all of them were foreign\u2010\u200bborn or non\u2010\u200bcitizens \u2013 which is incorrect because about 60 percent were U.S. citizens with most being born here.\n\nEastman also wrote that the children born to Mexican guest workers under the Bracero guest worker visa program were not considered citizens:\n\nNor were the children born on U.S. soil to guest workers in the bracero program of the 1950s and early 1960s deemed citizens when that program ended, and their families emigrated back to their home countries.\n\nAs far as I can tell from scanning an archive of testimonies by Bracero workers and their families, this isn\u2019t true either. There weren\u2019t many children born on U.S.-soil to Bracero workers because they were supposed to be all men, but children born to illegal immigrants who worked alongside Braceros were citizens, so it stands to reason that so were the few children whose parents were Braceros. Perhaps some U.S.-born children of Braceros were denied citizenship or had trouble proving that they were born in the United States, but I haven\u2019t come across any systematic evidence that the U.S. government did not consider them citizens at the time. I would love to see evidence to the contrary, but I doubt it exists.\n\nConstitutional scholars have been arguing about Eastman\u2019s unorthodox constitutional theories for quite a while and he\u2019s not changing many minds. Interestingly enough, his historical examples do not prove what he thinks they prove.
