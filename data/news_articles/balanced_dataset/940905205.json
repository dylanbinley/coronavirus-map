Of those cases, five are in publicly operated aged care and 2,036 are in privately owned facilities. There are 124 active outbreaks connected to aged care settings.\n\n\u201cThis is a commonwealth-run system but they have asked us to help and we haven\u2019t hesitated,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I say we, it\u2019s not just people at our level, it is also literally hundreds and thousands of nurses who are in their doing amazing work in very, very confronting circumstances.\u201d\n\nAndrews described as \u201cshameful\u201d conditions at a coronavirus stricken aged care home, Kalyna Care, where a 95-year-old woman was left to languish with ants crawling on a wound in her leg.\n\nThe woman, known to her family as Milka, died on Friday morning of conditions unrelated to Covid-19.\n\n\u201cI have not seen the footage but I have been briefed on it, that is just shameful and would be very distressing for everybody concerned,\u201d he said.\n\nIn New South Wales, nine new cases of Covid-19 were recorded.\n\nTwo cases are staff members at Chopstix Asian Cuisine in Smithfield RSL, with the source of one of the cases unknown and the second considered a close contact of the first.\n\nNSW Health said anyone who dined at the restaurant in the days from Friday 31 July to Saturday 9 August was considered a casual contact and should monitor for symptoms, get tested immediately and self-isolate should symptoms occur.\n\nOf the remaining seven cases, one is a student from Tangara School for Girls, one attended Mounties club at Mount Pritchard and five are close contacts of known cases.\n\nNSW Health said one case had dined at Rick Stein at Bannisters in Mollymook on Saturday 1 August.\n\nAnyone who was at the restaurant on this night between 8pm and 10.30pm for at least one hour is considered a close contact and must get tested for Covid-19 immediately and self-isolate until midnight tonight or until they have received a negative result, whichever is later.\n\nVictoria police issued 223 fines in the past 24 hours for breaches of the state\u2019s Covid-19 restrictions, including 27 fines for people who were not wearing a face mask.\n\nRelated: Coalition's homebuilder scheme attracts fewer than 250 applicants and 'no payments have been made'\n\nOne of the men fined lives in Truganina and was allegedly located in Box Hill.
