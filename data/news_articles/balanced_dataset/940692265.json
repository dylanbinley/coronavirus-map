Greece responded by sending its own ships to the area to monitor Turkey\u2019s activities.\n\nErdogan appeared to suggest in a speech to members of his ruling party that the Oruc Reis had come under attack during its expedition and that Turkey had responded accordingly.\n\nGreece denies attack on the Turkish ship\n\n\u201cWe told them, don\u2019t you dare attack our Oruc Reis. You will pay a heavy price if you attack our Oruc Reis, we said. And they got their first answer today,\u201d Erdogan said.\n\nHe provided no detail and immediately moved on to another topic in his wide-ranging address.\n\nIn Athens, the Greek defence ministry denied attacking the Turkish ship.\n\n\u201cNo incident happened,\u201d a Greek defence official said.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Erdogan held talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the European Council chief, Charles Michel, in a bid to defuse the tensions.\n\nErdogan told Merkel \u201che prefers disputes in the eastern Mediterranean are resolved within the framework of international law and on the basis of fairness and dialogue,\u201d the Turkish presidency said in a statement.\n\nThe presidency also said Erdogan insisted to the EU chief that Turkey favoured a solution \u201cwhich will protect the rights of all countries and benefit everyone\u201d and \u201creiterated his commitment to defend Turkey\u2019s rights against attempts to disregard them.\u201d A scramble for the energy riches followed the discovery of hydrocarbon reserves in the eastern Mediterranean, with Greece and Turkey bitterly divided over the issue.\n\nThe EU has watched the rising tensions with concern, urging Turkey to stop its exploration activities.\n\nFrance-Turkey ties have worsened especially after a naval incident in June when Paris accused Turkish ships of being \u201cextremely aggressive\u201d towards a French navy vessel.\n\nThe French government earlier on Thursday further stoked tensions after Paris said it would \u201ctemporarily\u201d reinforce its military presence in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 14th, 2020", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "subject": "Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.", "description": "Greece denies attack on the Turkish ship", "fb": {"app_id": 1383068068604634, "pages": 86398345441}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "DAWN.COM", "url": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1574321", "type": "article", "title": "Erdogan warns of \u2018heavy price\u2019 if Turkish ship attacked", "description": "Greece denies attack on the Turkish ship", "image": "https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/08/5f3600c5e5d99.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@dawn_com", "url": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1574321", "title": "Erdogan warns of \u2018heavy price\u2019 if Turkish ship attacked", "description": "Greece denies attack on the Turkish ship", "image": "https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/08/5f3600c5e5d99.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.dawn.com", "published_time": "2020-08-14 08:11:37", "modified_time": "2020-08-14 08:11:37", "author": "https://www.dawn.com/authors/119/afp"}, "author": "AFP"}}}
