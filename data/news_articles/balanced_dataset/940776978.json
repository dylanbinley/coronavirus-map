He was found dead with stab wounds along with Louie Tagapia, his apartment mate.\n\nPolice and government actions in the wake of the killings have raised immediate questions over whether the death of Echanis is being properly investigated, drawing sharp criticism from rights groups of city and national police along with the country\u2019s justice department.\n\nEchanis\u2019 wife, Erlinda, said her husband\u2019s body had \u201ctorture marks, multiple stab wounds, and gunshot wounds.\u201d\n\nShe told reporters on Monday evening that the Philippine National Police (PNP) \u201cforcibly took\u201d her husband\u2019s body from the family\u2019s chosen funeral home and brought it to another funeral home. Police reportedly said they needed a \u201crelease order,\u201d a document never before known to be required when police handle the dead.\n\nEnjoying this article?

His body is now scheduled for X-ray tests and an autopsy.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get first-read access to major articles yet to be released, as well as links to thought-provoking commentaries and in-depth articles from our Asia-Pacific correspondents.

On Wednesday, however, he indicated the probe would remain with a department task force which has police as members.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access.

According to the human rights group Karapatan, 182 activists and human rights defenders have been killed between July 2016, when President Rodrigo Duterte took power, and June 30, 2020.\n\nAn additional 136 people involved in activism or grassroots work, especially farmers involved in land rights movements, have been killed during that time period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2019, NDFP peace consultant Randy Malayao was shot dead inside a bus in a rural area of Luzon, the country\u2019s largest island. A task force created to investigate his death has not led to any significant breakthroughs.\n\nIn late 2018, human rights lawyer Benjamin Ramos was killed in Kabankalan, a city on the central island of Negros. Police have not identified potential suspects in his death.\n\nThe Philippines has begun probing police involved in potential illegal anti-drug operations after the United Nations urged its government to investigate extrajudicial killings. But the vast majority of drug killings, along with the deaths of political activists, remain unsolved.", "METADATA": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, width=device-width", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"title": "Killing of Philippines Peace Consultant Sparks Scrutiny of Government Investigations", "description": "The death of activist Randy Echanis drew criticism of Quezon City\u2019s police force, along with government probes of politically motivated killings.", "image": "https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/sizes/td-story-s-2/Philippines-Flag2.jpg", "url": "https://thediplomat.com/2020/08/killing-of-philippines-peace-consultant-sparks-scrutiny-of-government-investigations/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Killing of Philippines Peace Consultant Sparks Scrutiny of Government Investigations", "description": "The death of activist Randy Echanis drew criticism of Quezon City\u2019s police force, along with government probes of politically motivated killings.", "image": "https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/sizes/td-story-s-2/Philippines-Flag2.jpg", "url": "https://thediplomat.com/2020/08/killing-of-philippines-peace-consultant-sparks-scrutiny-of-government-investigations/", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The death of activist Randy Echanis drew criticism of Quezon City\u2019s police force, along with government probes of politically motivated killings.", "author": "Nick Aspinwall", "keywords": "Politics,Southeast Asia,Philippines,extrajudicial killings,Philippines activists,Philippines extrajudicial killings,Philippines murdered activists,Randy Echanis", "news_keywords": "Politics,Southeast Asia,Philippines,extrajudicial killings,Philippines activists,Philippines extrajudicial killings,Philippines murdered activists,Randy Echanis", "article": {"tag": "Randy Echanis"}}}}
