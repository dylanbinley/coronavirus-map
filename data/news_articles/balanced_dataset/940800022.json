The measures may be stricter.\n\nThe Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has determined that on the night from Sunday to Monday, a travel warning to avoid traveling to Croatia.\n\nDer Standard, the Kleine Zeitung, as well as other Austrian media, state that \"further details are currently being agreed with the Ministry of Health\".\n\nDer Standard writes that the problem with the \"favourite holiday country\" is that it had 180 newly infected people in 24 hours on Thursday. The media report that Croatia reacted by restricting the operation of bars, cafes, restaurants and nightclubs until midnight.\n\nThey add that the average age of those 180 infected is only 31, and states \"parties are a risk factor\".\n\nAs the latest announcement on its website, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs now states that \"as of August 17, a travel warning is valid for Croatia\".\n\nOn that page, Croatia is still listed as one of the 30 countries from which it is possible to enter Austria without proof of a negative test for Covid-19 and without quarantine.\n\nDer Standard quotes Krunoslav Capak that of the 180 infected on Thursday, \"two-thirds fall on contacts from the Adriatic coast\", as well as criticism from Slovenia that the vast majority of those infected \"have connections to beach parties\" on the Adriatic.", "METADATA": {"keywords": "Croatia news, news from Croatia, news Croatia, headlines Croatia", "title": "Austria issues a travel warning for Croatia as cases rise due to \"beach parties\"", "author": "Mark Thomas", "og": {"url": "https://www.thedubrovniktimes.com/news/croatia/item/9579-austria-issues-a-travel-warning-for-croatia-as-cases-rise-due-to-beach-parties", "title": "Austria issues a travel warning for Croatia as cases rise due to \"beach parties\" - The Dubrovnik Times", "type": "article", "image": "https://www.thedubrovniktimes.com/media/k2/items/cache/6347d192df9ce10bfefd98771866413e_M.jpg", "description": "News from Croatia"}, "image": "https://www.thedubrovniktimes.com/media/k2/items/cache/6347d192df9ce10bfefd98771866413e_M.jpg", "description": "News from Croatia", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "YES", "robots": "index, follow"}}}
