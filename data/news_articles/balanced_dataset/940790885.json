Also known as Martin St\u0159eda, he helped defend the city when under siege by Swedish forces in final stage of the Thirty Years\u2019 War. He is also said to have batted nary an eye in battle, and made a miraculous ascent into heaven immediately when the bloody religious conflict finally ended.\n\nMartin St\u0159eda, source: public domain\n\nMartin St\u0159eda was born in 1587 in the Upper Silesian town of Hlivice, in what is today the Polish town of Gliwice, and was the eldest of three sons. His father was a city councilor and his mother, born Barbora Polednov\u00e1, was the sister of a Jesuit College rector in Prague, where he went to study at the age of seventeen.\n\nHe had to leave Bohemia along with other Jesuits on the basis of a Protestant decree in 1618. Though ordained in Graz and educated mainly in Prague, where he also taught rhetoric and philosophy, Stredonius, as he would become known, made his first vows in Brno already in 1610. And it was in that southern Moravian city where he would leave his mark on history.\n\nLike Stredonius nearly four centuries ago, Jesuit priest Josef Stuchl\u00fd long served as the \u201cstudent chaplain\u201d in Brno. In an interview for a documentary by Czech Television \u2013 which plans to air the consecration of the statue of Father St\u0159eda live on Saturday \u2013 what he means for people today.\n\nJosef Stuchl\u00fd, photo: Official website of Jesuitou dnes\n\n\u201cMartin St\u0159eda was a great person, a man of faith and courage. He was not afraid of the Swedes nor of the worries that life might bring. He was saintly. Then as today, he inspires people through his example.\u201d\n\nIn March 1641, Stredonius returned to Brno for a second spell to serve as rector of the Jesuit College. By the summer of 1645, the Swedish army had seized control of most of Moravia \u2013 but not the city of Brno, which fell under siege for some three months.\n\nHabsburg Imperial Army field marshal Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches was in command of the military, and hopelessly outnumbered by the Swedes. Stredonius and his students rallied townsfolk to defend the city, and their faith, as best they could.\n\nFather Martin Stredonius with a View of Brno from the East, photo: Moravian Gallery\n\nThe French officer later wrote:\n\n\u201cIt appears that the bravery of the city defence was strengthened by fervent prayers and continuous fasting on the part of Father St\u0159eda, through which he transmuted power from heaven to defend and ensure the safety of the besieged. The enemy eventually saw that, having mobilised all their military efforts and set all kinds of traps, the spirit of the city was strong and unbreakable, and that it involved supernatural protection \u2026\u201d\n\nA painting in the Moravian Gallery entitled \u201cFather Martin Stredonius with a View of Brno from the East\u201d depicts Father St\u0159eda\u2019s miraculous ascension to heaven at the very moment the Swedish attackers withdrew at the close of the war. The final and largest cannon ball aimed at Brno is said to have rolled to a stop at his feet.\n\nStatue of Martin St\u0159eda by Jan \u0160eb\u00e1nek, photo: Urban Centrum Brno\n\nWhile the focal point of is of him accepting holy wisdom through the Virgin Mary, and wearing a medallion with a portrait of the Habsburg emperor, in the bottom left-hand corner of the painting a besieger is depicted holding a cannon ball.\n\nOn Saturday, the new bronze statue outside the Jesuit Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in Brno depicts him in prayer.
