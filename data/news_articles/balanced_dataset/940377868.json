Prosecutors, she said, failed to prove that pressing circumstances existed in the case.\n\nStart the day smarter.

He had smoked marijuana earlier in the day.\n\nHis fianc\u00e9e, Cori Sisti, was killed in the crash. She was 23. Their young daughter had to be medevaced to Penn State Hershey Medical Center but survived.\n\nCommon Pleas Judge Michael E. Bortner had denied a motion to suppress the blood test results in the case. He later sentenced Jones-Williams, 32, of Laurel Springs, New Jersey, to serve four to eight years in prison \u2014 plus one year on probation.\n\nBortner acknowledged on appeal that he should have suppressed the evidence. But he asked the appeals court to uphold convictions on some of the lesser charges based on circumstantial evidence, according to the opinion.\n\nDuring the trial, Dorward argued that his client had a minimal amount of THC in the blood and was not impaired. Jones-Williams, he said, did not see the train until right before the crash.\n\nDorward said, if the ruling stands, prosecutors would not be able to move forward on some of the charges against his client. Both sides would then either reach some resolution or have a second trial.\n\nRELATED: York County car-train death: Man sentenced to 4 to 8 years in prison\n\nIn a text message, Kyle King, a spokesperson for the York County District Attorney\u2019s Office, said it has already spoken to Sisti\u2019s family and assured them that \u201cwe will absolutely be appealing.\u201d\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court has to decide whether to take up the case.\n\nSaid King: \u201cThe Office of the District Attorney looks forward to being heard on appeal.\u201d\n\nALSO OF INTEREST: Popular fishing spot is where man was hit, killed by train in York County; resident says barrier needed\n\nContact Dylan Segelbaum at 717-771-2102.\n\nThis article originally appeared on York Daily Record: Man found guilty in car-train crash that killed fianc\u00e9e in York County wins new trial", "METADATA": {"civicscience": {"jspoll-hostname": "www138.civicscience.com"}, "application-name": "Man found guilty in car-train crash that killed fianc\u00e9e in York County wins new trial", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "Transportation", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "The Pennsylvania Superior Court ruled that a judge should've suppressed Akim Jones-Williams' blood test results.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
