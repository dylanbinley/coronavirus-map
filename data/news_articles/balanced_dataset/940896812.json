they will not be able to get into Lebanon, the specificity for the issue at Lebanon is that all these girls are entering into Lebanon legally.\n\n\u201cThere is no human trafficking illegally into Lebanon.\n\n\u201cAbout 90 per cent of the agencies involved in it are Nigerian agencies and they apply through Lebanese agencies in Lebanon through the security general to acquire work visas and work permits for the ladies.\n\n\u201cThis is how it is; so by stopping the issuing of the visas, we would have stopped new cases from arising,\u201d Diab said.\n\nHe noted that out of the estimated 5,000 Nigerians living in Lebanon, majority of them were gainfully employed.\n\nDiab said the Lebanese government and the Nigerian government had successfully evacuated 500 Nigerian ladies from Lebanon with 200 more to be evacuated soonest.\n\nHe noted that the evacuation further showed the strong bilateral relations between the two countries, in spite of the recent explosion in Lebanon.\n\nOnyeama appreciated the Lebanese government and the Lebanese community in Nigeria for their efforts in facilitating the return of the stranded Nigerian girls.\n\nAccording to the minister, the temporary ban on visa issuance will give Nigeria time to review the whole situation and to ensure that we get our labour laws in place.\n\n\u201cAs we battle with the strong involvement of the Embassy in Beirut, the immediate challenge was to repatriate these girls and we would like to offer our profound gratitude to the Lebanese community for their efforts to make available resources to bring these girls back and bring them back fairly quickly.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that enormously because it was a challenge to bring them back.\n\n\u201cThe resources were not there and you very kindly have stepped in and that shows we have a long history between Nigeria and Lebanese communities,\u201d Onyeama said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=1300", "fb": {"pages": 125111084176530, "app_id": 1281965775160257}, "OBKey": "KoeDKhtk63NPK0HQB1Wydg==", "description": "Lebanese Ambassador to Nigeria, Houssam Diab has said that contrary to the assumption, most Nigerians, especially ladies in Lebanon", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Most Nigerian girls in Lebanon not trafficked, Lebanese envoy", "description": "Lebanese Ambassador to Nigeria, Houssam Diab has said that contrary to the assumption, most Nigerians, especially ladies in Lebanon", "url": "https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/08/most-nigerian-girls-in-lebanon-not-trafficked-lebanese-envoy/", "site_name": "Vanguard News", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Houssam-Diab-750x375-1.jpg?fit=750%2C375&ssl=1", "width": 750, "height": 375}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/vanguardngr", "published_time": "2020-08-15T03:40:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T22:38:55+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@vanguardngrnews", "site": "@vanguardngrnews"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "google-site-verification": "AjRfeo4BMZn8J99wiq7X1DKIfO_z-Dnma_6csxvuRRg", "alexaVerifyID": "GKUIyYVwwNAjNpxpU_bP3ZbGFeo", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/favicon.png?fit=16%2C16&ssl=1"}}}
