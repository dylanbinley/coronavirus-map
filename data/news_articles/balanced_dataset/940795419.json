The Belfast outlet is expected to reopen shortly.\n\nSome staff members contacted The Irish Times in recent days to express fears over their jobs, with many concerned that some of the stores and cafes that have reopened may close again.\n\nOne employee, who wished to remain anonymous, said employees working at the Suffolk Street store had not been contacted at all in the five months since the branch shut due to the Covid-19 lockdown.\n\nThe threat of redundancies came just one day after Brown Thomas and Arnotts announced 150 redundancies due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAvoca\u2019s announcement came as its immediate parent Aramark Ireland also warned of being \u201csignificantly impacted\u201d by Covid-19.\n\nDirect provision\n\nThe company, which holds concessions to run a number of direct provision centres and whose other businesses include Campbell Catering, said the coronavirus pandemic had affected all parts of its operations.\n\nDirectors said an unspecified number of employees were currently on the State\u2019s temporary wage subsidy scheme, while the company was being supported by its parent during the pandemic.\n\nAramark Ireland has reported a \u20ac16.2 million pretax loss for its Irish subsidiary for the 12 months ending September 27th, 2019. It attributed the loss to its exit from non-core facilities outside of Ireland, and to continued investment in Avoca.\n\nThe New York-listed group acquired the Avoca business for a reported \u20ac64 million from the Pratt family in 2015.\n\nGroup turnover declined last year to \u20ac335.9 million from \u20ac351.7 million in 2018, as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) fell to \u20ac3.6 million from \u20ac4.9 million.\n\nAramark\u2019s activities cover a wide number of areas including catering, cleaning, facilities, retail and property management.\n\nA breakdown of 2019 turnover shows \u20ac168 million derived from food service, \u20ac82 million through facilities management, \u20ac76 million via retail activities and \u20ac10.3 million from property management.\n\nAramark Ireland employed 5,240 people across the group in 2019, down from 5,417 a year earlier. Staff costs, including wages and salaries, fell from \u20ac149.3 million to \u20ac147.8 million.", "METADATA": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "description": "News comes as parent Aramark Ireland reports loss and also warns of Covid impact", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom14330228"}, "news_keywords": "Business, Services, Campbell Catering, Aramark, Avoca, Ireland", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "all", "og": {"title": "Avoca warns of redundancies due to coronavirus", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/business/retail-and-services/avoca-warns-of-redundancies-due-to-coronavirus-1.4330228", "site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "News comes as parent Aramark Ireland reports loss and also warns of Covid impact", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4330226.1597432553!/image/image.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4330226.1597432553!/image/image.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 329, "width": 585}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IrishTimesBiz", "creator": "@chastaylor", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/business/retail-and-services/avoca-warns-of-redundancies-due-to-coronavirus-1.4330228", "title": "Avoca warns of redundancies due to coronavirus", "description": "News comes as parent Aramark Ireland reports loss and also warns of Covid impact", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4330226.1597432553!/image/image.jpg", "account_id": 15084853}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "fb": {"pages": 45441411157, "app_id": 1170474839675514}}}}
