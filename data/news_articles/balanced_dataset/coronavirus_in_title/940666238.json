That is an equivalent of 73.6 percent of all cases in the continent.\n\nThe five countries also account for 18,594 fatalities on the continent out of 24,288 deaths that have reported to the Africa CDC, or an equivalent of 76 percent of all fatalities.\n\nSouth Africa has lost 11,010 people from COVID-19, Egypt has recorded 5,085 fatalities while Nigeria, Ghana and Algeria have lost 956, 223 and 1,320 people respectively.\n\nSpeaking at a regular press conference in Geneva on Thursday, Dr Michael Ryan, Executive Director, WHO Health Emergencies Program, listed some of the reasons that could explain the high number of deaths and cases in the five countries. World Health Organization Health Emergencies Programme Director Michael Ryan speaks during a news briefing on COVID-19 in Geneva, Switzerland on March 30.AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES\n\nAccording to him, one of the reasons could be high population in those countries. Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, Algeria and Ghana are some of the most populous countries in Africa.\n\n\u201cYou would expect the most cases to be in those countries because that\u2019s where you have the most people,\u201d Dr. Ryan said.\n\nHowever, Nigeria, which has four times more people than south Africa has ten times less deaths and ten times less cases than South Africa. Also, Ethiopia, the second most populous country on the continent has only 463 deaths and 25,118 cases while South Africa has over 11,000 deaths and and more than 568,000 cases with a smaller population.\n\nDr. Ryan also explained that the five countries are more connected with the rest of the world than others and could have imported COVID-19 cases before many other countries.\n\n\u201cSome other factors \u2013 South Africa would have imported the disease much earlier than other countries in the course of this pandemic,\u201d Dr. Ryan said.\n\nHowever, Egypt, which recorded its first confirmed case of coronavirus on February 14, 2020, has less than half of all the deaths in South Africa and five times less cases than those in South Africa.\n\nBesides, Ethiopia, which is one of the most visited countries in Africa, has seen less deaths and less cases than South Africa as well.\n\nDr. Ryan also argued that the five countries also have a better surveillance system and good national labs and may be detecting more cases than some other countries.\n\n\u201cThe absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and in this cases, I think countries with stronger laboratory system tend to find cases more quickly,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Ryan also argued that the large and dense urban populations could also be a factor to consider.\n\n\u201cTheir are large pockets of urban poverty which this disease can spread much more easily,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThese countries are more at risk, these countries have larger populations, these countries have strong surveillance capacity,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO\u2019s COVID-19 technical lead, argued that demographic differences between countries could explain why South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Ghana and Algeria have more cases.
