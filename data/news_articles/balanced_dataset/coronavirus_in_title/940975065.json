We are completely and utterly heartbroken. We will miss you forever. We can't put it into words. Out of respect for Andreea and the shock this has caused for our staff we will be closed today and tomorrow.\"\n\nMrs Maftei's passing brings the official death toll from coronavirus to 558.\n\nHers was the first death to be confirmed by the Department of Health for four days.\n\nThe department confirmed a significant spike of 74 new cases of the virus.\n\nMid and East Antrim has had the highest number of new cases, with 55 recorded in the last week and 75 in the last fortnight.\n\nTributes to the young woman poured into Nobel's Facebook page.\n\nAngelika Andzia wrote: Andreea was the most positive person that I had chance to meet. Heartbreaking news.\"\n\nBallymena businessman Thomas McKillen wrote: \"The Management and staff of McKillens of Ballymena wish to express our deepest sympathy to all in Nobel Cafe on the passing of their colleague Andreea Maftei.\n\n\"We also extend this sympathy to her husband and family. Please take care everyone.\"\n\nMary Cooke posted that \"Auntie Roisin O'Neill will be waiting with open arms... So sorry to the whole of Nobel family and to Andreea's family - may she get the best bed in heaven.\"\n\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said he was saddened by the latest death and rise in cases.\n\n\"I want to express my sincere condolences to the family and friends of the person who has tragically passed away,\" Mr Swann said.\n\n\"This upsetting news serves as a stark reminder that this virus has not gone away.\n\n\"I implore everyone to stick with it. Keep your distance, wash your hands, wear your mask and do not let this virus take a hold in our society. These measures, while simplistic, are essential to winning the battle.\"\n\nBallymena-based SDLP councillor Eugene Reid also expressed his condolences.\n\nHe said: \"Andreea had made Northern Ireland her home and both she and her husband have worked hard for many years to build their life here.\"\n\nBelfast Telegraph", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover", "description": "A 32-year-old woman has become the latest person in Northern Ireland to die after contracting Covid-19.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1229633020, app-argument=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-tributes-to-ballymena-woman-andreea-maftei-after-she-dies-at-age-of-32-39450915.html", "og": {"title": "Coronavirus: Tributes to Ballymena woman Andreea Maftei  after she dies at age of 32", "site_name": "belfasttelegraph", "description": "A 32-year-old woman has become the latest person in Northern Ireland to die after contracting Covid-19.", "url": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-tributes-to-ballymena-woman-andreea-maftei-after-she-dies-at-age-of-32-39450915.html", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/173ec/39450914.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/2020-08-15_new_61290270_I1.JPG", "secure_url": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/173ec/39450914.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/2020-08-15_new_61290270_I1.JPG", "type": "image/png", "width": 1240, "height": 700}}, "fb": {"app_id": 321217294648139}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@BelTel", "url": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-tributes-to-ballymena-woman-andreea-maftei-after-she-dies-at-age-of-32-39450915.html", "title": "Coronavirus: Tributes to Ballymena woman Andreea Maftei  after she dies at age of 32", "description": "A 32-year-old woman has become the latest person in Northern Ireland to die after contracting Covid-19.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/173ec/39450914.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/2020-08-15_new_61290270_I1.JPG", "alt": "Andreea Maftei\u2019s death has shocked friends and colleagues"}, "domain": "BelfastTelegraph.co.uk"}}}}
