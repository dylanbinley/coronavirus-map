He said output of the vaccine could extend to 250 million doses.\n\nAstraZeneca, Britain's second-largest drugmaker, has long operations in Argentina. The company signed a deal with the foundation of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim for production of the vaccine, which is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2021, pending Phase III studies and regulatory approvals.\n\nMexico would provide more details on the agreement on Thursday, said Ebrard, who thanked the Slim foundation for financing production.\n\nFernandez said the deal \"gives Argentina the peace of mind of being able to have the vaccine when required and at a reasonable price.\"\n\nArgentina, which has passed 5,000 coronavirus fatalities, posted a record daily number of COVID-19 infections on Wednesday with 7,663 new cases.
