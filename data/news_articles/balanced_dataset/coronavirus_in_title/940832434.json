The carrier first flew to Islamabad in 1976.\n\nGlobal curbs imposed to fight the pandemic have drastically impacted air travel, placing the future of many airline companies in doubt.\n\nThe UK High Commission wished everyone aboard a great flight on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\"Welcoming back @British_Airways to Pakistan! Keeping the [UK] and [Pakistan] \u2014 and our people \u2014 connected,\" it added.\n\nEarlier, the High Commission had said passengers would be required to wear masks and would have access to hand sanitisers during the flight due to the coronavirus. There were also extra measures in place at the airports to ensure travellers stayed safe.\n\nBritish High Commissioner Christian Turner said this was an important moment for UK-Pakistan links.\n\n\"The resumption of British Airways direct flights is a big boost for the hundreds of thousands of travellers who travel regularly between our two great nations, many who have had their travel plans disrupted by the pandemic.\n\n\"I'd like to thank the Government of Pakistan, British Airways and my team in Pakistan who have worked hard to deliver this welcome news,\" he added.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "TITLE": "British Airways jet takes off from Islamabad as first flight after Pakistan ended coronavirus lockdown | Pakistan | thenews.com.pk", "description": "British Airways had earlier halted operations for Pakistan after restrictions were imposed in a bid to stem the spread of coronavirus", "keywords": "british,airways,takes,islamabad,flight,pakistan,ended,coronavirus,lockdown", "fb": {"app_id": 650123461797330}, "og": {"title": "British Airways jet takes off from Islamabad as first flight after Pakistan ended coronavirus lockdown", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-08-15/l_700557_125020_updates.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-08-15/l_700557_125020_updates.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 390}, "description": "British Airways had earlier halted operations for Pakistan after restrictions were imposed in a bid to stem the spread of coronavirus", "url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/700557-british-airways-jet-takes-off-from-islamabad-in-first-flight-as-pakistan-eases-coronavirus-lockdown", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thenews_intl", "creator": "@Web  Desk", "title": "British Airways jet takes off from Islamabad as first flight after Pakistan ended coronavirus lockdown", "description": "British Airways had earlier halted operations for Pakistan after restrictions were imposed in a bid to stem the spread of coronavirus", "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-08-15/l_700557_125020_updates.jpg?t=121721"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The News International", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#333333", "theme-color": "#000000"}}}
