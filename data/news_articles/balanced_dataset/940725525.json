And I think you\u2019ve really got to extend that philosophy to your customers.\u201d\n\nmedia_camera The sticky date pudding which has been on the menu for more than 10 years.

Sacre bleu!\n\nRestaurants aren\u2019t a library, or a park. We don\u2019t pay for them through taxes, they are someone\u2019s business.\n\nThe tablecloths, hand-polished cutlery, water glasses and staff who hover to fill them up \u2013 all of those things come at a cost, before rent and electricity.\n\nRestaurants operate on small profits. Being asked to respect the business is reasonable .\n\n-Sharnee Rawson", "METADATA": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "referrer": "origin", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/couriermail/ms-icon-70x70.png", "msapplication-square144x144logo": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/couriermail/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/couriermail/ms-icon-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/couriermail/ms-icon-310x310.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/couriermail/ms-icon-144x144.png", "robots": "noarchive", "description": "THERE has been a public backlash against a Brisbane restaurants move to ask all diners to order at least one meal per person.", "keywords": "ordering tap water, public backlash, restaurant owner, sticky date pudding, worst offenders, university students, executive chef, suburban Japanese restaurants, David Pugh, Marc Robertson, Tom Snowdon, Tim Marsden, Martin Duncan, Amy Bates", "generator": "tcog", "articleid": "2c01b8d8e757f9b8aa8197aef992b545", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-13T12:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-08-13T22:04:07.000Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@couriermail", "title": "Knives out for cafe\u2019s \u2018spend more\u2019 ruling", "description": "THERE has been a public backlash against a Brisbane restaurant\u2019s move to ask all diners to order at least one meal per person.", "image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a5c38571ebd415ee80261f1856c4eede"}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Knives out for cafe\u2019s \u2018spend more\u2019 ruling", "description": "THERE has been a public backlash against a Brisbane restaurant\u2019s move to ask all diners to order at least one meal per person.", "url": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/knives-out-for-freestyle-touts-new-spend-more-ruling/news-story/2c01b8d8e757f9b8aa8197aef992b545", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a5c38571ebd415ee80261f1856c4eede", "width": 650, "height": 366}}, "vr": {"canonical": "https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/knives-out-for-freestyle-touts-new-spend-more-ruling/news-story/2c01b8d8e757f9b8aa8197aef992b545"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
