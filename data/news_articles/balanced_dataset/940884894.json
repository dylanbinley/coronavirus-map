If I was to compare my preparation now to when I entered elective politics in 2016, I would say I am more prepared now,\u201d said Brown.\n\nHinds, a former West Indies opening batsman and current president of the West Indies Players' Association, also oozed with confidence following the meeting.\n\nHe said he would be nominated at 10:00 a.m.\n\n\u201cI am pretty confident about winning the constituency. I have gained that confidence from my team that I am working with, and most importantly, from the constituents of Hanover Eastern given that I have been here for two years. I did not just arrive at that position. It is a process that began two years ago,\u201d said Hinds.\n\n\n\nIN PHOTO: Wavell Hinds\n\nWhile expressing concerns about the health of constituents and issues that may arise because of COVID-19, Hinds said he would not like anyone to miss the opportunity to exercise their franchise.\n\n\u201cWe know we have COVID-19, but we need to put the protocols in place so that no one is disenfranchised and no one\u2019s health is compromised at any time at all,\u201d said Hinds.\n\nFollow The Gleaner on Twitter and Instagram @JamaicaGleaner and on Facebook @GleanerJamaica.
