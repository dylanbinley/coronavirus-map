Spain and Belgium have already been added in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cData shows we need to remove France, the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks & Caicos & Aruba from our list of #coronavirus Travel Corridors to keep infection rates DOWN,\u201d Shapps said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cIf you arrive in the UK after 0400 Saturday from these destinations, you will need to self-isolate for 14 days.\u201d\n\nThe French Foreign Ministry gave no immediate reaction.\n\nFrance reported more than 2,500 new COVID-19 infections for the second day in a row on Thursday, levels last seen in mid-April when the country was in the middle of one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns.\n\nThe reimposition of quarantine conditions is hitting Britons\u2019 favourite holiday destinations in the middle of summer and as the travel industry fights for survival.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said his government would be ruthless when it came to imposing fresh restrictions on arrivals because of the danger of importing fresh cases of the virus.\n\nThat approach is in contrast to earlier this year when the government was criticised for being too slow to lock down at the beginning of the pandemic when many cases are thought to have arrived from holidaymakers returning from Italy. The UK\u2019s quarantine policy began in June.\n\nFor UK holidaymakers, France is the second most-visited country behind Spain. France is the second biggest market for tourists coming into the UK, behind the United States.
