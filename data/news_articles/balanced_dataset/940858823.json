(Billy H.C. Kwok/Getty Images)\n\nRogers said the recent arrest of Jimmy Lai, Agnes Chow, and other activists \u201crepresents yet another brazen assault on Hong Kong\u2019s civil liberties and really the death knell for press freedom in particular.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe imposition of this draconian national security law by the national people\u2019s congress on the 1st of July essentially has destroyed Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy,\u201d he said, \u201cIt marks the end of one country, two systems, and places many activists in very grave danger. It is a violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration.\u201d\n\nMedia tycoon Jimmy Lai, owner of Hong Kong\u2019s Apple Daily, and pro-democracy activist Agnes Chow were arrested on Aug. 10 as part of a crackdown under the new national security law. Both were released on bail a few days later.\n\nHong Kong pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai (C) pushes through a media pack to get to a waiting vehicle after being released on bail from the Mong Kok police station in the early morning in Hong Kong on August 12, 2020, after the Apple Daily founder was arrested under the new national security law.

year of the elections disenfranchises Hong Kong people and shuts down one of the few remaining avenues that they had had for some level of freedom of expression,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThese events signify the total takeover of Hong Kong by the Chinese Communist Party system.\u201d\n\nRogers praised the Canadian government for suspending its extradition agreement with Hong Kong over the imposition of the security law, but noted that there\u2019s much more Canada can do to help.\n\nAs well as coordinating with democratic nations on a global response, he encouraged Canada to impose Magnitsky sanctions on the Hong Kong officials responsible for human rights violations and breaching the Sino-British Joint Declaration.\n\n\u201cThe only language they [the Chinese regime] understand is pressure, and targeted sanctions will send a clear signal that they will not be allowed to get away with what they have done with impunity,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also urged Canada to publicly support calls for the establishment of a U.N. special envoy and a U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cShining a spotlight on Hong Kong through a monitoring and reporting mechanism in the U.N. would be very important in ensuring that human rights abuses are not perpetuated with impunity,\u201d he said.\n\nLastly, he urged Canada to \u201cwork with other countries to \u2026 ensure those who do need to escape from Hong Kong are offered sanctuary and an opportunity to seek citizenship in the free world.\u201d\n\nRogers said the crisis in Hong Kong should concern Canada because the Sino-British Joint Declaration is an international treaty.\n\n\u201cThe Sino-British Joint Declaration is not only an agreement between the U.K. and China, but it is an international treaty that concerns all of us who believe in an international rules-based system,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Aug. 9, the Five Eyes countries, of which Canada is a member, urged the Hong Kong government to uphold the city\u2019s democratic process and hold the elections as soon as possible.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, along with the U.S. secretary of state, issued a joint statement expressing concerns over the \u201cunjust disqualification of candidates and disproportionate postponement of Legislative Council elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe the time has come for the free world to act in defence of freedom and democracy, human rights, and the international rules-based order, and that action should be as strong, targeted, and united as possible,\u201d Rogers said.", "METADATA": {"msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/assets/themes/eet/images/EET270.png", "viewport":
