But they have had divergent political paths since emerging as independent states in August 1947. India defied early skepticism, remained united, and mainly a secular democracy. In contrast, Pakistan struggled under military rule and with the politicization of religion.\n\nHowever, based on recent events in India, the political paths of the two countries appear to be converging.\n\nThe West lauds India as the world\u2019s largest democracy \u2013 a refreshing contrast to the string of dictatorships in Pakistan. It views free and fair elections, an independent election commission, a commitment to freedom of speech, press, and association, civil society, and thriving NGOs as the hallmarks of India\u2019s democracy.\n\nYet, prominent Indians have criticized the recent actions of the Modi government. Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen described last year\u2019s decision of the Modi government to revoke the special status of Indian Kashmir as contrary to \u201cdemocratic norms.\u201d Sen also said that the preventive detentions of Kashmiri leaders were a \u201cthrowback to the British Raj.\u201d\n\nEminent academic Pratap Bhanu Mehta wrote in October that \u201cthe noose is tightening around all independent institutions in India.\u201d Mehta mentioned \u201cthe cowardly, almost impeachable, abdication of the judiciary in the face of threats to civil liberties.\u201d He was referring to the episode about the sedition charges (now withdrawn) against prominent writers and directors.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi plans to attend the groundbreaking ceremony Wednesday for a Hindu temple in Ayodhya. The temple is on a disputed site in northern India where Hindu hard-liners tore down a 16th-century mosque in 1992. For Modi, who is wildly popular with his Hindu-first base, it\u2019s another opportunity to project his nationalist credentials.\n\nAccording to Modi\u2019s allies, the date chosen for the ceremony is astrologically auspicious for Hindus. It\u2019s expected to bring about an awakening of the feeling of Hindutva, or the Hindu way of life.\n\nThe temple event is yet another sign that the Indian national identity is becoming overtly majoritarian. There was a time that India prized its inclusive identity that set aside religious, caste, class, or ethnic differences. The truth is that India has become less pluralist and tolerant since Modi came to power.\n\nModi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) enjoys virtual electoral hegemony by winning most of the Hindu vote. Hindus make up about 80 percent of the Indian electorate. But in catering to its Hindu base, the BJP is moving away from the \u201cone state, one law, and one national community for the whole land\u201d concept that India\u2019s founders rightly saw as the strength of a hugely diverse country like India.\n\nIn sharp contrast to Modi, in 1951, India\u2019s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the visionary democrat and secularist, described the ideal state as one in \u201cwhich the state protects all religions, but does not favor one at the expense of others and does not itself adopt any religion as state religion.\u201d\n\nChester Bowles, the then United States Ambassador to India, wrote of Nehru: \u201cone of his greatest achievements is the creation of a secular state in which the forty-five million Muslims that choose not to go to Pakistan may live peacefully and worship as they please.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that India and Pakistan have extreme levels of poverty and inequality. Political corruption and criminalization, violence based on caste, gender, and religion are major challenges for both countries. Although India has a better record than Pakistan in the treatment and protection of minorities, critics have called this record into question since the Modi government came to power.\n\nWhile India has performed better on most democratic indicators than Pakistan, it must guard against the erosion of fair and uncompromising public institutions. Otherwise, it risks becoming an \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d or an \u201celection-only democracy\u201d\n\nWhile India has performed better on most democratic indicators than Pakistan, it must guard against the erosion of fair and uncompromising public institutions. Otherwise, it risks becoming an \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d or an \u201celection-only democracy.\u201d\n\nMuch like Pakistan, where fragile democratic institutions have been so irreversibly damaged by authoritarian rule and religious obscurantism, that support for democracy has thinned. It\u2019s an example that India would hardly wish to emulate.\n\nIn pursuit of its grand goal to join the ranks of global superpowers, India should remain mindful of not sacrificing its past democratic successes. In Pakistan, civilian supremacy over non-democratic institutions remains the prerequisite to the advancement of genuine democracy.\n\nBoth countries must recognize that the passing forward of inclusive and law-driven democratic systems to future generations is a lofty end in itself.\n\n(This article was first published in The Globe Post on August 04, 2020)\n\nThe writer is an analyst and commentator on politics, peace, and security issues.
