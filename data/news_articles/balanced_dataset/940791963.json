It had all to do with the health system and COVID-19 and giving the space to the victims of COVID-19 but, by the way, the crime situation benefited out of that.\"\n\nWATCH: Cele releases crime stats for Q1 2020/2021\n\nThis article first appeared on EWN : SA's crime situation benefited from alcohol sales ban, says Cele", "METADATA": {"description": "The Police Minister Bheki Cele released the latest available crime statistics for offences committed from April to June this year.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"title": "SA's crime situation benefited from alcohol sales ban, says Cele", "site_name": 702, "description": "The Police Minister Bheki Cele released the latest available crime statistics for offences committed from April to June this year.", "type": "website", "image": "http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/v1596192320/pxfoaptfnsbgtyyzgulx.jpg", "url": "https://www.702.co.za/articles/393066/watch-live-cele-releases-crime-stats-for"}, "fb": {"app_id": 470753673045582}, "twitter": {"title": "SA's crime situation benefited from alcohol sales ban, says Cele", "url": "https://www.702.co.za/articles/393066/watch-live-cele-releases-crime-stats-for", "site": "@Radio702", "app": {"country": "ZA", "name": {"iphone": "702 App", "googleplay": "702 App"}, "id": {"iphone": 789681404, "googleplay": "za.co.primedia.702"}}, "description": "The Police Minister Bheki Cele released the latest available crime statistics for offences committed from April to June this year.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/v1596192320/pxfoaptfnsbgtyyzgulx.jpg"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=789681541", "google-play-app": "id=za.co.primedia.talkradio", "ArticleID": 393066, "Section": "Article"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
