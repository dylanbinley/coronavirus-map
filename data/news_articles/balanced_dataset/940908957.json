Through National Heritage Week 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s free, is a great way to fuel curious minds and might even inspire your next staycation.\n\nTaking place from today, Saturday 15 August, until Sunday 23 August, National Heritage Week has had to take on a different approach for 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThis year, local heritage groups, families and communities have developed online projects around this year\u2019s theme of \u2018Heritage and Education: Learning from our Heritage\u2019. There are more than 400 projects available on HeritageWeek.ie, and you can even filter projects by county or theme depending on your interests.\n\nTo get you started, here are nine things to experience online this National Heritage Week.\n\n1. Be a beekeeper for the day (kind of)\n\nSource: Shutterstock/kosolovskyy\n\nYou won\u2019t have to worry about getting stung on this virtual walk with the North Kildare Beekeepers\u2019 Association. Taking place today on Facebook, experts in honeybees and other pollinators will suit up, open a live beehive and showcase what goes on in there. Viewers can even ask questions throughout the event, so bee prepared.\n\nFind out more information here.\n\n2. Go on a virtual bat walk in Co Limerick\n\nA one-of-a-kind experience, Limerick City and County Council \u2013 in collaboration with Vincent Wildlife Trust \u2013 have produced Ireland\u2019s first virtual bat walk. The walk is through Coillte\u2019s Curraghchase Forest Park and details how to use a bat detector, and includes footage of various bat species.\n\nHead along on the walk here.\n\n3. Delve into the history of Glasnevin Cemetery\n\nSource: William Murphy\n\nSince the first burial took place in 1832, over 1.5 million have been laid to rest at Glasnevin Cemetery. This project is based on a selection of artefacts and memorials that are linked to the cemetery and its museum, and tells the story behind each object. Chosen items include a trowel used to lay the foundation stone of the O\u2019Connell Tower, and the badge of a munition worker (someone whose job it is to supply ammunition and equipment to troops) during WWI.\n\nFind out more about the project here.\n\n4. Take a tour of Medieval Dublin\n\nOrganised by The Friends of Medieval Dublin, the group\u2019s popular walking tours will be available online this Heritage Week. Several virtual walks are taking place throughout the week, including a trip to where the heart of medieval Dublin was situated and the street where you can see remains of a medieval wall. There\u2019s also a quiz about the capital\u2019s history as a medieval city, if you want to test your knowledge.\n\nDiscover the details here.\n\n5. Discover a WWI gun battery on Bere Island, Co Cork\n\nSource: Shutterstock/Timaldo\n\nDue to its history as a base for the British military during WWI, there are plenty of stories to be told about Bere Island. One of these surrounds Lonehort Battery, which is the largest of seven gun batteries on the island constructed to protect British battleships while they were anchored nearby. Lonehort Battery has remained untouched over the years, with the first phase of restorations available for viewing as part of the project on its history.\n\nView the completed project here.\n\n6. Learn about the Irish legacy of the Bronte family\n\nDid you know that the Brontes (the famous 19th century literary family) have links to Ireland? Charlotte Bronte married Offaly man Arthur Bell Nicholls in 1854, and they are said to have had their honeymoon here. After Charlotte and her father died, Arthur returned to Banagher town in 1861, taking with him several pieces of the family\u2019s memorabilia. For this Heritage Week project, the Crafting Group in Banagher are going to make images of 15 key items he took in needlework. Those interested can also join an online talk about the objects on August 13 at 3pm.\n\nFind out all of the details here.\n\n7. Celebrate Ireland\u2019s first female botanist\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEllen Hutchins (1785-1815) was born in Bantry Bay, Co Cork and is widely regarded as Ireland\u2019s first female botanist. The festival that celebrates her life and work is running across the same week as National Heritage Week, and includes several online activities, from an Introduction to Botanical Recording webinar to a mini seaweed identification guide to a journey along the Ellen Hutchins Heritage Trail.\n\nAll of the details are available here.\n\n8. Discover Bram Stoker\u2019s link to Sligo\n\nWhile many people know about Dublin being Bram Stoker\u2019s birthplace, his connection to Sligo is lesser-known. Find out about it in an online presentation, which details how Sligo\u2019s cholera epidemic helped to inspire some of the themes in Dracula.\n\nView the completed project here.\n\n9.
