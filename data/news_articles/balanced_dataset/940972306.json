Their main [opponent] party is the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, which represents the vast majority of Afghans,\u201d he tweeted in Dari and Pashto languages, referring to the Taliban\u2019s persistent failure to start discussions with the Afghan government.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid asserted in a statement that the group does not recognize the \u201cKabul administration\u201d as a government and views it as a \u201cwestern imported structure\u201d working for the continuation of \u201cAmerican occupation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe only accept and have made preparations for negotiations that were described in the historic Doha agreement and those are intra-Afghan negotiations that cover all parties to the Afghan conflict,\u201d he said.\n\nThis comes days after President Ashraf Ghani approved the release of the remaining 400 Taliban prisoners in a bid to pave the way for direct talks with the insurgents.\n\nThe release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners in return for 1,000 captive Afghan security personnel was agreed in a landmark deal between the US and the Taliban in February as a condition for the intra-Afghan talks.\n\n\u201cNow, the Taliban have a choice \u2013 they must demonstrate they are not afraid of a comprehensive cease-fire. There is no great bravery required for war, but for peace,\u201d Ghani said while addressing the closing ceremony of the consultative assembly, Loya Jirga, last week.\n\nAt the extraordinary moot, over 3,000 public figures from across the country backed the government\u2019s calls for a permanent cease-fire and international guarantees that the insurgents would not resort to violence again and commence intra-Afghan talks.\n\nCopyright 2020 Anadolu Agency.
