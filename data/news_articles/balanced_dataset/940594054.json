Monaco will join them in being taken off.\n\nThe decision is a blow in particular for the French tourist industry, as well as holidaymakers from UK who are already across the channel or have trips booked in coming weeks.\n\nThe UK\u2019s decision would lead to a reciprocal measure, the French junior minister for European affairs, Cl\u00e9ment Beaune, suggested late on Thursday, adding that France regrets the move.\n\nGrant Shapps, the transport secretary, was among ministers who had agreed on Wednesday to remove the Netherlands, Malta, Turks and Caicos and Aruba, but they were still mulling over plans for France. It is understood that Johnson intervened to pause plans on Wednesday evening so more time could be given to analyse Covid cases in France to see whether it should be removed.\n\nRt Hon Grant Shapps MP (@grantshapps) Data shows we need to remove France, the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks & Caicos & Aruba from our list of #coronavirus Travel Corridors to keep infection rates DOWN. If you arrive in the UK after 0400 Saturday from these destinations, you will need to self-isolate for 14 days.\n\nAfter further consideration on Thursday evening, which took into account the latest daily coronavirus infections in France and successive post-lockdown record rises, the government decided it was time to act.\n\nNick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said: \u201cWhile we support evidence-based measures at the border, it\u2019s vital that the government has a joined-up strategy, and recognises the impact of this on travel-related businesses. It is vital that a sector-specific deal is put in place urgently.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat the government has still not put in place an effective track, trace and isolate system has made matters far worse and made it more likely that we are reliant on the blunt tool of 14-day quarantine.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe government should publish all of the scientific evidence its decisions are based on and details of any work being done to reduce the time needed to isolate through increased testing and other measures.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Thursday during a visit to Northern Ireland, Johnson said: \u201cWe have got to be absolutely ruthless about this, even with our closest and dearest friends and partners. I think everybody understands that.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe will be looking at the data a bit later on this afternoon, looking exactly where France and other countries are getting to. We can\u2019t be remotely complacent about our own situation.\n\n\u201cEverybody understands that in a pandemic you don\u2019t allow our population to be reinfected or the disease to come back in. That is why the quarantine measures are very important and we have to apply them in a very strict way.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s transport secretary, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, said that he had spoken to Shapps about the decision. He tweeted: \u201cFrance regrets the British decision and will apply reciprocal measures in terms of transport.\n\n\u201cI told my counterpart Grant Shapps of our will to harmonise health protocols in order to ensure a high level of protection on both sides of the Channel.\u201d\n\nThe Foreign Office has also updated its travel advice to advise against all but essential travel to the six locations. Ministers have acted after the Joint Biosecurity Centre and Public Health England noted a \u201csignificant change\u201d in the destinations\u2019 Covid-19 risk.\n\nIn France, there has been a 66% increase in newly reported cases over the past week and a 52% increase in the weekly incidence rate per 100,000 people, according to data highlighted by the Department for Transport. Meanwhile, in the Netherlands there has been a \u201cconsistent increase\u201d in newly reported cases over the past four weeks with a 52% increase in newly reported cases in the past week, the department added. In the past week there has been a 273% increase in newly reported cases in Turks & Caicos, a 1,106% increase in Aruba and 105% increase in Malta, figures show.\n\nOn Thursday, France recorded 2,669 new Covid-19 cases, a post-lockdown record high, up from 2,524 on Wednesday. This figure topped the 2,288 cases on Friday and was followed by 2,184 infections on Saturday, 1,885 on Sunday and 785 on Monday \u2013 when the country\u2019s health ministry reported the first significant rise in the number of people in hospital due to Covid-19.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, France\u2019s 14-day cumulative number of Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people reached 32.1 as of Thursday, compared with the UK\u2019s 18.5.\n\nThe Netherlands had a rate of 40.2 per 100,000 over 14 days, and Malta had a rate of 74.8 per 100,000. Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain are among countries already removed from England\u2019s safe list, with the snap exit of the last of these, with just a few hours\u2019 notice, in July causing chaos for holidaymakers.\n\nIndividual decisions on whether or not to remove countries are taken by devolved administrations but the latest move is being made by all four administrations. England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all moved last Thursday to announce the imposition of quarantine measures on arrivals from Belgium, Andorra and the Bahamas.", "METADATA": {"description": "Travellers arriving from France after 4am on Saturday will need to quarantine for 14 days", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Simon Murphy", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4459d1b253d3e115b87dd55b4fb03a788ced6e62/0_259_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a64dc924c4710ab2eedc4a79d6470c39", "keywords": "Coronavirus outbreak,Netherlands,Malta,France,Health policy,Travel & leisure,Europe,Health,Society,World news", "news_keywords": "Coronavirus outbreak,Netherlands,Malta,France,Health policy,Travel & leisure,Europe,Health,Society,World news", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/13/netherlands-and-malta-set-added-england-quarantine-list-coronavirus", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4459d1b253d3e115b87dd55b4fb03a788ced6e62/0_259_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e08f7163357b016539def06cacc23cde", "description": "Travellers arriving from France after 4am on Saturday will need to quarantine for 14 days", "type": "article", "title": "UK adds France to Covid-19 14-day quarantine list", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simon-murphy", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "World news", "published_time": "2020-08-13T23:28:09.000Z", "tag": "Coronavirus outbreak,Netherlands,Malta,France,Health policy,Travel & leisure,Europe,Health,Society,World news", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T13:28:39.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2020/aug/13/netherlands-and-malta-set-added-england-quarantine-list-coronavirus?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2020/aug/13/netherlands-and-malta-set-added-england-quarantine-list-coronavirus?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/13/netherlands-and-malta-set-added-england-quarantine-list-coronavirus", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2020/aug/13/netherlands-and-malta-set-added-england-quarantine-list-coronavirus?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4459d1b253d3e115b87dd55b4fb03a788ced6e62/0_259_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=6a4c2c086356db7db88d421a6cb3e386", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@murphy_simon", "dnt": "on"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}}}
