According to them, if they are not successful in the impending elections, they will return to their respective districts and lead their people.\n\nThey also defended by saying if they resign as requested by aggrieved Liberians, there will be by-elections as well. Based on this, they said their decision is patriotic and not wasteful.\n\nAfter taking over as President of Liberia, President George Weah told the Liberian people and the international community that the governing Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) was taking over a broke economy.\n\nThe Liberian leader and his financial experts have repeatedly said they are challenged because the country doesn't have the resources to undertake most of the development projects, but continue to lobby with her international community for funding.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Liberia Governance By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.
