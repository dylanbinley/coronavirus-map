The agreement also does not commit the government of Israel to negotiations guided by the internationally agreed parameters.\"\n\n'Height of treachery'\n\nIn May 2018, South Africa withdrew its ambassador from Israel following the killing of more than 55 Palestinians during the Great March of Return in Gaza.\n\nThough the ambassador, Sisa Ngombane, later returned to Israel for personal matters, when his term was up, the South African government said it would not be sending a new representative to Tel Aviv, in accordance with resolutions adopted by the ruling of the African National Congress (ANC) in December 2017 to turn the embassy into a \"liaison office\u201d.\n\n\"We are in the process of following the downgrade resolution of the ruling party and stage one has been completed,\" said Lindiwe Sisulu, minister of international relations and cooperation.\n\nCommenting on Pretoria's move at the time to sever relations with Tel Aviv, Gideon Levy, the Israeli author, wrote: \"South Africa, in a move that generates respect, is teaching Israel an important lesson about instilling the legacy of the past and learning its lessons. By cutting off ties with an occupying, apartheid state, it\u2019s telling Israel: We've learned the lessons of our past. What about you?\"\n\nThe UAE and Israel: More than a marriage of convenience Read More \u00bb\n\nOn Friday, a group of protesters held a demonstration outside the Israeli embassy in Johannesburg. Protesters from the Africa for Palestine group as well as trade unions, stood six feet apart, held placards and chanted over a megaphone.\n\nMandela, a proponent of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS), said it was for good reason that his grandfather, Nelson Mandela, had declared Palestine the greatest moral issue of our time.\n\n\"Those who legitimise apartheid Israel will themselves become the victims of its nefarious ambitions of a greater Israel. We will stand in solidarity with the Palestinians and we will stand for justice and human rights for all,\" he said.\n\nMandela's comments were echoed by anti-apartheid stalwart and former government minister, Ronnie Kasrils.\n\nKasrils told Middle East Eye the move showed that a \"Machiavellian choreography is under way\".\n\n\"It is yet another disgraceful milestone in the sordid history of shameful deals in the entire region ... it is important that people around the world, who believe in justice for Palestine, protest and invigorate the BDS campaign to isolate Israel, condemn America's sustained military aid, and denounce those collaborationist Arab regimes,\" Kasrils said.\n\nMeanwhile, the South African BDS coalition told MEE that the deal \"was the height of treachery\".\n\n\"The UAE has been conniving with the US and Israel to undermine the Palestinian people and act as a stalking horse for other countries such as the murderous Saudi Arabian regime.\n\n\"This is extremely dangerous for the Palestinians and the region. We urge the international community to vociferously reject this Faustian pact and to stand with the Palestinian people in their struggle for justice and a meaningful peace,\" the group said.", "METADATA": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Grandson of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela says anyone who believes normalisation will advance peace is living\u00a0in 'fool's paradise'", "title": "UAE-Israel deal will not advance peace in Middle East: Mandla Mandela", "creator": "@middleeasteye", "url": "http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-israel-not-advance-peace-middle-east-mandla-mandela"}, "og": {"site_name": "Middle East Eye", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-israel-not-advance-peace-middle-east-mandla-mandela", "title": "UAE-Israel deal will not advance peace in Middle East: Mandla Mandela", "description": "Grandson of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela says anyone who believes normalisation will advance peace is living\u00a0in 'fool's paradise'", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/images-story/South%20Africa%20palestine%20protest.jpg", "url": "http://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/images-story/South%20Africa%20palestine%20protest.jpg"}}, "description": "Grandson of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela says anyone who believes normalisation will advance peace is living\u00a0in 'fool's paradise'", "fb": {"app_id": 882711278504931}, "generator": "Drupal 8 (http://drupal.org)", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/middleeasteye/"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
