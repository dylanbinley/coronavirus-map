Simon Lalong, in a statement in Jos, expressed concern over Mailafia\u2019s allegation and demanded an urgent probe to ascertain the veracity or otherwise of the claim.\n\nMailafia, who was invited by the Department of State Services over the allegation, was, however, released yesterday after six hours of interrogation.\n\nIn a related development, Benue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, has urged the federal government to allow those he described as responsible citizens to bear weapons such as AK-47 rifles to protect themselves as part of measures to curb the rising insecurity in the country.\n\nMailafia, who was the presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) in 2019 presidential election, in an interview with a broadcast station, whose video later went viral, had said he had a chat with two repentant Boko Haram members who named a northern governor as a commander of the terror group.\n\nHe said the terrorists and bandits were one and the same, adding that the terrorists moved weapons even during the lockdown imposed by the federal government to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe ADC, however, described as mischievous the reproduction of Mailafia\u2019s audio interview, saying the interview was misrepresented and reproduced without his consent.\n\nThe party added that while it was its position that the Buhari administration seemed to be paying lip service to combating crime on all fronts, Mailafia\u2019s remarks were sensationalised.\n\nThe Department of State Services (DSS), however, invited Mailafia over the allegation.\n\nIn the wake of the DSS\u2019 invitation to Mailafia, the governors tasked the security agency to thoroughly probe the allegation.\n\nLalong said: \u201cThe forum, which has been working with the federal government, security agencies, community, civil society, traditional and religious leaders as well as development partners to defeat terrorism, banditry and other forms of criminality in the region finds the allegation by Dr. Mailafia very weighty, which deserves further investigation.\n\n\u201cWe as Northern governors have met severally to discuss insecurity in the Northern region and the nation at large where we did not only condemn the activities of terrorist groups such as Boko Haram, bandits, armed robbers, kidnappers, and other criminals, but also engaged the president and all heads of security agencies in finding solutions to the problem. To now say that one of our members is leading Boko Haram in Nigeria is a serious allegation that cannot be swept under the carpet. We demand an immediate and thorough investigation.\u201d\n\nThe northern governors also urged Mailafia and all citizens with useful information on the activities of criminals and terrorist groups to assist security agencies and governments at all levels with such intelligence for proper action.\n\nThe governors also wondered if \u201csuch allegations are not smear campaigns or attempts to discourage the Northern governors who are putting in their best to bring an end to insecurity in the region.\u201d\n\nLalong added that the governors do not, and will not support the activities of any criminal group, adding that governors and their families are also not spared as was recently witnessed when the convoy of Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum was attacked.\n\nOrtom Wants FG to Allow Responsible Citizens Carry AK47 Rifles\n\nThe Benue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, has urged the federal government to allow responsible citizens to protect themselves with weapons such as AK-47 rifles as part of measures to curb the rising insecurity in the country.\n\nThe governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Terver Akase, titled, \u2018National Security: Gov Ortom Proposes The Way Forward,\u2019 urged the federal government to grant licences to responsible citizens to carry sophisticated weapons to deter criminals from attacking innocent and helpless Nigerians.\n\nHe said the policy should be backed by a strict legal framework to prevent illegal possession of arms by the citizenry without exception.\n\nHis recommendations were part of his submission in a paper Ortom presented yesterday during the virtual meeting convened by Centre for Values in Leadership, CVL, in collaboration with Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF).\n\nIn the paper titled: \u2018Insecurity and Governance Challenges in the New Normal,\u2019 the governor said governments at all levels must come to terms with the fact that insecurity is a real threat to development of the country and be willing to sincerely tackle the menace.\n\nHe also recommended adequate funding of security agencies and continuous training of their personnel to enable them to be abreast of global dynamics in the fight against insecurity.\n\nThe governor urged the federal government to embrace ranching as it is the global best practice of animal husbandry and enact a law to end open grazing, which often comes with attacks on farming communities by armed herdsmen militia.\n\nOrtom also advocated improved educational standards and enhanced public enlightenment campaigns to give the people, particularly youths the needed orientation to shun negative acts and become more patriotic.\n\nHe called for the repositioning of National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) through training, funding and logistics to successfully confront drug barons and peddlers; a move he said would stop illegal drugs from entering and circulating in the country.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2018/09/3117fafc-mr-simon-lalong.jpg", "secure_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2018/09/3117fafc-mr-simon-lalong.jpg", "width": 942, "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Northern Govs Demand Probe of Member\u2019s Alleged Backing for Terrorists - THISDAYLIVE", "description": "\u2022Ortom wants FG to allow responsible citizens to carry arms \u2022DSS releases Mailafia By Seriki Adinoyi in Jos and George Okoh in Makurdi Northern Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) has called on security agencies to investigate the allegation by a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr. Obadiah Mailafia that one of them \u2026", "url": "https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/08/13/northern-govs-demand-probe-of-members-alleged-backing-for-terrorists/", "site_name": "THISDAYLIVE", "updated_time": "2020-08-13T02:53:53+00:00"}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thisdaylive", "section": "Latest", "published_time": "2020-08-13T02:52:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T02:53:53+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2022Ortom wants FG to allow responsible citizens to carry arms \u2022DSS releases Mailafia By Seriki Adinoyi in Jos and George Okoh in Makurdi Northern Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) has called on security agencies to investigate the allegation by a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr. Obadiah Mailafia that one of them [\u2026]", "title": "Northern Govs Demand Probe of Member\u2019s Alleged Backing for Terrorists - THISDAYLIVE", "site": "@thisdaylive", "image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2018/09/3117fafc-mr-simon-lalong.jpg", "creator": "@thisdaylive"}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
