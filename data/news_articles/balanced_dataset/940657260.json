Bobby Powell, along with Reps. Dianne Hart, Susan Valdes, Kimberly Daniels, and Wengay Newton, were unsparing in their rhetoric about a prison system that failed citizens it is supposed to be rehabilitating.\n\nPowell, of Palm Beach County, stressed his own connection to the disease, having lost a longtime friend to COVID-19.\n\n\u201cEach person that\u2019s incarcerated is someone\u2019s family and should be seen as more than a number,\u201d Powell said.\n\nPowell urged, again, releasing those who are medically compromised, noting other states have released imperiled prisoners.\n\nHart, of the Tampa area, noted the pandemic has killed more than 8,000 Floridians, amid a \u201clack of leadership in the Florida prison system.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur prison medical system was already experiencing difficult challenges, so imagine what COVID is doing,\u201d Hart added.\n\n\u201cOne-fourth of the population is in medical quarantine, but not one is eligible for medical [conditional] release,\u201d the legislator added, noting efforts to appeal to Gov. Ron DeSantis and Surgeon General Scott Rivkees have been ignored.\n\nValdes, also of Tampa, said \u201ca lot of inmates do not report their symptoms in fear that they would not be treated or would be put in a hole.\u201d\n\nPatients coming from prisons, she said, had to be put on ventilators, a procedure that required them to be removed from shackles.\n\n\u201cConditions in Florida prisons were ripe to exacerbate the pandemic and now we are seeing the results,\u201d Valdes said, saying nonviolent inmates slated for release should have those releases expedited.\n\nDaniels, of Jacksonville, pointed to a preponderance of letters she\u2019s received from inmates.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a pandemic in a prison, it\u2019s a problem. A big problem,\u201d she said, noting families are cut off from their loved ones, who all too often are \u201csitting, waiting for their last breath.\u201d\n\nJuvenile facilities, said Newton, are faring little better, with COVID-19 surging through those facilities as well.\n\nThis article first appeared at Florida Politics.\n\nSupport local journalism in these crazy days.
