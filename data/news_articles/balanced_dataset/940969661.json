However it was not defined officially until the past century.\n\nIn 1950, Pope Pius XII made an infallible, ex-cathedra statement in the Apostolic Constitution Munificentissimus deus officially defining the dogma of the Assumption.\n\n\u201cBy the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by our own authority, we pronounce, declare, and define it to be a divinely revealed dogma: that the Immaculate Mother of God, the ever Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory,\u201d the pope wrote.\n\nThe decree was seen as the formalizing of long-held Christian teaching.\n\n\u201cWe have throughout the history of the Church an almost universal attestation of this,\u201d Bunson said of the Assumption.\n\n\u201cWe have this thread that runs throughout the whole of the history of the Church in support of the dogma. That\u2019s significant because it supports the tradition of the Church, but it also supports a coming to a deeper understanding of the teachings of the Church of how we rely upon the reflections of some of the greatest minds of our Church.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s also notable about the dogma, he added, is that it \u201cuses the passive tense,\u201d emphasizing that Mary did not ascend into heaven on her own power, as Christ did, but was raised into heaven by God\u2019s grace.\n\nToday, the Feast of the Assumption is marked as a major feast day and a public holiday in many countries. In most countries, including the United States, it is a Holy Day of Obligation.\n\nBunson explained that on major feast days, it\u2019s fitting to mark the significance of the feast as especially vital by emphasizing the necessity of celebrating the Eucharist that day.\n\n\u201cWhat is more fitting than on the Assumption of the Blessed Mother to, once again, focus on her Son, on the Eucharist?\u201d he asked.\n\n", "METADATA": {"description": "VATICAN CITY \u2014 On the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Pope Francis said that Mary\u2019s assumption into Heaven was an infinitely", "og": {"title": "Pope: Mary's Assumption was a 'giant leap for mankind'", "image": "http://catholicsentinel.org/Images/Images/139421.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@", "title": "Pope: Mary's Assumption was a 'giant leap for mankind'", "description": "VATICAN CITY \u2014 On the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Pope Francis said that Mary\u2019s assumption into Heaven was an infinitely greater achievement than man\u2019s first steps on the moon.", "image": "http://catholicsentinel.org/Images/Images/139421.jpg"}}}}
