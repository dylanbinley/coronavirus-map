Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) pauses while speaking as Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) listen during a news conference\n\nIn 2018, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley won their congressional seats running on progressive platforms against more establishment Democrats. Omar ran to fill a vacant seat but AOC, Tlaib, and Pressley primaried sitting Dems and won. And after cleaning up in a round of contentious primary elections this summer, The Squad has proven that their 2018 wins were anything but a fluke.\n\nSquad . cc @ilhanmn @ayannapressley @rashidatlaib Squad . cc @ilhanmn @ayannapressley @rashidatlaib A post shared by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@aoc) on Nov 12, 2018 at 3:21pm PST\n\nA lot of money went into trying to keep these women to a single term.\n\nIn June, AOC won her primary against Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, a Reagan-loving self-described \u201ccentrist\u201d whose campaign was largely funded by Wall Street titans. Ocasio-Cortez won with nearly 73% of the vote.\n\nWhen I won in 2018, many dismissed our victory as a \u201cfluke.\u201d Our win was treated as an aberration, or bc my opponent \u201cdidn\u2019t try.\u201d So from the start, tonight\u2019s race was important to me. Tonight we are proving that the people\u2019s movement in NY isn\u2019t an accident. It\u2018s a mandate. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) June 24, 2020\n\nLast week, Tlaib won her primary with two-thirds of the vote. And in the most contentious race of them all (Pressley appears to be running unopposed in her race next month), Ilhan Omar won her race yesterday with 57% of the vote.\n\nLike AOC\u2019s challenger, Omar\u2019s opponent, attorney Antone Melton-Meaux, was well-funded by moderate to right-wing donors. All of these women have been attacked for being too progressive. They\u2019ve been accused of focusing too much on national issues (which sure sounds like code for the familiar refrain of \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d). They are seen as a threat not just to Republicans but to anyone who benefits from wealth inequality and any other form of social injustice. And those people have a lot of resources to throw behind a candidate who will serve them.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why the narrative going into these races (and even after them) is that these women were in real danger of losing their seats and that they were lucky to win.\n\nThis is what \u201csurviving\u201d a primary challenge looks like to the very smart, very unbiased folks at Politico https://t.co/cUZkFc1fdX pic.twitter.com/0pkquKsxvO \u2014 Rose Movement \ud83c\udf39 (@Rosemvmt) August 11, 2020\n\nIn reality, as Rep. Tlaib said in a statement following her win, \u201cVoters sent a clear message that they\u2019re done waiting for transformative change, that they want an unapologetic fighter who will take on the status quo and win.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the four existing squad members, this summer\u2019s primary season added two new progressive voices likely to win their general elections in November: Missouri\u2019s Cori Bush and New York\u2019s Jamaal Bowman.\n\nI want folks to recognize how big of a triumph @IlhanMN\u2019s victory represents. Tens of millions in big money was targeted to unseat 3 of us as \u201csafe\u201d Dems \u2013 almost unheard of. This is what happens you deeply challenge systems of power and corruption. But the people triumphed. https://t.co/adVnV6wGGR \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) August 12, 2020\n\nIn Minnesota, we know that organized people will always beat organized money. Tonight, our movement didn\u2019t just win. We earned a mandate for change. Despite outside efforts to defeat us, we once again broke turnout records. Despite the attacks, our support has only grown. \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) August 12, 2020\n\n(image: Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images)\n\nWant more stories like this?
