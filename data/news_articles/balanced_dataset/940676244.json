The chairman of the commission constituted in relation to affairs of a province shall be appointed by the Governor on advice of the Chief Minister.\n\nThe commission shall perform such functions as may be prescribed by\n\nlaw. The apex court also pointed out that the appointments in the anti-corruption watchdog are governed by the rules, which have not been framed even after 21 years of the promulgation of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999.\n\nSection 34 of the NAO says the NAB chairman may, with the approval of the President, by notification in the official Gazette, make rules for carrying out the purposes of this law.\n\nWhile hearing different cases, the Supreme Court has repeatedly pointed out that the NAB has not framed the needed rules. It has stressed that the rules be prepared without delay.\n\nHowever, it has not been done. In the instant case, the court was also informed that the rules have not yet been prepared.\n\nIt was told that Mangi was appointed by the NAB chairman in exercise of powers conferred on him under Section 28 (g) of the NAO.\n\nHowever, this very provision is also governed by the nonexistent rules. It says the NAB chairman shall not be required to consult the public service commission for making appointments on matters relating to qualifications for such appointments and method of their recruitment and the qualifications for appointments and methods of recruitments shall be such as he may by rules prescribe.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "TITLE": "Can NAB bypass Constitution in making appointments, asks SC | Peshawar | thenews.com.pk", "description": "ISLAMABAD: The appointments in the federal and provincial governments including the National Accountability Bureau  are required to be made under an act of the respective legislature and through the...", "keywords": "bypass,constitution,making,appointments,asks", "fb": {"app_id": 650123461797330}, "og": {"title": "Can NAB bypass Constitution in making appointments, asks SC", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 390}, "description": "ISLAMABAD: The appointments in the federal and provincial governments including the National Accountability Bureau  are required to be made under an act of the respective legislature and through the...", "url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/700382-can-nab-bypass-constitution-in-making-appointments-asks-sc", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thenews_intl", "creator": "@TBTariq Butt", "title": "Can NAB bypass Constitution in making appointments, asks SC", "description": "ISLAMABAD: The appointments in the federal and provincial governments including the National Accountability Bureau  are required to be made under an act of the respective legislature and through the...", "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=115714"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The News International", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#333333", "theme-color": "#000000"}}}
