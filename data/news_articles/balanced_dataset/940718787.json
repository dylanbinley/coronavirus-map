(AP)\n\nA deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates intended to fully normalise relations follows a history of peace efforts between Israel and the Palestinians and their Arab allies that have failed to overcome decades of distrust and violence.\n\nMost Arab nations, including the UAE, have not recognised Israel or had formal diplomatic or economic relations with it because of what they regard as Israel\u2019s thwarting of Palestinians\u2019 aspirations for a state of their own.\n\nHere are the main initiatives undertaken by the parties themselves and international mediators since the 1967 Middle East War, when Israel captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the Sinai peninsula and the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights:\n\n1967 \u2013 UN Security Council Resolution 242\n\nAfter the Six-Day War, U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 calls for the \u201cwithdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\u201d in return for all states in the area to respect each other\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence.\n\nThe resolution is the foundation for many peace initiatives but its imprecise phrasing \u2013 is the reference to all territories or just some? \u2013 has complicated efforts for decades.\n\n1978 \u2013 Camp David agreement\n\nIsrael\u2019s Menachem Begin and Egypt\u2019s Anwar Sadat agree on a framework for regional peace that calls for an Israeli withdrawal in stages from Egypt\u2019s Sinai and a transitional Palestinian government in the West Bank and Gaza.\n\n1979 \u2013 Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty\n\nThe first peace treaty between Israel and an Arab country sets out plans for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Sinai within three years. in 1981, Sadat was assassinated by Islamist revolutionaries at a military parade in Cairo.\n\n1991 \u2013 Madrid summit\n\nRepresentatives of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) attend a peace conference. No agreements are reached but the scene is set for direct contacts.\n\nRead: How world reacted to the US-brokered peace agreement\n\n1994 \u2013 Israel-Jordan agreement\n\nJordan becomes the second Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel. But the treaty is unpopular and pro-Palestinian sentiment is widespread in Jordan.\n\n1993-1995 \u2013 Declaration of Principles/Oslo Accords\n\nIsrael and the PLO hold secret talks in Norway that result in interim peace accords calling for the establishment of a Palestinian interim self-government and an elected council in the West Bank and Gaza for a five-year transitional period, Israeli troop withdrawals and negotiations on a permanent settlement.\n\n2000 \u2013 Camp David summit\n\nU.S. President Bill Clinton convenes Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at Camp David. They fail to agree. Another Palestinian uprising ensues.\n\n2002-2003 \u2013 Bush Declaration/Arab peace initiative/Road Map\n\nGeorge W. Bush becomes the first U.S. president to call for the creation of a Palestinian state, living side-by-side with Israel \u201cin peace and security\u201d.\n\nRead | Hamas slams UAE-Israel deal to establish ties\n\n2002 \u2013 Saudi Arabia presents Arab League-endorsed peace plan for full Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory and Israel\u2019s acceptance of a Palestinian state in return for normal relations with Arab countries. The United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia present their own roadmap to a permanent two-state solution to the conflict.\n\n2007 \u2013 Annapolis summit\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert fail to reach a deal at a U.S.-hosted summit. Olmert later says they were close to a deal but a graft investigation against him and a Gaza war in 2008 scupper any agreement.\n\n2009 \u2013 Netanyahu\u2019s Bar-Ilan address\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he would be prepared for a peace deal that includes the establishment of a demilitarised Palestinian state. He also sets another condition: Palestinian recognition of Israel as the \u201cstate of the Jewish people\u201d.\n\nRead | Joe Biden says UAE-Israel ties a \u2018historic step\u2019\n\n2013 \u2013 2014 \u2013 Washington peace talks/negotiations collapse\n\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry coaxes Israelis and Palestinians to resume talks. They fail and are suspended in April 2014.\n\nJune 2019 \u2013 Trump economic plan announced\n\nJared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, launches its preliminary stage in Bahrain. He takes an \u201ceconomy first\u201d approach, calling for a $50 billion investment fund to boost the Palestinian and neighbouring Arab economies. Palestinian leaders dismiss it.\n\n2019\n\nNetanyahu says he intends to annex West Bank settlements, and much of the Jordan Valley if elected. Later, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo effectively backs Israel\u2019s claimed right to build Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank by abandoning a four-decade-old U.S. position that they were inconsistent with international law.\n\nArab League head Ahmed Aboul Gheit says in June 2019 the only acceptable resolution for Arab states is Israel\u2019s acceptance of the initiative drawn up by Saudi Arabia in 2002.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
