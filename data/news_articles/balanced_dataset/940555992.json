Devotees do not use fire in the kitchen on this day. Therefore, the food is prepared on the previous day of Sashti. The complainant, a resident of the city\u2019s Sabarmati area, told the police that she was asked to make tea by her mother-in-law. She refused it, saying that it was Sheetala Satam, therefore, she cannot use the stove. A heated argument broke out between the woman and her mother-in-law, in front of her husband, who then thrashed her.\n\nMother-in-law gives stick to woman's husband\n\nLater, the complainant left the house and headed to a tea stall in the vicinity of their house. Her husband and mother-in-law followed her. They allegedly dragged her to the house after hitting her with a stone. The mother-in-law then gave a stick to the woman\u2019s husband, who then brutally thrashed her with it after putting chilli powder on her private parts, according to a report by Ahmedabad Mirror.\n\nThe complainant said that her husband and mother-in-law have been torturing and harassing her since the birth of her son. Several times in the past, she had left her matrimonial house to live with her parents but came back every time.\n\nAnother incident\n\nIn another incident, a 40-year-old man allegedly slit his 35-year-old wife's throat after an argument over less sugar in tea in Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh in June. The couple's children were sleeping. They got up on hearing their father's screams. As they rushed to the kitchen, they noticed their mother lying in a pool of blood and gasping for breath.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "https://www.timesnownews.com/mirror-now/crime/article/gujarat-man-puts-chilli-powder-on-wife-s-private-parts-for-refusing-to-make-tea/636632", "type": "Article", "title": "Gujarat: Man puts chilli powder on wife\u2019s private parts for refusing to make tea", "description": "A man allegedly thrashed his 23-year-old wife with a stick after putting chilli powder on her private parts in Ahmedabad on Monday.", "image": "https://imgk.timesnownews.com/story/iStock-601387064_1.jpg?tr=w-560,h-292,fo-top"}, "description": "A man allegedly thrashed his 23-year-old wife with a stick after putting chilli powder on her private parts in Ahmedabad on Monday.", "news_keywords": "Domestic violence, Crime, Crimes against women, Ahmedabad, Domestic Violence, Man beats wife, Man thrashes wife, Sheetala Satam, Ahmedabad news, chilli powder, sexual torture", "keywords": "Domestic violence, Crime, Crimes against women, Ahmedabad, Domestic Violence, Man beats wife, Man thrashes wife, Sheetala Satam, Ahmedabad news, chilli powder, sexual torture", "fb": {"app_id": 2051731518430427, "pages": 218735715310}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Gujarat: Man puts chilli powder on wife\u2019s private parts for refusing to make tea", "description": "A man allegedly thrashed his 23-year-old wife with a stick after putting chilli powder on her private parts in Ahmedabad on Monday.", "image": "https://imgk.timesnownews.com/story/iStock-601387064_1.jpg", "site": "@TIMESNOW", "creator": "@TIMESNOW"}, "theme-color": "#254A96", "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
