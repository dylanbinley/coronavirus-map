Our identity is not a crime. Nevertheless, one faces three years in prison for this fact in Poland,\u201d a speaker told the crowd waving rainbow flags and fans and carrying banners with slogans in Czech, English and Polish.\n\nThe protesters also chanted \u201cFree Margot\u201d and \u201cYou never stand alone\u201d in a reference to the accused Polish activist, Margot Malgorzata Szutowicz.\n\nMargot is a trans nonbinary person who uses the pronoun she, the Prague meeting\u2019s initiators have written on Facebook.\n\nSzutowicz\u2019s release was recently demanded by Dunja Mijatovic, the Council of Europe commissioner for human rights, who said her detention has sent an unfortunate signal about the freedom of speech and LGBT people\u2019s rights in Poland.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The demonstration followed the arrest of a female LGBT activist in Poland", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Prague protesters express support for LGBTQ community in Poland - Prague, Czech Republic", "description": "The demonstration followed the arrest of a female LGBT activist in Poland", "url": "https://news.expats.cz/weekly-czech-news/prague-protesters-express-support-for-lgbtq-community-in-poland/", "site_name": "Expats.cz Latest News & Articles - Prague and the Czech Republic", "image": {"identifier": "https://news.expats.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/iStock-1150309387.jpg", "secure_url": "https://news.expats.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/iStock-1150309387.jpg", "width": 1254, "height": 836, "alt": "Rainbow flags at a Prague Pride parade via iStock / Anna Chaplygina", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/expats.cz/", "section": "In the News", "published_time": "2020-08-10T08:44:35+02:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 437940896249661}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Prague protesters express support for LGBTQ community in Poland - Prague, Czech Republic", "description": "The demonstration followed the arrest of a female LGBT activist in Poland", "image": "https://news.expats.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/iStock-1150309387.jpg"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://news.expats.cz/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cropped-expatscz-proifle-512-270x270.jpg"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
