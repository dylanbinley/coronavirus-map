She found the DNA of Sunny and Jacob Cayer.\n\n#JacobCayerMurderTrial After analyzing the tire iron found in the Teague home, Lind says she found a mix of two DNA profiles, Heesun Teague's DNA is the major contributor.

Lind testified that they test DNA against an internal database to make sure there is no cross-contamination. The samples were not entered into the federal database.\n\nCayer\u2019s DNA was not found on a shovel Joel Kennedy testified he used to knock down Cayer.\n\n#JacobCayerMurderTrial defense says the blade and handle of shovel was important to test, Lind agrees.\n\nDefense: Mr. Cayer's DNA is not on the shovel, correct?\n\nLind: Yes, he was excluded from all comparisons I made. \u2014 Brittany Schmidt (@BritSchmidtNews) August 12, 2020\n\n#JacobCayerMurderTrial defense asks about tire iron.\n\nDefense: on cayer's hands, we don't have any Heesun DNA or Kennedy DNA.\n\nLind: no, based on the swabs taken on his hand \u2014 Brittany Schmidt (@BritSchmidtNews) August 12, 2020\n\nAfter a lunch break, Cayer was first questioned by the state, which started off with telling Cayer that Wednesday is a big day because he\u2019ll get to tell the jury what happened.\n\n#JacobCayerMurderTrial This is Jacob Cayer as he is being escorted out of the courtroom for a lunch break.

But he says 'remember there is a witness, Joel Kennedy.' \u2014 Brittany Schmidt (@BritSchmidtNews) August 12, 2020\n\nIn opening statements Monday, Brown County District Attorney Dave Lasee said Jacob Cayer turned the Teague home into a \u201creal life horror movie.\u201d Lasee said the scene was gruesome and there was \u201cblood everywhere.\u201d Lasee said Cayer killed Sunny Teague with a tire iron before going after Sabrina and Joel Kennedy.\n\nThe defense asked jurors to keep an open mind and to remember there are \u201ctwo sides to every story.\u201d\n\nAlso Monday, survivor Joel Kennedy took the witness stand after opening statements. Kennedy, who was dating Sabrina Teague at the time of the attack, identified Cayer as the man who attacked them on June 7, 2016.\n\nKennedy testified that he and Sabrina arrived at Sunny\u2019s home that evening to check in on her. Kennedy says the shower was running. Sabrina went to check on her mother and found her in the bathroom with stains on the floor. He says Cayer emerged from a laundry room and attacked them.\n\nCLICK HERE for full coverage of Kennedy\u2019s testimony.\n\nKennedy says Cayer attacked Sabrina before stabbing him with a kitchen knife. Kennedy testified that he put up his arm and the blade went through. His chest was also injured. Kennedy fell back and started kicking and punching. Cayer went after Sabrina and Kennedy ran to the garage to get a shovel. Cayer and Sabrina followed to the garage. Kennedy grabbed a shovel and hit Cayer in the face with it. Kennedy ran inside the home, locked the door and called 911. While in the home, he saw a body in the bedroom wrapped in a blanket. He believed that to be Sunny Teague.\n\nThe defense questioned Kennedy about what they describe as \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in his statements and the timeline of the attack. On the stand, Kennedy said Sabrina was attacked first. His initial statement said he was attacked first.\n\nThe defense also asked Kennedy about why he was carrying a knife. Kennedy said that he worked at Burger King and used the knife to break down boxes. Kennedy said the knife was also for self-protection.\n\nThe defense also asked Kennedy why he ran inside the home after hitting Cayer with the shovel. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Kennedy answered. He said it happened very fast and he was responding on instinct.\n\nOn Tuesday, the prosecution focused on the 10-hour interview between Brown County Sheriff\u2019s Office Sgt. Zachary Holschbach and Cayer.\n\nCLICK HERE for full coverage of DAY 2 of the JACOB CAYER TRIAL.\n\nHolschbach testified that he first came in contact with Cayer in the Emergency Room, and Cayer was \u201ccovered in dry-brownish/red, consistent with blood.\u201d Holschbach stated that Cayer was handcuffed to a gurney. The sergeant stated that he wanted to assess Cayer to see if he was capable of talking to him. Holschbach testified that if he believed Cayer was not able to have a conversation or respond coherently, he would have waited to interview him. However, he stated that was not the case. He read Cayer his Miranda Rights.\n\nThe defense asked Holschbach if he believed Cayer was mentally competent to be interviewed at the time. The defense asked if Cayer expressed confusion about what happened. Holschbach replied, \u201cYes, he expressed confusion.\u201d\n\nCayer\u2019s trial is scheduled to go through Friday, Aug. 14. Brown County Circuit Court Judge Tammy Jo Hock is presiding.\n\nCayer has been in and out of competency since charges were filed in 2016. Last November, a judge ordered Cayer to a mental health institution and to take medication against his objections.\n\nCayer demanded to be found competent and for his trial to move forward. The court ruled he was competent to stand trial.\n\nCayer has been through several attorneys, which has also delayed the case.\n\nAction 2 News will continue to update this developing story.\n\nCopyright 2020 WBAY.
