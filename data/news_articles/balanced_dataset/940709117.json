The White House urged him to reconsider. He pressed on.\n\nNow it is revealed that, as part of the agreement with the UAE, Israel has agreed to \u201csuspend declaring sovereignty\u201d over areas outlined in Trump\u2019s January plan. Netanyahu later said he remains \u201ccommitted\u201d to annexation, but the joint statement about today\u2019s agreement says that Israel will \u201cfocus its efforts now on expanding ties with other countries in the Arab and Muslim world.\u201d\n\nIn a sense, this is a concession to both the White House and to America\u2019s Arab allies, which saw annexation as Israel\u2019s way of setting the borders of a future Palestinian state and dooming a two-state solution. But in a more important sense, this \u201cconcession\u201d is a fig leaf.\n\nFor the Gulf States in particular, normalization of ties with Israel has historically been tied to the full withdrawal of forces to the pre-1967 lines and recognition of a Palestinian State. These principles were affirmed almost two decades ago through something known as the Arab Peace Initiative. The UAE had previously endorsed that initiative. Now the UAE and Israel have agreed to sign agreements to establish reciprocal embassies in their countries without any agreement for Israel to remove its forces from the West Bank.\n\nThe UAE is not the first Arab country to formally recognize Israel. Egypt signed the Camp David Accords in 1979 in return for the Sinai, while Jordan signed its agreement in 1994 at the height of the Oslo Peace Process. It\u2019s notable that the UAE has signed its agreement with Israel when there are no peace negotiations whatsoever.\n\nAnd that is the most striking element of the normalization agreement. It reflects two realities of today\u2019s Middle East: First, Israel and most Gulf states have been quietly cooperating for the past 20 years. The Israelis and the Emiratis in particular have shared intelligence and private diplomatic initiatives to roll back Iranian influence in the region.\n\nWe are deeply grateful to our readers & viewers for their time, trust and subscriptions.

Israel had nothing to do with the collapse of the U.N.-recognized government in Yemen \u2014 the Iranian-supported Houthis did. Israel had nothing to do with the collapse of Syria \u2014 that was the fault of the country\u2019s dictator, Bashar al-Assad. And Israel had nothing to do with the rise of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. In all of these cases, the regimes and groups most vocally opposed to Israel also served as the region\u2019s chief arsonists.\n\nThis is something Arab leaders in the region understand better than many advocates for Palestinian sovereignty in the West. As Osama bin Laden once observed, \u201cWhen people see a strong horse and a weak horse, by nature they will like the strong horse.\u201d In assessing the region, the UAE\u2019s leaders have seen one state thrive as its neighbors burned. They have chosen the strong horse. \u2013 Bloomberg\n\nAlso read: This is what Israel, UAE and US get from the diplomatic breakthrough in Middle East\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram\n\nNews media is in a crisis & only you can fix it You are reading this because you value good, intelligent and objective journalism.
