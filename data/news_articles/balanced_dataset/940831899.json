A Bangladesh spokesman says today, \"If there has to be any talk with Pakistan it would have to be on equal terms. Mr Bhutto has spoken of 'authorities of Dacca'. He cannot just deal with 'authorities' in Bangladesh. He must talk with the prime minister of Bangladesh. To refuse to do that is to ignore hard facts and realities.\n\n\"When he talks of 'authorities of Dacca' does Mr Bhutto still think Bangladesh as a part of his own domain? As he still seems to be unwilling to recognise the sovereignty of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman has no alternative but to refuse to meet him. Once the condition is accepted, Sheikh Mujib is willing to talk on all problems of mutual interest,\" adds the spokesman.\n\nYUGOSLAVIA'S SUPPORT TO BANGLADESH UN MEMBERSHIP\n\nYugoslavia fully supports Bangladesh's application for membership of the United Nations, reports PTI. Official circles in Belgrade emphasises that UN membership for Bangladesh is not only logical in view of the hard fact of the existence of the new state and its recognition by many countries, but also necessary as a contribution to peaceful development in that vital part of the world.\n\nSOURCES: August 16, 1972 issues of Bangladesh Observer, Dainik Bangla and Dainik Ittefaq.", "METADATA": {"p": {"domain_verify": "2422553b8bf6981167b94995534f77f3"}, "yandex-verification": "ce13aea75f0df09a", "google-site-verification": "cNkGc0BVTjxXsgsdm7W8ycbai8edcXsO0NawiUYUfbQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "description": "August 15, 1972 BANGABANDHU TO LEAVE FOR GENEVA ON AUGUST 21 Prime Minister Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman will leave London for Geneva on August 21 to recuperate from his gallbladder surgery.
