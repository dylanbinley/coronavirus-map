Not another conspiracy theory being validated?\u201d\n\nThe caption links to a website called Australian National Review which features a response by a \u201cretired paediatrician from New York\u201d on the risk of being more susceptible to coronavirus infections from the flu shot.\n\nThe August 9 post has received more than 270 shares and more than 27,000 views.\n\nA post claims studies show the flu shot will increase a person\u2019s susceptibility to COVID-19.\n\nThe Analysis\n\nThe post falsely claims medical studies show the flu shot increases the risk of testing positive for COVID-19. There is no evidence to support the claim, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and two experts contacted by AAP FactCheck. Influenza and COVID-19 are caused by different viruses and flu vaccines contain attenuated or killed influenza viruses which won\u2019t give people COVID-19 or make them more susceptible.\n\nThe post\u2019s claim is from the website Australian National Review which republished a comment on an editorial in the British Medical Journal from February 2020.\n\nResponding to Public Health Wales\u2019 consultant epidemiologist John Watkins\u2019 editorial on other methods to control COVID-19 outbreaks, Allan S. Cunningham, a retired paediatrician from New York, said there is a \u201cpossibility that seasonal flu shots are potential contributors to the current outbreak\u201d.\n\nCunningham cited a study published in 2012 of a trial which examined whether 115 children vaccinated with the 2008-09 influenza vaccine had a higher chance of being infected with other respiratory diseases.\n\nHe claimed from the trial \u201cflu shots increased fivefold the risk of acute respiratory infections caused by a group of non-influenza viruses, including coronaviruses\u201d.\n\nThe CDC stated in April 2020 there is no evidence that \u201cgetting a flu vaccine increases the risk of getting COVID-19\u201d. The CDC\u2019s advice is supported by NSW Health who state there is \u201cno evidence yet directly linking flu vaccination with an increased risk of COVID-19\u201d.\n\nIn August 2020, the CDC said in an article titled, \u201cMisconceptions about Seasonal Flu and Flu Vaccines\u201d that flu vaccines are \u201cnot thought to make people more susceptible to other respiratory infections\u201d.\n\nThe CDC referred to the flu vaccination study published in 2012 and concluded: \u201cIt\u2019s not clear why this finding was detected in the one study, but the majority of evidence suggests that this is not a common or regular occurrence and that flu vaccination does not, in fact, make people more susceptible to other respiratory infections,\u201d it said.\n\nProfessor Robert Booy, an infectious diseases paediatrician from the University of Sydney, told AAP FactCheck via email there is no evidence that the flu vaccine increases a person\u2019s risk of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThese viruses are completely different from each other and there\u2019s no reason biologically or, theoretically, to believe that giving one vaccine will increase the risk of another disease,\u201d he said.\n\nAssociate Professor Margie Danchin, a vaccine researcher from Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute and the University of Melbourne, told AAP FactCheck: \u201cYou can\u2019t get the flu from the influenza vaccine. You certainly can\u2019t get coronavirus from a killed influenza vaccine.\u201d\n\nShe said the study published in 2012 was a \u201cvery small study to be drawing such large conclusions\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no relationship really that can be drawn from this study to the COVID-19 situation whatsoever.\u201d\n\nProf Booy agreed and told AAP FactCheck the study was conducted nearly 10 years ago and \u201cis quite different from the COVID-19 (coronavirus) and has absolutely no relevance to the present day\u201d.\n\nDr Danchin said the study was investigating a phenomenon called \u201cviral interference\u201d to examine whether boosting the body\u2019s immunity against one type of virus will change the body\u2019s ability to effectively respond to other types of viruses.\n\n\u201cThe study says there was only one coronavirus infection detected, and it was called NL63, which has no relationship to the current coronavirus. Making a connection to COVID-19 from this paper is impossible,\u201d she said.\n\nProf Booy described the study as an \u201coutlier\u201d, saying there needed to be confirmation from \u201ctwo or three other studies before you\u2019d be worried\u201d.\n\nAn infectious diseases expert told AAP FactCheck there\u2019s no evidence that a flu shot raises a person\u2019s risk of COVID-19.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "AustralianAssociatedPress", "url": "https://www.aap.com.au/no-evidence-to-link-flu-vaccinations-to-increased-covid-19-risk-say-experts/", "title": "No evidence to link flu vaccinations to increased COVID-19 risk, say experts", "description": "A Facebook post claims medical studies show the flu vaccination will increase a person's susceptibility to COVID-19.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/aap-nw-aap.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/14173513/53906f8634c938a5a37239ac95ef08798c75578badc249dcc2a3875e514566e8-scaled.jpg?v=1597390517", "width": 500, "height": 500}, "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AAPNewswire", "url": "https://www.aap.com.au", "title": "Australian Associated Press", "description": "Trusted, accurate and impartial", "card": "summary"}}}}
