Dr Bloomfield and other Ministry of Health officials will meet with the Cabinet before a decision is announced.\n\n\"We don't know yet the extent of the outbreak - that's our absolute priority - find the extent and ring-fence it,\" Dr Bloomfield told The AM Show on Thursday.\n\n\"By the middle of the day tomorrow [Friday] we will have a lot more information from the testing that's been happening both in Auckland and around the country, and that will be hugely helpful in terms of our advice to the Government on what to do next.\"\n\nUnder alert level 3, people are told to stay in their household bubbles. Gatherings of up are only permitted for wedding services, funerals, and tangihanga.\n\n\"If there's a gathering greater than the permitted size then, yes, we may enter and deal with the situation - using powers of entry is the last resort - normally we can go and knock at the front door and have a conversation and we sort it out, so I believe that power was used only once or twice in the previous lockdown,\" Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said on Thursday.\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday night Auckland entering alert level 3 was a \"precautionary measure\". The word \"precautionary\" is being used in Government messages for a reason, Prof Gillespie said.", "METADATA": {"description": "Auckland on Wednesday was placed into an alert level 3 lockdown.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "uumI2OyeOotXTsQTpam2IRld56y7UffZn_SC9xkj8Jo", "hideAds": "false", "keyword": "sensitive,laws,government,auckland,new-zealand", "adTargeting": "sect1=new-zealand>sect2=coronavirus-covid-19-law-much-better-than-the-first-lockdown-government-has-raft-of-power-expert>tags=sensitive,laws,government,auckland,new-zealand>article-content-type=video>pagetype=content", "designPath": "/common/", "commonDesignPath": "/common/", "og": {"title": "Coronavirus: COVID-19 law 'much better' than the first lockdown, Government has 'raft of power' - expert", "description": "Auckland on Wednesday was placed into an alert level 3 lockdown.", "type": "article", "site_name": "Newshub", "url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2020/08/coronavirus-covid-19-law-much-better-than-the-first-lockdown-government-has-raft-of-power-expert.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2020/08/coronavirus-covid-19-law-much-better-than-the-first-lockdown-government-has-raft-of-power-expert/_jcr_content/par/video/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1597273881998/al-gillespie-paul-henry-1120.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1120, "height": 640}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T11:11:54+12:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T11:11:22+12:00", "section": "NZ"}, "sitename": "newshub", "brandname": "newshub", "pageName": "new-zealand:2020:08:coronavirus:-covid-19-law-'much-better'-than-the-first-lockdown,-government-has-'raft-of-power'---expert", "pageType": "content", "primaryContentType": "video", "articleId": "coronavirus-covid-19-law-much-better-than-the-first-lockdown-government-has-raft-of-power-expert", "articleTitle": "Coronavirus: COVID-19 law 'much better' than the first lockdown, Government has 'raft of power' - expert", "articleCategory": "new zealand", "breadcrumb": "New Zealand>2020>08>Coronavirus: COVID-19 law 'much better' than the first lockdown, Government has 'raft of power' - expert", "endpoint": "Newshub Web", "mwEnableHeaderBidding": "true", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@NewshubNZ", "title": "Coronavirus: COVID-19 law 'much better' than the first lockdown, Government has 'raft of power' - expert | Newshub", "description": "Auckland on Wednesday was placed into an alert level 3 lockdown."}, "fb": {"pages": 314879818534}, "liveUpdatesEnabled": "true"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": true, "NOTES": []}}
