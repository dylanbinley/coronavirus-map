They announced it in a joint statement, saying deals between Israel and the UAE were expected in the coming weeks in such areas as tourism, direct flights and embassies.\n\nTrump called the deal \u201ca truly historic moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that the ice has been broken I expect more Arab and Muslim countries will follow the United Arab Emirates,\u201d he told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nIn a nationally televised news conference, Netanyahu echoed Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cToday we usher in a new era of peace between Israel and the Arab world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a good chance we will soon see more Arab countries joining this expanding circle of peace.\u201d\n\nBut Netanyahu said the annexation plan was on \u201ctemporary hold,\u201d appearing to contradict statements from Emirati officials who said it was off the table.\n\nEmirati officials described the deal in pragmatic terms. Anwar Gargash, a top Emirati official, said they had dealt a \u201cdeath blow\u201d to an aggressive Israeli move and hoped to help reshape the region.\n\n\u201cIs it perfect? Nothing is perfect in a very difficult region,\u201d Gargash added. \u201cBut I think we used our political chips right.\u201d\n\nOmar Ghobash, assistant minister for culture and public diplomacy, told The Associated Press: \"I don\u2019t think anything was written in stone. We are opening a door. We are hoping the Israelis will see the benefits to this step.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would assume that this is political maneuvering within a very complex political society,\" he added.\n\nIsrael and the UAE do not share a border and have never fought a war. But the UAE, like most of the Arab world, long rejected diplomatic ties with Israel in the absence of a peace deal establishing a Palestinian state on lands captured by Israel in 1967.\n\nThat steadfast support for the Palestinians, however, has begun to weaken in recent years, in large part because of the shared enmity toward Iran and Iranian proxies in the region. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the day-to-day ruler of the UAE, also shares Israel\u2019s distrust of Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Gaza Strip\u2019s ruling Hamas militant group.\n\nNetanyahu has long boasted about fostering closer behind-the-scenes ties with Arab countries than publicly acknowledged. The UAE has made little secret of those budding ties, allowing Israeli businessmen to enter the country on foreign passports and welcoming Israeli officials and sporting figures. Next year, Israel will take part in the UAE\u2019s delayed Expo 2020, the world\u2019s fair being hosted by Dubai. A secret synagogue also draws practicing Jews in Dubai.\n\nStill, the timing of the deal was unexpected, and perhaps tied to the upcoming U.S. election.\n\nFor Trump, it gave an important boost to a president trailing in opinion polls and facing heavy criticism for his handling of the coronavirus crisis. It was also a rare achievement for his Mideast team, led by adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose Mideast plan has made little headway since it was unveiled early this year.\n\nIsrael and the UAE are among Trump\u2019s few close international allies, and Thursday\u2019s deal may have been seen as an election gift.\n\nU.S.-Israeli author Joel Rosenberg, who met with the crown prince in 2018 alongside fellow evangelical Christians, said the announcement could influence religious voters who may \u201cstruggle to decide\u201d between Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden.\n\nThursday\u2019s agreement offers \u201ca feel that this is historic\u201d and a change for Trump to \u201chave a series of big moments in the months ahead.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Biden praised Israel for freezing the annexation plan.\n\n\u201cThe United Arab Emirates and Israel have pointed a path toward a more peaceful, stable Middle East,\u201d he said, adding that a Biden presidency \u201cwill seek to build on this progress.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu chalked up a diplomatic victory at a time when his shaky coalition government has been plagued by infighting and faces the possibility of early elections. He also faces a corruption trial over charges stemming from a series of scandals.\n\nBut even his rivals praised the deal.\n\nNetanyahu has seen his popularity plummet as the country grapples with a renewed coronavirus outbreak, mass street protests and skyrocketing unemployment as the result of earlier lockdown measures.\n\nFor the UAE, home to skyscraper-studded Dubai and the rolling, oil-rich sand dunes of Abu Dhabi, it further burnishes its international campaign to be seen as a beacon of tolerance in the Middle East despite being governed by autocratic rulers. It also removes the stigma of recognizing Israel and could open the door for neighboring countries to follow suit.\n\nThe Gulf state of Bahrain welcomed the deal.\n\nAll in all, Netanyahu paid a relatively minor price. Although the hoped-for annexation plan is on hold, a half-century status quo remains in place in which Israel maintains its occupation of the West Bank and continues to expand its scores of settlements while Palestinians live in small autonomous enclaves. Those settlements are now home to some 500,000 Israelis.\n\nThe Palestinians claim all of the West Bank, captured in the 1967 Mideast war, as the heartland of a future state. The Trump Mideast plan envisions granting Israel permanent control over 30% of that territory, while offering the Palestinians limited autonomy in the remainder. After embracing the plan, Netanyahu backed away from moving forward with annexation last month in the face of fierce international opposition and misgivings by White House officials.\n\nThe Palestinians have rejected Trump\u2019s Mideast plan out of hand.\n\nAbbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, convened a meeting of his top leadership Thursday night, and afterward his spokesman Nabil Abu Rdeneh, said the agreement amounted to \u201ctreason.\u201d He added that the UAE must reverse the decision and urged other Arab countries not to follow suit \u201cat the expense of Palestinian rights.\u201d\n\nThe official Palestinian news agency WAFA said the Palestinian ambassador to the UAE was being recalled.\n\nIn Gaza, Hamas called the deal a \u201cstabbing in the back of our people.\u201d\n\nMoving to head off the Palestinian criticism, UAE officials said the deal had prevented the annexation and kept hopes alive for Palestinian statehood.\n\n\u201cThe UAE is using its gravitas and promise of a relationship to unscrew a time bomb that is threatening a two-state solution,\u201d Gargash said.\n\nIsraeli hard-liners accused Netanyahu of missing an opportunity to annex parts of the biblical land of Israel. Naftali Bennett, a pro-settler lawmaker, welcomed the agreement but said it was \u201ctragic that Netanyahu did not seize the moment.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu insisted there was \u201cno change\u201d to his annexation plans. He said Israel would \u201cwait temporarily\u201d at the request of Trump.\n\nStill, Netanyahu may be hedging his bets ahead of a possible change in the White House. Biden has made clear that he would oppose any annexation.\n\nYoel Guzansky, a senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies, said the deal would solidify Netanyahu\u2019s legacy among Israel\u2019s greatest leaders.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s Rabin with Jordan, Begin with Egypt,\u201d he said, referring to the prime ministers who reached Israel\u2019s other peace deals. \u201cNow there\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu. He\u2019s going to be in the history books.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLee reported from Bled, Slovenia, and Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
