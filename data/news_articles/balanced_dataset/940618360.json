Every faculty member and student is also required to wear a face mask. If a COVID-19 case is confirmed on campus, areas heavily used by the individual will be closed off and disinfected, those in contact with the person will be notified as well as the local health department, according to the district's website.\n\nThe district included protocols for each level of learning. For the elementary, all collaborative spaces were eliminated and students are supervised in the lunch line to ensure social distancing. Recess will still happen, but the kids will be required to wear their face masks and wash their hands afterwards, the plan says.\n\nThe school shared Facebook photos of what the plan looked like in action.\n\n\"Masks on, socially distanced, no problem,\" the post reads.\n\nThrall, which has a population of about 953 people, has one active COVID-19 case, 29 recoveries and one death, according to the city website.\n\nMadalyn Mendoza covers news and puro pop culture for MySA.com | mmendoza@mysa.com | @maddyskye", "METADATA": {"format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "ispremium": 0, "dc.date": "2020-08-13T17:13:36Z", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T17:13:36Z", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T19:52:04Z", "opinion": "false"}, "SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "news_keywords": "Tommy Hooker, Madalyn Mendoza, Central Texas, Williamson County, Round Rock, San Antonio, Thrall ISD, Thrall Elementary, Recess, Thrall, COVID, Facebook, MySA.com | mmendoza@mysa.com | @maddyskye", "nlpOrganization": "Thrall ISD, Thrall Elementary", "nlpPerson": "Tommy Hooker, Madalyn Mendoza", "nlpLocation": "Central Texas, Williamson County, Round Rock, San Antonio", "nlpEvent": "Recess", "nlpOther": "Thrall, COVID, Facebook, MySA.com | mmendoza@mysa.com | @maddyskye", "nlpCategories": "%2FJobs+%26+Education%2FEducation%2FPrimary+%26+Secondary+Schooling+%28K-12%29", "sailthru.title": "Central Texas elementary shares look at the start of an 'unusual school year'", "sailthru.date": "2020-08-13 14:52:00 -0500", "sailthru.author": "By Madalyn Mendoza, San Antonio Express-News", "sailthru_uid": 15481778, "sailthru_pubname": "san-antonio-express-news", "sailthru_siteid": 60, "sailthru.tags": "tommy-hooker,madalyn-mendoza,central-texas,williamson-county,round-rock,san-antonio,thrall-isd,thrall-elementary,recess,thrall,covid,facebook,mysa-com-mmendoza-mysa-com-maddyskye,thrall-isd,thrall-elementary,tommy-hooker,madalyn-mendoza,central-texas,williamson-county,round-rock,san-antonio,recess,thrall,covid,facebook,mysa-com-mmendoza-mysa-com-maddyskye,2fjobs-26-education-2feducation-2fprimary-26-secondary-schooling-28k-12-29", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/13/43/52/19806855/3/sailthruImage.jpg", "og": {"title": "Central Texas elementary shares look at the start of an 'unusual school year'", "description": "Months after the 2019-2o2o school year was cut short due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, kids in Williamson County are back on campus, but it looks different than how they left it.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.lmtonline.com/news/local/article/Central-Texas-elementary-shares-look-at-the-start-15481778.php", "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/13/43/52/19806855/3/rawImage.jpg", "site_name": "Laredo Morning Times"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@lmtonline", "creator": "@maddyskye"}, "fb": {"admins": 100006394927810, "app_id": 1743001672604009, "pages": "105702905593,307851324523,12852567813,480760515417232,288240529145,316774245761,984197758297116,7457442370,207033189701,207346283795,222959748728,207042068180,72983690774,339413234035,343689323559,345828366626,234821559861394,335699426867,10150105039485602,338983127562,364516539001,337922332042,115637335153191,372011535931,333376634908,127590790608884,141923885872653,655037391286291,320774811368833,1740489152861748,469700473093040,386754203367,556449374478585,340999853450,350771491032,1120648627959218,342017778245,338463361591,138772706196968,1641688532739111,326312697536,353120110016,343366744658,335009494554,347261603104,350924013892,257724773860,361203926417,367174215398,284154645394,334501182354,350279743224,154340691263654,147848678611852,361381078011,362831597677,10150095255780118"}, "msvalidate.01": "9451CA04ABC9D1D5C6419C73B4C4F7B7"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
