He had a couple of bars he would visit but he didn\u2019t talk much to many people besides his friends.\n\n\u201cHe worked construction and that was it. He would never throw anything out in front of us. If he had a bottle of water with him, he always waited until he got home to throw it out \u2013 so he was very security conscious and very close to the cloth about his activities.\u201d\n\nHe said police don\u2019t believe he was aware he was being watched adding that he believes it was \u201cjust ingrained into him not to do those things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he knew that he might be watched but really it was just the security culture that he may have grown up with,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said Brady was \u201cliving a nice life\u201d in New York.\n\n\u201cHe had a nice apartment, he got married when he was over here, he had a child, he was steadily employed; he seemed like he had a very nice life,\u201d he said.\n\nDetective Walsh was not involved in Brady\u2019s arrest because it was a federal matter; however, he was invited to observe on behalf on the NYPD.\n\n\u201cWhen the murder of a police officer is involved, we take it very seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would help any agency.\n\n\u201cThe Garda\u00ed came over here, they were very professional, they gave us a lot of information and we worked hand in hand with them.\n\n\u201cThere were many individuals besides myself involved in this and it worked out very well.\u201d\n\nBrady is due to be sentenced on October 14th.\n\nGarda\u00ed have warned that their investigation is ongoing as other suspects believed to have been involved in the robbery still need to be brought to justice.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Aaron Brady was living a \u201cvery nice life\u201d in New York before he was extradited back to Irelan...", "author": "Michael Staines", "dfp": 27435881, "publication": "NT", "now-playing-base": "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/storage.publisherplus.ie/media.radiocms.net/now-playing/", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 329929024447985}, "og": {"title": "Aaron Brady was living \"very nice life\" in US before extradition to Ireland | Newstalk", "description": "Aaron Brady was living a \u201cvery nice life\u201d in New York before he was extradited back to Irelan...", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newstalk.com/news/aaron-brady-nice-life-us-1059820", "site_name": "Newstalk", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.resized.co/newstalk/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLnJhZGlvY21zLm5ldFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjBcXFwvMDhcXFwvMTIxMTA2MTFcXFwvOTAyODg3NTQtMS0xMDI0eDcxMS5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NjQ3LFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6MzQwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cubmV3c3RhbGsuY29tXFxcL2ltYWdlc1xcXC9kZWZhdWx0X25vX2ltYWdlLnBuZ1wifSIsImhhc2giOiI1ZGJhZDJlMDA5YWM1MzVhOTA0Y2I2MjM1ZTAxOGViNjg5MDFmZDQ5In0=/90288754-1-1024x711.jpg", "width": 647, "height": 340, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newstalkfm", "url": "https://www.newstalk.com/news/aaron-brady-nice-life-us-1059820", "title": "Aaron Brady was living \"very nice life\" in US before extradition to Ireland | Newstalk", "description": "Aaron Brady was living a \u201cvery nice life\u201d in New York before he was extradited back to Irelan...", "image": "https://img.resized.co/newstalk/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLnJhZGlvY21zLm5ldFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjBcXFwvMDhcXFwvMTIxMTA2MTFcXFwvOTAyODg3NTQtMS0xMDI0eDcxMS5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NjQ3LFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6MzQwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cubmV3c3RhbGsuY29tXFxcL2ltYWdlc1xcXC9kZWZhdWx0X25vX2ltYWdlLnBuZ1wifSIsImhhc2giOiI1ZGJhZDJlMDA5YWM1MzVhOTA0Y2I2MjM1ZTAxOGViNjg5MDFmZDQ5In0=/90288754-1-1024x711.jpg"}, "powered-by": "PublisherPlus (http://www.publisherplus.ie/)", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}}}
