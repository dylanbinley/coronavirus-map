It banned hilsa catching, selling, transporting, hoarding and marketing for 22 days in the month of October.\n\nThe government also slapped 65-day ban on catching hilsa in the Bay of Bengal between May 20 and July 23.\n\nResearcher Wahab said such banning of mother and juvenile hilsa and awareness among the fishermen have increased production and size of hilsa.\n\nDr M Anisur Rahman, senior scientific officer of Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (Riverine Station, Chandpur) said fishermen were unable to catch fish because of the lockdown over corona virus.\n\n\u201cRiver pollution has decreased and different government initiative of hilsa production is also showing positive results,\u201d he said.\n\nRahman, also doing research on hilsa, said in the previous years, 1-2 percent hilsa weighing over one kg was netted by fishermen but this year 6-8 percent hilsa weigh over on kg.\n\n\u201cHilsa weighing over 1.5 to 2 kg is being netted by 1-2 percent this year while it was below 1 percent,\u201d said the Hilsa researcher.\n\nHilsa is the national fish of Bangladesh. It comprises 12 percent of total fish production and contributes more than 1 percent to the gross domestic product.\n\nHilsa production was 2,90,000 tonnes in 2007-08 FY but it has increased to 5, 17,000 tonnes in 2018-19 and production stood at record 5, 33,000 tonnes last year.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Author": "The Daily Sun", "Developed By": "Bumble Bee Online", "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "1 days", "copyright": "\u00a9 Daily Sun 2015 (www.daily-sun.com)", "fb": {"pages": 267469593263369, "app_id": 966242223397117}, "title": "Big hilsas being netted aplenty", "keywords": "Big hilsas being netted aplenty, hilsa,jhatka,WorldFish", "news_keywords": "Big hilsas being netted aplenty, hilsa,jhatka,WorldFish", "description": "Large-size hilsas are being netted aplenty this season thanks to favourable environment created through various government measures to stop catching of hilsa fry (jhatka).
