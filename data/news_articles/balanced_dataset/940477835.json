If the whole of the 55 minutes was played out, the context of what I said would have become clearer.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time to disown what I said. Yes, I was privy to some very sensitive information which all statesmen are entitled to have by virtue of our public roles.\n\n\u201cI know that I should have corroborated some of the information I received, but perhaps some of it was uncorroborated. I was in no position to follow them to the camp to corroborate what was going on.\u201d\n\nMailafia added that \u201cI must never give up on Nigeria, if need be, I will die for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Northern Governors Forum (NGF) has called for an investigation into the claims.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0,minimum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=no", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "description": "Ex-Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Obadiah Mailafia has insisted that a Northern Governor is Boko Haram's leader.
