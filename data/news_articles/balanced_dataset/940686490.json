IGCC is one of five partner organisations coordinating Climate Action 100+, alongside the UN\u2019s Principles for Responsible Investments.\n\nIGCC chief executive Emma Herd weighed in on the mining group\u2019s changes, saying investors will be continuing to engage BHP and monitoring mining industry associations\u2019 efforts, to address any inconsistencies with the Paris Agreement goals.\n\n\u201cAll mining companies should be working to ensure their industry associations are playing a positive role in establishing stable and responsible climate change policy that helps accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions by 2050,\u201d Ms Herd said.\n\nHSBC global asset management global head of corporate governance Thomas O\u2019Malley commented: \u201cClimate lobbying matters to investors.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs industry leaders like BHP mask firm commitments on climate transition, we welcome this effort to ensure that trade associations remain in step with their more forward-thinking members.\u201d\n\nAMP Capital head of sustainable investment Emily Woodland said her company will continue to support BHP in its climate strategy development and implementation.\n\nAMP Capital, HSBC welcome BHP climate lobbying reforms Sarah Simpkins Last Updated: 14 August 2020 Published: 14 August 2020", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1,user-scalable=no,maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "keywords": "amp, hsbc, bhp", "robots": "index, follow", "author": "Sarah Simpkins", "dfp_key": "d8997e808e1afcecfaa4c60b47b90dac", "description": "AMP Capital and HSBC are among a group backing new changes made by mining giant BHP, as a result of investor engagements targeting its lobbying power.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "og": {"title": "AMP Capital, HSBC welcome BHP climate lobbying reforms", "description": "AMP Capital and HSBC are among a group backing new changes made by mining giant BHP, as a result of investor engagements targeting its lobbying power.", "image": "https://www.investordaily.com.au/images/Investor-Daily-Logo.jpg", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.investordaily.com.au/markets/47654-amp-capital-hsbc-welcome-bhp-climate-lobbying-reforms"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T02:25:52+1000", "section": "Markets", "tag": "amp, hsbc, bhp", "author": "Sarah Simpkins"}, "twitter": {"title": "AMP Capital, HSBC welcome BHP climate lobbying reforms", "description": "AMP Capital and HSBC are among a group backing new changes made by mining giant BHP, as a result of investor engagements targeting its lobbying power.", "url": "https://www.investordaily.com.au/markets/47654-amp-capital-hsbc-welcome-bhp-climate-lobbying-reforms", "site": "@InvestorDailyAU", "image": "https://www.investordaily.com.au/images/Investor-Daily-Logo.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "news_keywords": "amp, hsbc, bhp"}}}
