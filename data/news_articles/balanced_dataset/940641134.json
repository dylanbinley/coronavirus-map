(Sergei Gapon / AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBelarus President Alexander Lukashenko, the man dubbed \u201cEurope\u2019s last dictator,\u201d seems to have badly underestimated at least two serious threats to his 26-year rule.\n\nOne is a microscopic contagion, the coronavirus, which has killed hundreds of his compatriots. The other: masses of women, many of them clad in white, linking arms in a show of defiant solidarity in the streets of Minsk, the capital of the former Soviet republic.\n\nThe country, home to 9.5 million people, has been rocked by protests since Lukashenko, its longtime president, was declared by election authorities to be the landslide winner of Sunday\u2019s national election.\n\nWith signs of blatant vote-rigging, human rights groups, the European Union, the United Nations and the Trump administration have all cast doubt on the election's fairness and decried the brutal treatment of peaceful protesters.\n\nThroughout the week, a crackdown by security forces on opposition demonstrators has escalated. Nearly 7,000 people have been detained, the Interior Ministry said Thursday. Viral videos showed shockingly violent beatings of protesters; reports trickled out of horrific jail conditions and torture of detainees.\n\nAdding a new dimension to the unrest, workers at state-run factories \u2014 a key Lukashenko constituency \u2014 were beginning Thursday to lay down their tools and stage strikes. And several well-known news anchors at state-run outlets have quit, unwilling to voice the government line.\n\nOne of the most striking sights to emerge from days of protests has been women forming \u201csolidarity chains,\u201d waving flowers or portraits of detainees, demanding an end to police brutality while passing motorists honked their support.\n\nWomen all across #Belarus are forming human chains of solidarity. In this video I took a moment ago in #Minsk, they are chanting \"We are for peace!\" This is also a powerful protest against police brutality.

The role of women in both the election campaign and the protests, he said, has been \u201cdistinctive and important \u2026 I can\u2019t think of another of these sorts of events in the region with such a strong and significant gender element to it.\u201d\n\nBelarus\u2019 only Nobel literature laureate, Svetlana Alexievich, also added her voice to the protests, condemning violence and saying Lukashenko should step aside.\n\n\u201cLeave before it\u2019s too late, before you have plunged the people into a terrible abyss \u2014 into the abyss of civil war,\u201d the 72-year-old writer said Wednesday in an interview with the Belarus service of Radio Liberty, directing her remarks at the longtime leader. Alexievich was awarded the 2015 literature Nobel for her work chronicling repression and official malfeasance in former Soviet republics.\n\nEuropean Union foreign ministers were to meet Friday to consider imposing sanctions on Belarus. On Thursday, foreign envoys in Minsk laid flowers at the site where a demonstrator died this week. Authorities said he was carrying an explosive device that went off while he was preparing to throw it, a version of events that has been challenged by opposition activists.\n\nSecretary of State Michael R. Pompeo, traveling in the region as the Belarus unrest continued to unfold, reiterated hopes for a \u201cbetter outcome\u201d for the people of Belarus.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that the EU and the United States fully share the same concerns about what has taken place, and what is taking place, in Belarus,\u201d he said Thursday in Slovenia. Pompeo drew criticism for failing to mention Belarus in a speech delivered a day earlier to Czech lawmakers on freedom in \"the heart of Europe.\"\n\nThe EU is treading somewhat carefully, not wanting to drive Lukashenko into a closer embrace with Russia. Although the Belarus president has had some tensions with Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin has made clear he does not want to see the country turn toward the West and seek membership in the EU or deepen partnerships with NATO.\n\nThe Belarus leader has railed angrily against what he calls outside interference, singling out eastern European neighbors Poland and the Czech Republic, along with Britain. He has received warm congratulations on the vote from a few world leaders, mostly authoritarian-minded ones like himself, including Putin and China\u2019s Xi Jinping, who like him see no need for leadership turnover.\n\nAnalysts said opposition to Lukashenko, building for years as Belarus\u2019 economic situation worsened, was crystallized by his dismissive response to the COVID-19 outbreak, which he termed \u201ccoronapsychosis.\u201d\n\nAs the country's caseload has mounted \u2013 Belarus now has some 70,000 reported infections, and nearly 600 deaths, among the highest per capita rates in Europe \u2014 he eschewed shutdown orders and other mitigation measures, urging people to stave off contagion by taking saunas and drinking vodka.\n\nWith the outside world paying more notice as the days passed, the protests were at a tense juncture. Analysts warned that if he feels cornered, Lukashenko could declare a state of emergency, tantamount to martial law \u2013 although that would raise the risk to the president that the military might be unwilling to back him in putting down mass unrest.\n\n\u201cIt might become a milestone moment,\u201d Minsk-based analyst Artyom Shraibman said. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way to reverse the course of changes.\u201d\n\nTimes staff writer Tracy Wilkinson contributed to this report.", "METADATA": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooNews", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "After &quot;Europe&#39;s last dictator&quot; claims election win in Belarus, days of protests put spotlight on women.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4S3Jh8n7y4Mr5XqXHJLfUA--~B/aD01NjA7dz04NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/la_times_articles_853/1abada1fb2973c3ec0719f2d3ff6ab38", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4S3Jh8n7y4Mr5XqXHJLfUA--~B/aD01NjA7dz04NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/la_times_articles_853/1abada1fb2973c3ec0719f2d3ff6ab38"}, "title": "Women move to forefront of protests sweeping Belarus over disputed election results"}, "application-name": "Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=0a5357ca-8b30-3ccb-bd84-3506fbffc834&src=web", "news_keywords": "Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus, Minsk, European Union", "description": "After &quot;Europe&#39;s last dictator&quot; claims election win in Belarus, days of protests put spotlight on women.", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4S3Jh8n7y4Mr5XqXHJLfUA--~B/aD01NjA7dz04NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/la_times_articles_853/1abada1fb2973c3ec0719f2d3ff6ab38", "description": "After &quot;Europe&#39;s last dictator&quot; claims election win in Belarus, days of protests put spotlight on women.", "title": "Women move to forefront of protests sweeping Belarus over disputed election results", "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/women-move-forefront-protests-sweeping-225005576.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 338028696036, "app_id": 458584288257241}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=0a5357ca-8b30-3ccb-bd84-3506fbffc834&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=0a5357ca-8b30-3ccb-bd84-3506fbffc834&src=web", "app_store_id": 304158842}}}}}
