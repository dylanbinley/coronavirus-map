Iran has not directly commented on the incidents but little-known groups believed to be connected to Iran-aligned militias have claimed some attacks.\n\nFriday\u2019s attack took place as Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi prepares to travel to the United States for talks about Iraq\u2019s future strategic relationship with Washington.\n\nIt also comes after Israel and the United Arab Emirates, two regional opponents of Iran, announced they would normalise diplomatic ties, a move that some commentators say provides a fresh challenge to Iran\u2019s power in the Middle East.\n\nIraq, where U.S.-Iran tensions have often spilled over into violence, seeks to avoid being drawn into any regional conflagration.\n\nThe Middle East came close to a full conflict in January after a U.S. drone strike killed the Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi paramilitary chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis at Baghdad airport.\n\nIran-aligned militias have sworn to avenge their deaths.\n\nThe militias see Kadhimi as having firmly sided with the United States since he took office in May, after he ordered an arrest raid against one powerful Iran-aligned group and has indicated he wants to rein in the paramilitaries.", "METADATA": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "middle-east", "DCSext.ChannelList": "middle-east;worldNews;IN-The-Wire;INWire_EL;everythingNews", "description": "Three rockets landed in the vicinity of Baghdad airport near a military base in the complex that houses U.S. forces, the Iraqi military said, after one of the busiest weeks of attacks against U.S. targets in Iraq for months.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "UK,IRAQ,SECURITY,Israel,Syria,Iraq,Iran,Military Conflicts,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Middle East (Energy),Government / Politics,Lebanon,Middle East,International / National Security,United States,Insurgencies", "news_keywords": "UK;IRAQ;SECURITY;Israel;Syria;Iraq;Iran;Military Conflicts;Diplomacy / Foreign Policy;Middle East (Energy);Government / Politics;Lebanon;Middle East;International / National Security;United States;Insurgencies", "REVISION_DATE": "Fri Aug 14 18:59:33 UTC 2020", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2020-08-14T18:59:33+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-iraq-security-idINKCN25A2IM", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Rockets land near Baghdad airport after week of anti-U.S. attacks", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "IN", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "UK,IRAQ,SECURITY,Israel,Syria,Iraq,Iran,Military Conflicts,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Middle East (Energy),Government / Politics,Lebanon,Middle East,International / National Security,United States,Insurgencies", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "UK-IRAQ-SECURITY", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Rockets land near Baghdad airport after week of anti-U.S. attacks", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2020-08-14T18:59:33+0000", "sailthru.title": "Rockets land near Baghdad airport after week of anti-U.S. attacks", "og": {"locale": "en_IN", "site_name": "IN", "title": "Rockets land near Baghdad airport after week of anti-U.S. attacks", "url": "https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-iraq-security-idINKCN25A2IM", "type": "article", "description": "Three rockets landed in the vicinity of Baghdad airport near a military base in the complex that houses U.S. forces, the Iraqi military said, after one of the busiest weeks of attacks against U.S. targets in Iraq for months.", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T18:59:33+0000", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T18:59:33+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "UK,IRAQ,SECURITY,Israel,Syria,Iraq,Iran,Military Conflicts,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Middle East (Energy),Government / Politics,Lebanon,Middle East,International / National Security,United States,Insurgencies"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/india.reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ReutersIndia", "creator": "@ReutersIndia", "card": "summary", "title": "Rockets land near Baghdad airport after week of anti-U.S. attacks", "description": "Three rockets landed in the vicinity of Baghdad airport near a military base in the complex that houses U.S. forces, the Iraqi military said, after one of the busiest weeks of attacks against U.S. targets in Iraq for months.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "in.reuters/world/middleeast/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Home", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
