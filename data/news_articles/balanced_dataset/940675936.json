[Photo/Xinhua]\n\nWASHINGTON - Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) agreed to the full normalization of relations, according to a joint statement of the United States, Israel, and the UAE on Thursday.\n\nUS President Donald Trump presented the joint statement on Twitter, which said \"this historic diplomatic breakthrough will advance peace in the Middle East region and is a testament to the bold diplomacy and vision of the three leaders.\"\n\nThe statement said, \"Israel will suspend declaring sovereignty over areas outlined in the President's Vision for Peace and focus its efforts now on expanding ties with other countries in the Arab and Muslim world.\"\n\nDelegations from Israel and the UAE would meet in the coming weeks to sign bilateral agreements regarding various areas, said the statement.\n\nTrump later told reporters at the White House that Israel and the UAE would have an \"official\" signing ceremony at the White House in the next few weeks.\n\nThe announcement makes the UAE the first Gulf Arab state and only the third Arab nation, after Egypt and Jordan, to establish diplomatic ties with Israel.\n\nYousef Al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the United States, said that the announcement \"immediately stops annexation and the potential of violent escalation. It maintains the viability of a two-state solution as endorsed by the Arab League and international community.\"\n\nA controversial Middle East peace plan unveiled by the Trump administration in January allowed Israel's annexation of areas of the West Bank, which led to strong opposition worldwide.", "METADATA": {"Keywords": "Israel,UAE,Ties", "Description": "JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that Israel and the United Arab Emirates had agreed to normalize relations between the two countries, which previously had no official diplomatic ties.", "og": {"xi": 0, "title": "Israel, UAE agree to normalization of relations: joint statement", "recommend": 0, "url": "https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202008/13/WS5f355c1ba310834817260323.html", "image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202008/14/5f35e425a3108348fce4b7d3.jpeg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ChinaDailyApp", "title": "Israel, UAE agree to normalization of relations: joint statement", "description": "JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that Israel and the United Arab Emirates had agreed to normalize relations between the two countries, which previously had no official diplomatic ties.", "image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202008/14/5f35e425a3108348fce4b7d7.jpeg"}, "shareImg": "//img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202008/14/5f35e425a3108348fce4b7d3.jpeg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/static/common/img/sharelogo2.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "articaltype": "COMPO", "filetype": 1, "publishedtype": 1, "pagetype": 1, "catalogs": "59b8d011a3108c54ed7dfc52", "contentid": "WS5f355c1ba310834817260323", "publishdate": "2020-08-13", "editor": "\u848b\u6210\u9f99", "author": "\u848b\u6210\u9f99", "source": "Xinhua", "webterren_speical": 6, "sourcetype": 6}}}
