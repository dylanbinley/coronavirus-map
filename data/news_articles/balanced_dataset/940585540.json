Azul hired a restructuring firm when the crisis set in and said it was renegotiating its debts out of court to avoid a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\n\nThe airline now says its new agreements cover 98% of the company\u00b4s leasing liabilities and has managed to reduce its rental costs by 77% between April and December of this year.\n\nAzul said it would compensate for these discounts by paying \u201cslightly higher\u201d leasing costs starting in 2023.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}}}
