He said he expected a number of Arab states to follow the UAE example to \"satisfy\" Washington.\n\nIn regard to the August 4 blast in the Beirut port, Nasrallah said that his group would wait for results of a probe into the incident. But if it turns out to be an act of sabotage by Israel, he said, then it would \"pay an equal price.\"\n\nSpeaking in a televised speech, he said the two theories under investigation were that an accident or sabotage caused the explosion of ammonium nitrate stored at a warehouse. Israel has denied any involvement in the Aug. 4 blast that killed 172 people and injured 6,000.\n\nNasrallah also said that Hezbollah was not concerned with the verdict of a UN-backed tribunal over the 2005 assassination of ex-PM Rafik al-Hariri due on August 18.\n\nHe added that if any members of the Iran-backed movement are indicted, Hezbollah would stand by their innocence.\n\nThe court located outside The Hague, Netherlands, was due to give a verdict in the trial of four men on August 7 but it was postponed after the massive blast that rocked Beirut last week", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "fb": {"pages": 82903654348, "app_id": 287530407927859}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#0B7EB5", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/hdc/images/mstile-144x144.png", "referrer": "always", "robots": "noarchive", "isPremiumContent": "false", "article": {"content_tier": "free", "published": "2020-08-14T19:21:00.000Z"}, "og": {"site_name": "Haaretz.com", "title": "Hezbollah chief says UAE-Israel deal was favor to Trump, betrayal of Islam", "description": "***", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/hezbollah-chief-says-uae-israeli-deal-was-favor-to-trump-betrayal-of-islam-1.9073639", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.haarets.co.il/image/fetch/x_65,y_10,w_2066,h_1202,c_crop/q_auto,h_698,w_1200,c_fill,f_auto/fl_lossy.any_format.preserve_transparency.progressive:none/https://www.haaretz.co.il/polopoly_fs/1.9073750!/image/1566863184.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "title": "Hezbollah chief says UAE-Israel deal was favor to Trump, betrayal of Islam - Middle East News", "description": "Nasrallah says in televised speech that Trump announced the deal because he needed 'an achievement' ahead of U.S. elections", "keywords": "Hassan Nasrallah,  Lebanon,  Hezbollah", "ob": {"title": "Hezbollah chief says UAE-Israel deal was favor to Trump, betrayal of Islam"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@haaretzcom", "title": "Hezbollah chief says UAE-Israel deal was favor to Trump, betrayal of Islam", "description": "***", "image": "https://images.haarets.co.il/image/fetch/x_65,y_10,w_2066,h_1202,c_crop/q_auto,h_698,w_1200,c_fill,f_auto/fl_lossy.any_format.preserve_transparency.progressive:none/https://www.haaretz.co.il/polopoly_fs/1.9073750!/image/1566863184.jpg"}, "next-head-count": 22}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
