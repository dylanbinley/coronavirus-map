The 43-metre (140-foot) deep crater at the port could not have been left by the explosion of the amount of ammonium nitrate reported by Lebanese authorities, he said:\n\n\u201cIt would have been shallower, maximum 25 or 30 metres.\u201d\n\nThe main explosion, of the ammonium nitrate warehouse, was preceded by a nearby fire.\n\nHayoun said that having seen footage of that fire he was convinced it was caused by the combustion of fireworks \u2013 and that this would have been sufficient to set off the ammonium nitrate.\n\nIsrael Defense, a leading private online journal with close ties to the Israeli military establishment and which first reported Hayoun\u2019s findings, described his analysis of a possible blast sequence as consistent with munitions detonations.\n\nSuch a sequence could be consistent with \u201cweapons systems that are activated in a chain\u201d and which might have been stored in the port and set off accidentally or deliberately, said Israel Defense.\n\nHowever, it did not provide evidence to suggest sabotage.\n\n(Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Jon Boyle and Frances Kerry)\n\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor", "METADATA": {"description": "Seismological data suggests that six blasts preceded the Beirut port explosion, the last of them a combustion of fireworks that apparently set off a warehouse full of ammonium nitrate, an Israeli analyst said on Thursday.", "keywords": "analyst, beirut blast, beirut port explosion, israel, Seismological data", "og": {"title": "Seismic Data Suggests String of Blasts Preceded Beirut Explosion: Israeli Analyst", "description": "Seismological data suggests that six blasts preceded the Beirut port explosion, the last of them a combustion of fireworks that apparently set off a warehouse full of ammonium nitrate, an Israeli analyst said on Thursday.", "site_name": "News18", "type": "website", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.news18.com/news/world/seismic-data-suggests-string-of-blasts-preceded-beirut-explosion-israeli-analyst-2784843.html", "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-13T173531Z_3_LYNXNPEG7C12Q_RTROPTP_2_LEBANON-SECURITY-BLAST.jpg"}, "twitter": {"title": "Seismic Data Suggests String of Blasts Preceded Beirut Explosion: Israeli Analyst", "description": "Seismological data suggests that six blasts preceded the Beirut port explosion, the last of them a combustion of fireworks that apparently set off a warehouse full of ammonium nitrate, an Israeli analyst said on Thursday.", "site": "@cnnnews18", "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.news18.com/news/world/seismic-data-suggests-string-of-blasts-preceded-beirut-explosion-israeli-analyst-2784843.html", "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-13T173531Z_3_LYNXNPEG7C12Q_RTROPTP_2_LEBANON-SECURITY-BLAST.jpg", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "account_id": 4503599627804328}, "msvalidate.01": "86D6E80EF6FB868FA92FFE8908337B04", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.news18.com/news/world/seismic-data-suggests-string-of-blasts-preceded-beirut-explosion-israeli-analyst-2784843.html?utm_source=ie9&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=pinned-ie9", "fb": {"admins": 503334673, "pages": "31867849201, 187957574620134, 126166140913489, 784667114916040,1075464282525405, 312128074436", "page_id": "31867849201, 187957574620134, 126166140913489, 784667114916040,1075464282525405, 312128074436"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "bitly-verification": "cf8654d2b6b1", "dailymotion-domain-verification": "dm0njrxcv1osfkah2"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
