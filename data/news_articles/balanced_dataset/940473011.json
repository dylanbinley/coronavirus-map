Only an advance team to open one but that is their job as well. I want these people on first available flight out. Meanwhile advance team to house and feed them,\u201d Locsin said in a tweet.\n\nLocsin was responding to a social media post of a Filipino netizen who has been apparently stranded in Morocco since March desperately seeking government\u2019s help for immediate repatriation.\n\n\u201cAsking for help to the embassy in a foreign country which I am stuck since March due to pandemic is equivalent to 0. It\u2019s been 6 months since I\u2019ve been crying for help and asking for advice but they are not capable to offer a helping hand instead, they are good on ignoring us, giving us lame excuses and rude remarks is what they are good at,\u201d the netizen said.\n\nThe netizen was wondering why Morocco\u2019s neighboring countries have managed to arrange repatriation flights for Filipinos wanting to go back home, even as they already expressed willingness to purchase their own air ticket to a neighboring country where there are repatriation flights to the Philippines.\n\nThe netizen claimed the Embassy reportedly told them that repatriation flights are \u201conly for those OFWs who lost their jobs and stranded abroad.\u201d\n\nThe netizen added, \u201cSo what about us\u2026 tourist? Aren\u2019t we Filipinos as well who have limited funds, who have no job/lost our jobs due to pandemic (and) being stuck in a foreign land for a long period of time?\u201d\n\nLast June, interim Philippine Ambassador to Morocco Maria Agnes Cervantes confirmed that they have been receiving repatriation requests from \u201ca small number of Filipinos\u201d displaced from their jobs due to the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe have established our connections with them. We communicate through Viber or Whatsapp where we also send them notes during the lockdown,\u201d Cervantes said during an interview at the Laging Handa briefing, even as she assured the embassy will continue to communicate with members of the Filipino community \u201cto ensure that their concerns are attended to.\u201d\n\nBased on the latest mapping conducted by the temporary Mission in Rabat, there are more than 1,000 Filipinos currently working in Morocco, from highly skilled to household help.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#25387A", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#25387A", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Manila Bulletin The Nation's Leading Newspaper", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Locsin acts on plea of Pinoys stranded in Morocco - Manila Bulletin", "description": "Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. on Thursday directed the Department of Foreign Affairs to look into the plight of Filipino tourists stranded in Morocco following complaints that the temporary Philippine Mission in Rabat has reportedly ignored their appeal for help.", "url": "https://mb.com.ph/2020/08/13/locsin-acts-on-plea-of-pinoys-stranded-in-morocco/", "site_name": "Manila Bulletin", "image": {"identifier": "https://mb.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/locsin-1.jpg", "width": 1350, "height": 900}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/manilabulletin/", "published_time": "2020-08-13T04:35:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T04:37:31+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@manilabulletin", "site": "@manilabulletin"}, "generator": "WooCommerce 4.2.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://mb.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cropped-favicon-270x270.png", "position": 2}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": true, "NOTES": ["Tourism"]}}
