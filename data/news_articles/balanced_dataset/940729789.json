These areas are: the \u00cele de France region, the departments Nord, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Vosges, Sarthe,Ile-et-Vilaine, Gard, Haute-Garonne, la Loire, Haute-Savoie, Alpes-Maritimes and Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne.\n\nDenmark\n\nFrance has been classified as \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018yellow\u2019 by Denmark, meaning that they can enter the country if they have a worthy purpose or have booked a stay of at least six nights and can prove it.\n\nFinland\n\nFinland still has tight border restrictions. Anyone who wishes to travel there must be able to prove their residence in Finland, or have a family link with a local resident, or a professional reason to go there. Quarantine is recommended for anyone arriving in the country, but is not monitored.\n\nGreece\n\nEveryone travelling to Greece must fill out a passenger locator form online at least 48 hours before travelling. Also, a random Covid-19 test may be demanded on arrival in the country, regardless of a person's nationality or the country they have travelled from. A positive test will require the traveller to carry out a two week quarantine as instructed by the Greek health authorities.\n\nIceland\n\nEveryone arriving in Iceland is expected to undertake a 14-day quarantine. Anyone not wishing to do this can choose to have a Covid-19 test on arrival at the airport. For anyone travelling to the country by ferry, the test can be taken upon departure in Denmark. These measures do not apply to children born after January 1 2005.\n\nIreland\n\nAnyone arriving in Ireland from France is expected to carry out a two-week quarantine, limit their movements and avoid social contact as much as possible.
