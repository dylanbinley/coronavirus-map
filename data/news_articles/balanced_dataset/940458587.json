The isolation treatment centre offers a well-furnished en-suite single bedroom, mini office and lounges, and is targeted at corporate community and discerning clientele who desire a private and serene environment during the period of the management of the infection. The laboratory will detect and diagnose COVID-19 within 24 to 48 hours of testing to avoid long waiting for results.\u201d\n\nBesides, the medical centre also provides facility for children, pregnancy care and theatre to operate COVID-19 patient with acute emergencies.\n\nOluwole said, Shell Nigeria and Seplat Petroleum Plc were just two out of the corporate organisations that had subscribed to the Armoured Shield Medical Scheme, which was the most attractive comprehensive care package offered by any private hospital in Lagos for COVID-19 management.\n\nOn his part, the Commissioner for Health, Lagos State, Prof. Akin Abayomi, said the facility scored 100 per cent at the end of the inspection for accreditation, adding that every equipment and other protocols put in place by the hospital management met all requirements set out by the state government.\n\nHe said: \u201cShield Medical Centre will go a long way in complementing the efforts of Lagos and federal governments in winning the war against the ravaging global pandemic.\n\n\u201cLagos State as the epicentre of COVID-19 in Nigeria has demonstrated commendable leadership through the Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, in curbing the spread of the virus. We have provided a working template which other states are now running within the management of the disease.\u201d\n\nHe identified the apathy of most people to testing, stigmatisation of infected and treated persons, refusal to adhere to non-medical protocols such as social distancing, wearing of a facemask in public places and the general cynicism among the populace that COVID-19 is a \u201cbig man disease\u201d, as some of the challenges facing the fight against the pandemic in Nigeria.\n\nThe Reddington Hospital Group has been a pacesetter in providing affordable, world-class healthcare in Nigeria, scoring many firsts in the process.\n\nOnly recently, it became the only independently-owned private hospital in Nigeria to successfully perform a complex open- heart surgery on a 66-year old Nigerian gentleman.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2020/05/c90247e0-reddington-hospital.jpg", "secure_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2020/05/c90247e0-reddington-hospital.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 606}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Reddington Inaugurates Testing Lab, COVID-19 Hospital - THISDAYLIVE", "description": "\u2022To deliver test results within 24 hours By Martins Ifijeh Reddington Hospital Group has become the first private health facility in Nigeria to inaugurate a state-of-the-art Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) laboratory facility for COVID-19 testing and Armoured Shield Hospital for treatment and management of the disease.
