Gavin Newsom and his shifting rules about closing businesses and schools to fight the coronavirus.\n\nUntil last week, things were starting to look up out here, pandemic-wise.\n\nLos Angeles County, where I live, has been the worst hit county in the state, by far, with 5,112 of its 10,813 COVID-19 deaths.\n\nAs in every other state between here and Boston, the already very sick and the very old accounted for most of the deaths. About 75 percent were over age 65 and 4,486 were living in nursing homes.\n\nCalifornia was struggling to come back to life in mid-June when Newsom finally allowed dine-in restaurants, retail stores, bars, religious services and gyms in some counties to re-open under certain state guidelines.\n\nMore recently, deaths per day have been in a slight decline. So have new positive case numbers per day, COVID-19 hospitalizations and ICU admissions.\n\nThose and other hopeful trends weren\u2019t good enough for Newsom, however.\n\nLast week, seizing on a spike in hospitalizations, he and his health experts again effectively shut down most of the state\u2019s economic and social life.\n\nNewsom forced gyms, houses of worship, hair salons, malls and other businesses to lock their doors again. He also outlawed all indoor dining and ordered the closing of bars, zoos and museums.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, he decreed that public and private schools in 32 of the most populous counties must remain closed this fall and kids can only be taught via remote learning.\n\nPreventing schools from reopening \u2014 even private ones \u2014 is Newsom\u2019s most foolish and harmful mistake.\n\nEven Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York knows how important it is for kids to get back in school \u2014 for the kids\u2019 sake, the sake of their parents and the sake of society.\n\nCalifornians are trying hard to survive Newsom and his fickle rule making.\n\nIn my neighborhood I see people getting manicures and pedicures on the sidewalks.\n\nThe other day, when I ate dinner at my favorite local Italian restaurant, my wife Colleen and I sat outside on the sidewalk at a table next to the grill of a car in a parking lot. Very romantic.\n\nInside, the poor owner had put up plastic shields, sanitized everything and spaced out tables to make sure he met the governor\u2019s earlier rules, but he is once again forbidden to serve anyone.\n\nUp in Napa Valley I have a friend who owns wineries and has three wine tasting places. Only one is allowed to be open because it has outdoor tables.\n\nSo far this year, he\u2019s down $8 million.\n\nBusiness people like my friend across America are getting slaughtered by Newsom and power-mad governors like him.\n\nIt didn\u2019t surprise me when I heard an industry spokesman say on TV that 85 percent of the country\u2019s restaurants are going to go bankrupt.\n\nWe need to get some politicians with guts in California and elsewhere.\n\nWe can\u2019t continue to have authoritarian governors shutting down a school system or an entire state every time there\u2019s a spike in new COVID-19 cases.\n\nWe have to start finding ways to live with the coronavirus, not hide from it, because it\u2019s not going away anytime soon.\n\nEven when we get a vaccine we\u2019ll still need to wash our hands and keep social distance and wear a mask.\n\nNow that we\u2019re into the craziness of a presidential campaign, the politics are going to make everything worse.\n\nWe already have Joe Biden and his new sidekick Kamala Harris blaming President Trump for a virus that started in China.\n\nSo far everything Biden says he\u2019d do to fight the virus when he becomes president has already been done by President Trump.\n\nBut on Thursday Biden came out with a brilliant new idea \u2014 a national mandate for wearing masks outside. Apparently, Newsom is advising Joe\u2019s campaign team.\n\nCopyright 2020 Michael Reagan", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "csrf-token": "gPQ7+JuF4lj/3dJ4ThE6Rads7cfeCFCFlf/61bhoBcDTKhlrauHumqMHQP24PBRMWU+m1EVIqAsdsmLu5gzt7w==", "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "title": "California Burns While Newsom Fiddles", "type": "article", "url": "https://patriotpost.us/opinion/72743-california-burns-while-newsom-fiddles-2020-08-14", "image": {"identifier": "https://patriot.imgix.net/675c5b2e2ea5d34ba7919773282c68229902bdd09437a7a56f312fd6a22b8654.jpg?auto=format", "secure_url": "https://patriot.imgix.net/675c5b2e2ea5d34ba7919773282c68229902bdd09437a7a56f312fd6a22b8654.jpg?auto=format"}, "description": "It's the opening of fire season in California.
