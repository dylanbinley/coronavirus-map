Until then, politicians will still play the race card,\u201d he said.\n\nSingapore Institute of International Affairs senior fellow Dr Oh Ei Sun agreed with Jeniri\u2019s assessment that Malaysia is still not ready to discard race-based politics but pointed out that it is alright as long as peace prevails.\n\n\u201cIt is only natural that some would embrace race-inspired politics and others prefer a more multi-racial or \u2018integrationist\u2019 style, but what is important is to ensure that the execution of each style and exchanges among the role players remain peaceful,\u201d he told theSun.\n\nOh said Malaysia could emulate the Canada and Switzerland models of peaceful societal and political discourses despite their multi-cultural and varied regional background.\n\n\u201cThey practise their various traditions peacefully and respect others\u2019 rights to do the same, while proudly proclaiming their common national identity. This could serve as good reference for other multi-racial and multi-regional countries,\u201d he said.\n\nOn whether Malaysia will ever be ready to fully embrace multi-racial parties, Oh said the people would be more willing when they perceive practical benefits to do so.\n\n\u201cThat typically means they find that they could, for example, increase their customer bases or widen job opportunities. So the absolute priority for the country is still the resuscitation of economic development of each style and exchanges among the role players remain peaceful,\u201d he told theSun.\n\nRead this story in theSun\u2019s iPaper:\n\nRace-based politics here to stay for now", "METADATA": {"keywords": "amar shah mohsen", "description": "PETALING JAYA: Appealing as it sounds, the idea of doing away with race-based politics and parties in Malaysia is a long shot.
