On behalf of the theatre community fund we extend a huge thank you to Amazon for the acknowledgement of the value and power of UK theatre and how we as an industry will survive anything when we hold each other up in times of crisis.\u201d\n\nWaller-Bridge is a hugely powerful figure in the film and TV industry whose career began, like countless others, in live performing arts \u2013 one of the sectors hardest hit by the pandemic. Fleabag, her breakthrough, was first performed at the Underbelly at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2013.\n\nThe fund was launched at the end of July with a \u00a31m pledge of donations by its founders and from other star names including Gillian Anderson, James Corden, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Daisy Ridley, Daniel Radcliffe and Meera Syal.\n\nThe Amazon money will help in the fund\u2019s two strands offering grants of up to \u00a33,000. The first is hardship grants to freelancers in immediate need. The second is innovation and creation money to help artists produce work.\n\nThe other donation, of \u00a31m, will go to the film and TV charity, which has so far distributed more than \u00a33.3m in financial support to thousands of workers in the industry. The Amazon money will, it said, \u201ckick-start a second wave of support including a major new grants scheme that will focus on supporting diverse talent as the industry recovers and production resumes\u201d.\n\nThe donations can arguably be traced back to an intervention made by Sam Mendes in June. In the Financial Times he wrote of the irony of Netflix and Amazon Prime \u201cmaking lockdown millions from our finest acting, producing, writing and directing talent, while the very arts culture that nurtured that talent pool is allowed to die\u201d.\n\nHe called on the streaming giants to use \u201ca fraction of their Covid-19 windfall to help those who have been mortally wounded\u201d.\n\nA month later Netflix gave \u00a3500,000 to a theatre freelance aid fund spearheaded by Mendes. That theatre artists fund has raised more than \u00a32m.\n\nJennifer Salke, head of Amazon Studios, said: \u201cThe creative community in Europe has been vital to our success in producing high-quality Amazon original TV series and movies for our global audience, and it is essential for us to help that community through this pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe money was welcomed by the UK government. Caroline Dinenage, culture minister, said: \u201cWe recognise that the last few months have been difficult for many people in the performing arts and screen industries given the impact of Covid-19.\n\n\u201cThis donation from Amazon adds to the unprecedented support from the UK government to help secure these brilliant industries\u2019 future and help them thrive once more.\u201d", "METADATA": {"description": "Amazon Prime Video to give $6m to support arts production community through Covid crisis", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Mark Brown", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/189213e3c821be729bf1691fa9253e6479cafd98/15_0_2085_1252/master/2085.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b5d13ab7a99be1218cbdc63fa7a5fe66", "keywords": "Coronavirus outbreak,Arts funding,Culture,Phoebe Waller-Bridge,Olivia Colman,Sam Mendes,UK news,Stage", "news_keywords": "Coronavirus outbreak,Arts funding,Culture,Phoebe Waller-Bridge,Olivia Colman,Sam Mendes,UK news,Stage", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/13/phoebe-waller-bridge-and-olivia-colman-welcome-amazon-arts-donation", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/189213e3c821be729bf1691fa9253e6479cafd98/15_0_2085_1252/master/2085.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=41fa13eb58087511c66b3a4bb0f78698", "description": "Amazon Prime Video to give $6m to support arts production community through Covid crisis", "type": "article", "title": "Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Olivia Colman welcome Amazon arts donation", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/markbrown", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "World news", "published_time": "2020-08-12T23:01:38.000Z", "tag": "Coronavirus outbreak,Arts funding,Culture,Phoebe Waller-Bridge,Olivia Colman,Sam Mendes,UK news,Stage", "modified_time": "2020-08-12T23:01:38.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2020/aug/13/phoebe-waller-bridge-and-olivia-colman-welcome-amazon-arts-donation?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2020/aug/13/phoebe-waller-bridge-and-olivia-colman-welcome-amazon-arts-donation?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/13/phoebe-waller-bridge-and-olivia-colman-welcome-amazon-arts-donation", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2020/aug/13/phoebe-waller-bridge-and-olivia-colman-welcome-amazon-arts-donation?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/189213e3c821be729bf1691fa9253e6479cafd98/15_0_2085_1252/master/2085.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=e823b20783bce1be1c75edbf18a3a286", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "dnt": "on"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}}}
