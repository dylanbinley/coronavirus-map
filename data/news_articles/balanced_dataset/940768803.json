Sometimes people are critical, but reasonable, but at other times comments can be overwhelmingly hateful. The Duchess of Sussex has faced vile trolling on social media over the last few years, which Prince Harry claimed displayed \u201coutright sexism and racism\u201d.\n\nTrending\n\nShe has even been accused of faking her pregnancy, among other bizarre conspiracies, and been issued threats of violence. Harry has spoken about how social media comments can negatively impact mental health and Meghan admitted it was a \u201cstruggle\u201d. A Buckingham Palace statement last year said they encouraged social media users engaging with their online channels to show \u201ccourtesy, kindness and respect\u201d. The rules listed on the Royal Family website say comments should not be \u201cdefamatory, deceive others, be obscene, offensive, threatening, abusive, hateful, inflammatory or promote sexually explicit material, violence or discrimination\u201d.

A source told The Sun: \u201cIt was pretty vile for a while. \u201cThere are automated tools which can help to police the very inappropriate comments getting through and also manual moderation \u2012 but there are often thousands of comments. \u201cIt only takes a couple of people to stir up a really nasty conversation with people being very aggressive.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry has spoken about how comments on social media can affect people's mental health\n\nPrincess Anne said it is \"more difficult\" for young royals now due to social media\n\nAnne said: \u201cThe pressure that is applied to the younger members of the family is always worse because that\u2019s what the media is interested in, and that\u2019s hard sometimes to deal with. \u201cBut there was no social media in my day, so it probably has made it more difficult.\u201d Over the past few months, Meghan and Harry have supported efforts to hold social media companies to account. They supported a boycott of Facebook in July called Stop Hate For Profit, whereby companies were asked not to advertise on Facebook during that month, depriving the giant of a large amount of income.\n\nThis was a bid to encourage Facebook to start taking responsibility for the hate and fake news that spreads on its site. Then, last week, Harry wrote an opinion article on The Fast Company, in which he claimed there is a \u201ccrisis of health, hate and truth online\u201d. He urged companies to take a stand to make a more compassionate social media space.
