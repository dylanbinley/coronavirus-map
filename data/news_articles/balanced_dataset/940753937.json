Risa Hontiveros (Senate of the Philippines / FILE PHOTO / MANILA BULLETIN)\n\nHontiveros made the call as the COVID-19 cases in the Philippines soared to 153,660 with 6,216 new infections recorded.\n\n\u201cWe need the IATF to convene an emergency meeting and check with public health experts, epidemiologists, and frontliners on their recommendations to immediately slow down the transmission of the virus,\u201d Hontiveros said in a statement.\n\nHontiveros said the government should come up with a comprehensive plan to curb the cases without having to resort to imposing strict lockdowns in order to enable the country\u2019s economy going despite the pandemic.\n\n\u201cHindi pwedeng lockdown lang. Sa mga areas sa bansa na tinitingnan nating hotspot, sikapin nating magkaroon ng libreng pooled testing, lalo na sa mga at-risk at mahihirap na komunidad (we can\u2019t just rely on a lockdown. Let\u2019s try to hold a free pooled testing in areas in the country that are considered hotspots, especially in at-risk and poor communities),\u201d Hontiveros said.\n\nThe senator also renewed her call for the Department of Health (DOH) and the local government units (LGUs) to support the deployment of more contact tracing teams.\n\nIt is also imperative for state health officials to fully implement basic protection and support to frontliners, hospital-based and community-based care.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to accept recommendations from public health experts, doctors and nurses, frontliners, and epidemiologists. Let them steer our COVID-19 response,\u201d she stressed.\n\n\u201cHindi pwedeng balat-sibuyas ang gobyerno sa mga suhestyon ng mga eksperto (the government shouldn\u2019t be onion-skinned when listening to the suggestion given by experts),\u201d the lawmaker pointed out.\n\nAccording to the DOH, Metro Manila still has the most number of new infections with 3,848, followed by Laguna having 302 new cases. Rizal has 242 infections while Cavite and Bulacan has 240 and 178 new cases, respectively.\n\nDOH said there were 1,038 additional recoveries, bringing the total number of patients who recovered to 71,405.
