A new socio-political order is needed.\u201d\n\nKamal posed the question as to how the rights of the oppressed people would be guaranteed given the fact that the last census in Karachi, the economic lifeline of Pakistan, was not carried out fairly and properly.\n\nA statement issued by the PSP quoted him as saying: \u201cWe have no differences with the state of Pakistan. We will remain loyal to it till our last breath, but I ask conscienceless rulers to grant independence to the people from their personal slavery.\n\n\u201cGive us freedom, transfer powers and resources to the lowest level, [and] launch the PFC Award on the pattern of the NFC Award.\u201d\n\nAfter the promulgation of the 18th Constitutional Amendment, instead of the districts becoming autonomous , the chief ministers had become autonomous, he remarked. The people were not begging for their rights, but rather demanding their rights from the rulers, he added.\n\nKamal was of the view that decisions on streets and neighborhoods of a city larger than 72 countries could not be made by sitting in Islamabad, or in a chief minister\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cOur forefathers didn\u2019t create Pakistan for these corrupt and incompetent rulers who are killing our children, young and old. Malnutrition and poverty are the order of the day while access to affordable education, employment and healthcare are almost a distant dream for the common man. Infrastructure is destroyed and the city has turned into a garbage dumping yard.\n\n\u201cWhen Karachi was being ruled over by us, it was the twelfth fastest growing city in the world and today it is one of the four worst livable cities in the globe.\u201d\n\nKamal asked the people from all over the country to support the PSP, vowing to make Karachi the fastest growing city and Pakistan one of the fastest growing countries of the world.\n\n\u201cThe city was dominated by RAW agents, who made us fight each other on ethnic and religious grounds. However, the PSP thwarted their evil designs through its four years\u2019 resilient and peace efforts. People of all sub nationalities are gathered in today\u2019s ceremony,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cToday, Pakistanis are united under the umbrella of one flag. This is our victory and real success. India has started a war with Pakistan by inflicting atrocities on Kashmiris in IOK.\u201d\n\nThe PSP chief said the prime minister should not ask the nation whether to go to war against India or not. If India did not stop its atrocities, he said, \u201cwe are left with no other option but to wage war against India for our Kashmiri mothers and sisters\u201d.\n\nThe event\u2019s participants were holding Pakistani flags in their hands, waving from cars and motorbikes and chanting slogans in favour of Pakistan and Kamal. A large number of people, including women and children, attended.\n\nNational songs were sung at the main camp, and a large number of jubilant youths continued dancing. Earlier, rallies were staged from all neighborhoods of Karachi, which passed through different parts of the city and converged into a massive gathering at Five-Star Chowrangi.\n\nMQM-Pakistan\n\nThe Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) organised an event to mark Independence Day at the party\u2019s temporary headquarters in Bahadurabad and hoisted the national flag.\n\nA delegation comprising convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, federal minister Syed Aminul Haque and senior leader Amir Khan visited the mausoleum of the Father of the Nation Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah to pay homage to the great leader.\n\nSpeaking on various occasions, the MQM-P leaders said Independence Day was a time to pay homage to the founding fathers and those who sacrificed everything for creating Pakistan.\n\nRich tributes were also paid to the national heroes and all those who rendered sacrifices for the independence of Pakistan at a function organised by the All Pakistan Muttahida Student Organisation, the MQM-P\u2019s student body.\n\nReligious parties\n\nWorkers of the Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan, the Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat and Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen held the national and Kashmiri flags during their rallies.\n\nAMPAK\n\nThe America-Pakistan Business Development Forum\u2019s (AMPAK) Independence Day celebrations were held at the forum\u2019s secretariat.
