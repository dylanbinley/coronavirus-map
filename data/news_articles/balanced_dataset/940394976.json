But the August 4 explosion at Beirut\u2019s port, which killed at least 171 people, injured more than 7,000 and left about 300,000 homeless, shook Lebanon to its core, and in more ways than one.\n\nPrime Minister Hassan Diab, a Sunni Muslim close to Hizbullah, announced six days later while under intense public and official pressure that his government was resigning. In his speech, he said he wanted to join the people in holding long-time political forces accountable, saying: \u201cTheir corruption created this tragedy.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the government\u2019s resignation and the demonstrations will usher in a new political era.\n\nOsama Al-Sharif, a veteran Jordanian journalist and political commentator, says the blast, blamed on 2,750 metric tons of ammonium nitrate stored at the port, brought the country \u201cto its knees\u201d and will lead to major political change.\n\n\u201cHizbullah suddenly inherited all the problems and failures that have plagued the Lebanese state since the 1990s,\u201d the Amman-based Sharif told The Media Line.\n\nHizbullah suddenly inherited all the problems and failures that have plagued the Lebanese state since the 1990s\n\nHe notes that the group is in a \u201cvery complicated position,\u201d as shown by Hizbullah leader Hassan Nasrallah\u2019s \u201ctimid\u201d speech last week.\n\n\u201cHe was almost apologetic, trying to deny any responsibility for the blast at the port \u2013 and he didn\u2019t mention Israel once,\u201d Sharif said, referring to Hizbullah\u2019s arch-enemy.\n\nNizar Abdel Kader, a retired Lebanese brigadier general and Lebanon expert, told The Media Line that a political \u201cearthquake\u201d had been triggered by the explosion.\n\n\u201cLebanon before August 4 isn\u2019t the same as Lebanon after,\u201d he said.\n\nLebanon before August 4 isn\u2019t the same as Lebanon after\n\nThe Lebanese are \u201cafflicted\u201d with great pain and bear huge resentment against the ruling elite, he added.\n\nThe demonstrators have been calling for the leaders of the country\u2019s main political parties to step down, screaming \u201cKelon ya\u2019ani kelon,\u201d Arabic for \u201cAll of them means all of them.\u201d\n\nIn Israel, former National Security Council member Orna Mizrahi told The Media Line it was too early to tell if the explosion would be the tipping point for change.\n\n\u201cIt requires profound reforms that the corrupt Lebanese leadership \u2013 and, of course Hizbullah, which is part of this leadership \u2013 isn\u2019t interested in,\u201d said Mizrahi, a senior research fellow at Tel Aviv University\u2019s Institute for National Security Studies.\n\nIt requires profound reforms that the corrupt Lebanese leadership \u2013 and, of course Hizbullah, which is part of this leadership \u2013 isn\u2019t interested in\n\nShe said the guidelines for assistance from the United States and other Western countries could make a difference \u201cif they would formulate a plan for economic recovery and extensive economic assistance along with demands for change in the political system and a reduction in Hizbullah\u2019s influence.\u201d\n\nShe adds, however, that this might be difficult.\n\n\u201cI think they [will] have to do it gradually,\u201d she said of those offering assistance.\n\nSharif agrees, saying Hizbullah is cornered and seems to be \u201crunning out\u201d of options.\n\n\u201cNeither Iran nor Syria nor any other local or regional player can extend a lifeline to Hizbullah at this stage,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHizbullah,\u201d he noted, \u201chas to embrace the fact that France and the United States are setting the table now, both financially and politically.\u201d\n\nThousands of protesters have been demonstrating since last October against an economic crisis rooted in chronic political and financial corruption among the ruling elite. The protests intensified after last week\u2019s explosion, when thousands of angry demonstrators poured into the streets chanting \u201cRevolution! Revolution!\u201d\n\nThe outgoing government was formed in January with the backing of Hizbullah and its allies after the previous government resigned in the face of the protests.\n\n\u201cThere is also criticism of [Hizbullah\u2019s] struggle with Israel,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cIn my opinion, [it] will not choose to enter into confrontation with Israel now, but [will] postpone it.\u201d\n\nLebanon\u2019s sectarian power-sharing arrangements, originally formulated in the 1940s, were last changed under the 1989 Taif Agreement, or National Reconciliation Accord, which ended the country\u2019s 15-year civil war.\n\nIt made \u201cproper political representation\u201d and \u201cmutual coexistence\u201d for the various sects the main goal of post-civil war electoral law, Sharif explained.\n\n\u201cI think the way forward now would be to depart and admit that the sectarian power-sharing way is over,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe people of Lebanon will not accept it anymore. Neither France nor the US will allow it to continue.\u201d\n\nI think the way forward now would be to depart and admit that the sectarian power-sharing way is over\n\nHe notes that Iran\u2019s financial woes have also had major implications for Hizbullah and calls their close ties an \u201cexistential\u201d threat to Lebanon.\n\n\u201c[Hizbullah] has to stop being a state within a state. It has to extract itself from the political power-sharing game, and this, of course, goes for the rest of the former warlords and political elite that has controlled Lebanon,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody has to make compromises.\u201d\n\nIn a major development, the Trump Administration is preparing to impose anti-corruption sanctions against prominent Lebanese politicians and businesspeople in an attempt to weaken Hizbullah, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nSharif says the Shi\u2019ite group now has a choice to make.\n\n\u201cIf Hizbullah chooses wisdom, it will repatriate and redefine itself as a Lebanese party and not as an Iranian party working out of Lebanon, as a foreign agent,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cThis is a big decision for Hizbullah,\u201d he added, \u201cand if it didn\u2019t understand the lessons [of the] geopolitical earthquake that took place last week, I think it will pay a heavy price.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The resignation of Lebanon's government following the blast that devastated Beirut last week has done little to pacify thousands of protesters demanding a total overhaul of the country's sectarian-based political system.
