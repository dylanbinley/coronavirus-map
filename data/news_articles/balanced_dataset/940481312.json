who were able to delete it and prevent it being put up again.\n\nThe capital murder trial took place against a background of intimidation and interference, with witnesses and their families subjected to threats and targeted using social media.\n\nThe Irish Sun can reveal that the Gardai\u2019s National Bureau of Criminal Investigation have launched a probe into close associates of Det Garda Adrian Donohoe\u2019s evil killer.\n\nThey are accused of attempting to contact relatives of key witness Daniel Cahill in Dublin as part of their efforts to persuade Cahill to withdraw his evidence.\n\nThose behind the intimidation plan are believed to be associates of an armed raider from north Dublin.\n\nThe thug is serving a long sentence after his gang threatened to kill a businessman's kids during a terrifying robbery.\n\nAs part of their probe, gardai undertook a number of searches in Coolock last month.\n\nWITNESS DEATH THREATS\n\nMolly Staunton, who told the trial she heard Brady admit he \u201cshot a cop\u201d, received a death threat on Snapchat within hours of completing her testimony.\n\nThroughout the trial, prosecution counsel Brendan Grehan SC raised concerns about the impact of witness interference and intimidation.\n\nIn total five people who had given statements to gardai failed to show up in court or told the prosecution that their original statements were inaccurate.\n\nOne talked of being \u201cpetrified\u201d after coming into information about the shooting.\n\nAnother potential witness, a friend of Aaron Brady\u2019s, originally provided an alibi for him but later retracted it and then did not come to court.\n\nHe lives in Northern Ireland and will be arrested on a bench warrant if he travels south of the border.\n\nAnother man who resided in the North lived with Brady for a period in New York and dated Ms Staunton.\n\nHe was there, along with Ms Staunton, when Brady said he had to carry around the guilt of having \u201cshot a cop in Ireland\u201d.\n\n'REPREHENSIBLE, BEYOND COMPREHENSION'\n\nThis man initially gave gardai accounts of various times when he overheard Brady say incriminating things about the murder of Det Gda Donhoe but when it came to trial he did not come forward.\n\nThere is an outstanding warrant for his arrest as a result.\n\nBesides the leaked video on social media, Brendan Grehan SC for the prosecution told the court the witness, who lives in New York, was the \u201csubject of widespread intimidation both personally and through his family here in Ireland\u201d.\n\nBrady\u2019s senior defence barrister Michael O\u2019Higgins SC said any campaign to stop witnesses giving evidence is \u201creprehensible\u201d.\n\nAfter hearing evidence there was nothing WhatsApp could do to prevent the video being circulated, Mr Justice White said: \u201cIt\u2019s a sobering day for the administration of justice in Ireland.\u201d\n\nAt the time, he couldn\u2019t even make an order telling people not to share the video as he would have to make the order public through the media, which would alert the jury to the existence of the video.\n\nBRADY'S MURDER 'BOAST'\n\nAnother man, who also lives in New York, told gardai he heard Brady \u201cboasting\u201d in a pub he knew what it was like to kill someone.\n\nAccording to his original statement, when Brady realised he was there he took him outside, assaulted him and warned him to keep his mouth shut.\n\nThe man was left with a scar over his eye which was subsequently photographed by cops.\n\nSome months into the trial, a solicitor on behalf of this man contacted Insp Mark Phillips of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and said his client would not return to Ireland to give evidence.\n\nDuring their visits to the US, gardai became aware of numerous people who had heard Brady admit to the murder. Most were unwilling to talk.\n\nMs Staunton told gardai following her appearance in front of the jury she received a video death threat from a known associate of Brady.\n\nVIDEO THREATS\n\nThe man, who was identified by the witness, sent her a Snapchat video in which he used his hand to form the shape of a gun and said, \u201cBang bang, you\u2019re dead\u201d.\n\nThis was followed by a text message saying, \u201cYou silly, silly girl\u201d with ten crying laughing emojis.\n\nShe had previously been in a relationship with this man and he knew where her family lived.\n\nThe court also heard that two members of Brady\u2019s family had contacted trial witnesses through social media.\n\nTIMELINE OF EVENTS JANUARY 25, 2013: Det Garda Adrian Donohoe shot dead during a robbery at Lordship Credit Union in Co Louth \u2014 a raid that lasted just 58 seconds.
