But the tankers \u2014 the Bella, Bering, Pandi and Luna \u2014 never arrived in the South American country and then went missing. Two of the ships later reappeared near Cape Verde, a US official said.\n\nIran\u2019s ambassador to Venezuela, Hojad Soltani, said neither the ships nor their owners were Iranian.\n\n\u201cThis is another lie and act of psychological warfare perpetrated by the US propaganda machine,\u201d Soltani said. \u201cThe terrorist #Trump cannot compensate for his humiliation and defeat by Iran using false propaganda.\u201d\n\nDespite boasting the world\u2019s largest crude reserves, Venezuela does not produce enough refined products and has seen its overall oil output plunge to the lowest in over seven decades amid its economic crisis and fallout from the US sanctions.\n\nGlobal maritime warning\n\nThe Trump administration has been increasing pressure on ship owners to abide by sanctions against Iran, Venezuela and North Korea as it tries to force them change course.\n\nIn May, Washington issued an advisory urging the global maritime industry to be on the lookout for tactics to evade sanctions like dangerous ship-to-ship transfers and the turning off of mandatory tracking devices \u2014 both techniques used in recent oil deliveries to and from both Iran and Venezuela.\n\nVenezuelan state-run oil firm PDVSA has begun offering to ship its own oil, figuring in the costs in crude supply deals to help customers who have faced difficulties hiring vessels to carry the country's oil.\n\nWashington has been trying to weaken socialist President Nicolas Maduro by choking the Opec member's oil exports, depriving the government of its main source of revenue.\n\nMost shipping firms are avoiding Venezuela because of the US sanctions, making it difficult to hire tankers to load crude.\n\nMeanwhile, in a blow to Iran's influence in the Persian Gulf, Israel and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to a deal that will pave the way for full diplomatic relations between the two.\n\nThe US said the deal would lead to greater cooperation on energy, tourism, security, technology and other areas while the two countries move to allow regular direct passenger flights, open embassies and trade ambassadors for the first time.", "METADATA": {"mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "title": "US confiscates refined oil products destined for Venezuela | Upstream Online", "description": "US seizes cargo of four tankers for allegedly transporting Iranian oil products to Venezuela", "og": {"title": "US confiscates refined oil products destined for Venezuela | Upstream Online", "description": "US seizes cargo of four tankers for allegedly transporting Iranian oil products to Venezuela", "url": "https://www.upstreamonline.com/politics/us-confiscates-refined-oil-products-destined-for-venezuela/2-1-857907", "image": "https://images-global.nhst.tech/image/OFJZemtGMWxoeHdWRS9kVUpIQjhkemdsMUFYUHhuRHlzaVBESXhGMU1Rdz0=/nhst/binary/e24378165e090099c08d5ab2b0b34d0c?image_version=720", "type": "article", "site_name": "Upstream Online | Latest oil and gas news"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "US confiscates refined oil products destined for Venezuela | Upstream Online", "description": "US seizes cargo of four tankers for allegedly transporting Iranian oil products to Venezuela", "image": "https://images-global.nhst.tech/image/OFJZemtGMWxoeHdWRS9kVUpIQjhkemdsMUFYUHhuRHlzaVBESXhGMU1Rdz0=/nhst/binary/e24378165e090099c08d5ab2b0b34d0c?image_version=720", "url": "https://www.upstreamonline.com/politics/us-confiscates-refined-oil-products-destined-for-venezuela/2-1-857907", "site": "@UpstreamOnline", "creator": "@UpstreamOnline"}, "referer": "origin"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
