We then have to verify and corroborate these results from different laboratory tests. We are hoping to provide a more concrete update tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nThe elephant deaths have concerned some conservationists, who fear deaths could spiral out of control if a cause cannot be established quickly.\n\nAfrica's overall elephant population is declining due to poaching but Botswana, home to almost a third of the continent's elephants, has seen numbers grow to around 130,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Brian Benza; Editing by Alexander Winning and Alexandra Hudson)", "METADATA": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@yahooNewsUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Preliminary tests to explain the reason for hundreds of mysterious elephant deaths in Botswana point to a naturally occurring toxin as a probable cause, a senior wildlife official told Reuters.
