This should never be misconstrued as victory over the virus.\n\n\u2018\u2019There is still a serious battle to be fought ahead of us as a people and as a country. It is, important, therefore, that we continue to build on our successes and not do anything to detract from them.\u2019\u2019\n\nFighting the pandemic successfully will take a global effort and Nigeria will not be left out whenever and where ever progress is made. However, the health and safety of Nigerians will always remain our priority in the pursuit of a solution.\n\n\u201cIt might interest you to note that of the 14,906 evacuees received during this COVID-19 pandemic, close to 80% are youths for which we are glad that only 684 tested positive to coronavirus of the 13,844 so far tested.\n\n\u2018\u2019In the coming days, we hope to receive more evacuees from different parts of the world. The National Coordinator will elaborate on this.\u201d\n\nInfection of healthcare workers\n\nThe Minister of State, Health, Sen. Olorunnimbe Mamora, lamented the spike in the infection of healthcare workers, saying the ministry had taken steps to halt the trend.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are concerned by the resurgence of infection in healthcare workers. In a bid to sustain the gains we have made in reducing the rate of infection among our health workers, we have embarked on training and retraining of health workers on infection prevention and control.\n\n\u201cIn Abia State, we have concluded the training of 594 Healthcare Workers from private and public health facilities on infection prevention and control. We are currently investigating healthcare associated infection in a health facility in Kaduna State.\n\n\u2018\u2019Lessons learned from this will be used to improve service delivery. I encourage our health workers not to drop their guards as the pandemic is still with us. Use your PPEs appropriately and judiciously. We have ensured that PPEs are available in all our health facilities.\u201d\n\nThe minister of State, Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, said when the PTF evaluates all the necessary data before it, it would inform its decision as to when to fully reopen tertiary institutions and others.\n\nHe reiterated the appeal of some stakeholders for the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, to \u201cgive a moratorium as to strike actions for the next three years so that the Nigerian university system can rebuild itself before they start further agitations.\n\n\u201cWe are working with science and data and when the country is ready to reopen, I do not believe that ASUU will be unreasonable or illogical about resuming.\n\n\u2018\u2019They have over 10,000 professors out of nearly 65,000 lecturers and I am almost confident that they would know as well as we do that the children need to go back to school as long as we are ready.\u2019\u2019\n\nVanguard\n\nKindly Share This Story:", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=1300", "fb": {"pages": 125111084176530, "app_id": 1281965775160257}, "OBKey": "KoeDKhtk63NPK0HQB1Wydg==", "description": "The federal government said, yesterday, it was currently studying the claims of Russia to a vaccine for Coronavirus.", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Covid-19: Nigeria studying Russia's claim of vaccine \u2014FG", "description": "The federal government said, yesterday, it was currently studying the claims of Russia to a vaccine for Coronavirus.", "url": "https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/08/covid-19-nigeria-studying-russias-claim-of-vaccine-fg/", "site_name": "Vanguard News", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/post-COVID-19.png?fit=673%2C400&ssl=1", "width": 673, "height": 400}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/vanguardngr", "published_time": "2020-08-14T06:01:20+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@vanguardngrnews", "site": "@vanguardngrnews"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "google-site-verification": "AjRfeo4BMZn8J99wiq7X1DKIfO_z-Dnma_6csxvuRRg", "alexaVerifyID": "GKUIyYVwwNAjNpxpU_bP3ZbGFeo", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/favicon.png?fit=16%2C16&ssl=1"}}}
