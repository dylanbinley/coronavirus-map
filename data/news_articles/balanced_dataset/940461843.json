That will likely be the case for years to come, Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, Central Command\u2019s leader, said Wednesday during a talk with the U.S. Institute of Peace.\n\n\u201cAt some point, we do want to get smaller there,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\nThough the Iraqi government has made moves toward calling for a withdrawal of U.S. troops, they have not acted on them in any formal way to push out the roughly 5,000 troops still there.\n\nAt the same time, McKenzie said, the coalition-controlled parts of western Syria can continue to physically fend off ISIS with the help of about 400 U.S. troops, according to figures released late last year but there is no clear replacement for a U.S. presence.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no viable military solution to the conflict in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a political settlement can end the violence and address the underlying conditions that fracture the country and allowed ISIS to take hold.\u201d\n\nThe statement is almost verbatim the rhetoric the Defense Department has used when discussing a troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, which began in 2001 and saw a glimpse of a drawdown in 2014. Since then, the Taliban has regained ground and an offshoot of ISIS has established itself, as Taliban, Afghan and U.S. State Department officials have tried their hands at a peace agreement.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Withdrawal from that country would depend heavily on either side\u2019s ability to beat back ISIS on their own, further complicated by their internal power struggle.\n\nThe goal in the near term is to transition from a tactical presence to one that supports local capacity, McKenzie said, so that Iraqi and Syrian forces are able to fend off not only a physical resurgence of ISIS as a caliphate, but any insurgent activity that goes along with it.\n\nAccording to a report released a year ago by the Defense Department, the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development, ISIS had been gaining ground as movement, if not a territory.\n\n\u201cThis quarter, ISIS continued is transition from a territory \u2015 holding force to an insurgency in Syria, and it intensified its insurgency in Iraq,\u201d the report found.\n\nAt the same time, McKenzie said, it\u2019s his belief that ISIS will continue to try to amass territory, and a coalition troop presence will be necessary to keep that from happening.\n\nKey to that effort will be sending home tens of thousands of ISIS fighters and their families, who are either imprisoned or staying in vast internal displacement camps. Al-Hol, the most notorious, houses 65,000 \u2015 mostly women and children \u2015 in squalid conditions, a perfect storm for radicalization among many who still sympathize with the terror group.\n\n\u201cWe do have a fair amount of evidence that some of the individuals in that camp \u2026 are not just family members associated with ISIS proper,\u201d Air Force Maj. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, CENTCOM\u2019s operations director, said during the event, but that some of them are former ISIS fighters, including some women assumed to be wives of fighters.\n\nHere\u2019s the current US plan to build up Syrian proxies, including an oilfield guard force OIR wants to double the size of some proxy forces in Syria and train a 2,200-man local \u201coilfield guard force\u201d in the northeastern part of the country.\n\nAnd the prisons, run by local forces, have had trouble keeping fighters from escaping, so improving conditions is a security priority, he added.\n\n\u201cAnd also, I would argue, from a humanitarian perspective,\u201d he said.\n\nBut with many countries reluctant to repatriate citizens who escaped to join ISIS, the prospect of stateless people reintegrating into peaceful society is grim.\n\n\u201cThe international community needs to support repatriation efforts, or coalition \u2013 D-ISIS \u2013 efforts may be for naught,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cThat\u2019s the best way to solve that particular problem.\u201d\n\nMcKenzie warned that his biggest priority in that arena is preventing the spread of \u201cconnective tissue,\u201d or the decentralized network \u2014 in the vein of al-Qaida \u2015 that could launch attacks around the world.\n\n\u201cThe challenge with that is if we maintain too much of a geographical focus, we forget that the long reach of ISIS ideology globally can reach out and touch folks who were previously radicalized and pill them back in to the ISIS fold,\u201d Grynkewich said.\n\nIdeally, years on, security forces in Iraq, Syria and around the world would be able to tamp down on any ISIS activity, whether it came from remote networks or another effort to gain territory in the Middle East.\n\nThat won\u2019t just be a military effort, he added, and will involve not only diplomacy, but information campaigns to deter anyone thinking of joining up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fire in the minds of men,\u201d McKenzie said of the Islamic State. \u201cIt\u2019s an idea. And so it\u2019s very hard to fight an idea within a boundary.\u201d", "METADATA": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#4f497a", "msapplication-TileImage": "/pb/resources/assets/favicon/mil/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "/pb/resources/assets/favicon/mil/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#4f497a", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Despite defeating the physical ISIS caliphate, Gen.
