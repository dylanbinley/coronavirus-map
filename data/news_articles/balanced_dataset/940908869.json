We are also ready to massively scale up production of these vaccines, as soon as scientists give a green signal.\u201d\n\nThe PM also lauded the efforts of the \u2018Corona warriors\u2019 \u2014 doctors, nurses, healthcare staff, and sanitation workers \u2014 for serving people selflessly for an extended long period of time during the pandemic.\n\nHe also expressed condolence for all the families who lost their loved ones during the pandemic. \u201cI believe that the will power of the 130 crore Indians will make us victorious in the fight against coronavirus,\u201d Modi said.\n\nWhile Modi did not name the three vaccines in his speech, ThePrint brings you details about them, which are in advanced stages of development and trials in India, and who is developing them.\n\nBharat Biotech/ICMR\n\nIndia\u2019s first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin, developed by Hyderabad-based vaccine manufacturer Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has begun human clinical trials.\n\nCovaxin vaccine falls under the category of inactivated vaccines. In such candidates, the pathogen is \u2018deactivated\u2019 so that it can no longer cause infection. However, parts of the virus can still be identified by the body\u2019s immune system and can trigger an immune reaction.\n\nWe are deeply grateful to our readers & viewers for their time, trust and subscriptions.

SUBSCRIBE NOW\n\nOnce the vaccine is administered, the body produces antibodies that can fight off the novel coronavirus infection.\n\nTo develop the vaccine, scientists at Bharat Biotech have used a SARS-CoV-2 strain that was isolated at the National Institute of Virology in Pune.\n\nThe vaccine trial was at caught in a controversy in June when ICMR Director General Dr Balram Bhargava had written to the principal investigators at all 12 trial sites, saying the institute was looking at a 15 August launch date. Bharat Biotech said the trials will be conducted over 15 months.\n\nAlso read: Don\u2019t expect Covaxin news on 15 August, says Bharat Biotech, phase 1 of ICMR trial still on\n\nZydus Cadila\n\nAhmedabad-based pharmaceutical firm Zydus Cadila\u2019s vaccine ZyCoV-D against the novel coronavirus is also undergoing human clinical trials.\n\nThe company said that its vaccine is likely to be launched by next year.\n\nSuch vaccines contain a genetically engineered plasmid \u2014 a small DNA molecule that can replicate independently. The plasmid is engineered to produce a part of the virus that can trigger a protective immunological response.\n\nDNA-based vaccines do not need a SARS-CoV-2 virus strain, unlike the inactivated vaccines that require viruses in killed or inactivated forms. This makes developing the virus much simpler as it can be manufactured under minimal biosafety requirements.\n\nIn the absence of any infectious agent in the vaccine, it can be manufactured with ease, under minimal biosafety requirements (BSL-1).\n\nAlso read: Indian firms Ipca, Zydus Cadila get big US orders for chloroquine to fight COVID-19\n\nSerum Institute of India\n\nPune-Based Serum Institute of India (SERI) has received the DGCI nod to start trials in India for the vaccine developed by Oxford University and Astra-Zeneca.\n\nThe ChAdOx1-S vaccine has already started phase three trials in several parts of the world including the US and Brazil.\n\nSERI trials will end in November.\n\nThe vaccine contains a weakened and non-replicating version of a common cold virus that affects chimpanzees, which has been engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The spike protein of the novel coronavirus allows it to enter human cells. The presence of this protein triggers immune response in a body.\n\nThe company is tying up with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to ramp up vaccine production and make it ready to be supplied to low and middle income countries at a low cost.\n\nAlso read: Serum Institute tells Modi govt how pandemic is affecting clinical trials of non-Covid drugs\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram\n\nNews media is in a crisis & only you can fix it You are reading this because you value good, intelligent and objective journalism.
