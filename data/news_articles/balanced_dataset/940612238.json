She said decisions on where she should be based could be reassessed in the future \"if and when our clients require.\"\n\nMs. Kennedy said she relocated from Sydney, where she was the head of research and governance at ANZ Private Banking & Advice. A spokesman at ANZ Private couldn't immediately provide details on whether she had been replaced in that role.", "METADATA": {"robots": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Pensions & Investments", "url": "https://www.pionline.com/money-management/wasatch-global-names-first-asia-pacific-institutional-head", "title": "Wasatch Global names first Asia-Pacific institutional head", "image": {"identifier": "https://s3-prod.pionline.com/s3fs-public/styles/800x600/public/kennedy_amelia_2020_head-main_i.jpg", "url": "https://s3-prod.pionline.com/s3fs-public/styles/800x600/public/kennedy_amelia_2020_head-main_i.jpg"}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Salt Lake City-based Wasatch Global has named its first head of institutional business development for the Asia-Pacific region.", "title": "Wasatch Global names first Asia-Pacific institutional head", "url": "https://www.pionline.com/money-management/wasatch-global-names-first-asia-pacific-institutional-head", "image": "https://s3-prod.pionline.com/s3fs-public/styles/800x600/public/kennedy_amelia_2020_head-main_i.jpg"}, "description": "Salt Lake City-based Wasatch Global has named its first head of institutional business development for the Asia-Pacific region.", "article": {"section": "MONEY MANAGEMENT", "published_time": "2020-08-13T11:14:35-0400"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "taxonomy_access_control": "Metered", "taxonomy_category": "MONEY MANAGEMENT", "taxonomy_topics": "P&I Daily: People", "published_at": "20200813_15:14:35", "year": 2020, "article_guid": 928016, "url": "https://www.pionline.com/node/928016", "category_name": "MONEY MANAGEMENT", "summary": "Salt Lake City-based Wasatch Global has named its first head of institutional business development for the Asia-Pacific region.", "type": "Article", "title": "Wasatch Global names first Asia-Pacific institutional head", "image": "https://s3-prod.pionline.com/s3fs-public/kennedy_amelia_2020_head-main_i.jpg", "authors": "Douglas Appell"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
