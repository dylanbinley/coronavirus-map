REUTERS/Thierry Gouegnon\n\nFive people have been killed and more than 100 wounded during demonstrations in recent days, official figures showed, as tensions ran high after President Alassane Ouattara announced last week he would run for re-election on Oct. 31.\n\nOpponents say the move violates a constitutional two-term limit and jeopardises the tenuous stability achieved since Ouattara\u2019s first election win in 2010 sparked a brief civil war.\n\nOn Friday, the remnants of tyre barricades smouldered in the opposition stronghold of Bonoua, as residents gathered in the rubble of the town\u2019s police station that was torched by protesters the previous day after one of them was shot dead.\n\nA column of police reinforcements arrived in Bonoua on Thursday night after the crowd clashed with police who used tear gas and live bullets, witnesses said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to march until October. Tomorrow we will keep on marching,\u201d said local youth leader Frederik N\u2019Ta N\u2019Chou, to cheers from the crowd. \u201cWe don\u2019t have weapons but we have stones.\u201d\n\nSecurity Minister Vagondo Diomande said order had been restored across Ivory Coast.\n\n\u201cThe government calls on everyone to exercise restraint,\u201d he said in a statement late on Friday.\n\nOpposition groups insist the president must stand down after serving two terms, in accordance with the law, but Ouattara says the new constitution, adopted in 2016, acted as a reset button, allowing him to run again.\n\nWhile there was far less public unrest on Friday than previous days, a small protest in Yopougon, a district of the commercial capital Abidjan, saw a passenger bus set on fire in the early hours. By midday, traffic was flowing normally under the supervision of a police patrol.", "METADATA": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "worldNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "worldNews;IN-The-Wire;INWire_EL;everythingNews", "description": "Protesters in Ivory Coast set fire to a bus in Abidjan on Friday after deadly protests earlier in the week against the president's decision to seek a third term, and organisers elsewhere vowed further action against his bid to stand again.", "Author": "Ange Aboa", "keywords": "UK,IVORYCOAST,POLITICS,Elections / Voting,Human Rights / Civil Rights,Military Conflicts,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Government / Politics,International / National Security,Africa,Conflicts / War / Peace,Civil Unrest,Presidential Elections", "news_keywords": "UK;IVORYCOAST;POLITICS;Elections / Voting;Human Rights / Civil Rights;Military Conflicts;Diplomacy / Foreign Policy;Government / Politics;International / National Security;Africa;Conflicts / War / Peace;Civil Unrest;Presidential Elections", "REVISION_DATE": "Fri Aug 14 21:14:34 UTC 2020", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2020-08-14T21:14:34+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Ange Aboa", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-ivorycoast-politics-idINKCN25A2MF", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Bus torched in Ivory Coast as election tensions run high", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "IN", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "UK,IVORYCOAST,POLITICS,Elections / Voting,Human Rights / Civil Rights,Military Conflicts,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Government / Politics,International / National Security,Africa,Conflicts / War / Peace,Civil Unrest,Presidential Elections", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "UK-IVORYCOAST-POLITICS", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "Slideshow", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Bus torched in Ivory Coast as election tensions run high", "sailthru.author": "Ange Aboa", "sailthru.date": "2020-08-14T21:14:34+0000", "sailthru.title": "Bus torched in Ivory Coast as election tensions run high", "og": {"locale": "en_IN", "site_name": "IN", "title": "Bus torched in Ivory Coast as election tensions run high", "url": "https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-ivorycoast-politics-idINKCN25A2MF", "type": "article", "description": "Protesters in Ivory Coast set fire to a bus in Abidjan on Friday after deadly protests earlier in the week against the president's decision to seek a third term, and organisers elsewhere vowed further action against his bid to stand again.", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200814&t=2&i=1529687093&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7D1KS", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T21:14:34+0000", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T21:14:34+0000", "section": "World", "author": "Ange Aboa", "tag": "UK,IVORYCOAST,POLITICS,Elections / Voting,Human Rights / Civil Rights,Military Conflicts,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Government / Politics,International / National Security,Africa,Conflicts / War / Peace,Civil Unrest,Presidential Elections"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/india.reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ReutersIndia", "creator": "@ReutersIndia", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Bus torched in Ivory Coast as election tensions run high", "description": "Protesters in Ivory Coast set fire to a bus in Abidjan on Friday after deadly protests earlier in the week against the president's decision to seek a third term, and organisers elsewhere vowed further action against his bid to stand again.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200814&t=2&i=1529687093&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7D1KS", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200814&t=2&i=1529687093&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7D1KS"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "in.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Article - News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "World - World", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "World", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "World", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
