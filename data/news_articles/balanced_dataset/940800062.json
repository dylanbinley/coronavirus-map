Clashes between security forces and protesters quickly erupted in the most sweeping challenges to Lukashenko\u2019s grip on the country.\n\nThe protests have grown increasingly violent, and workers at several state-owned factories and other major enterprises across the country have walked off the job. Tikhanovskaya\u2019s video could provide more momentum to rallies that had endured despite appearing temporarily leaderless.\n\nLukashenko appeared on state television Friday saying: \u201cFor now, I am alive and not abroad.\u201d He quickly pivoted to \u201cdiscuss the construction sector.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen in a message that the regime is refusing to capitulate, the Central Elections Commission announced its final election results: Roughly 80 percent of the vote went to Lukashenko. Tikhanovskaya, a surprise opposition candidate after her activist husband was arrested, received about 10 percent, according to the state count.\n\nEurope weighs response\n\nE.U. foreign ministers agreed to impose sanctions on Belarusan officials involved in the violence. They will draw up a list of targets in the coming days, two diplomats familiar with the discussions said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity while the meeting was ongoing.\n\n\u201cThe authorities are taking their own people hostage,\u201d said Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius, whose country is sheltering Tikhanovskaya after she fled Belarus early Tuesday. \u201cAggression always instigates aggressive resistance. And if people previously were calmed down many times, no one knows how big is the threshold this time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLinkevicius said Tikhanovskaya was pressured by Belarusan authorities into leaving the country after an hours-long meeting at the Central Elections Commission late Monday.\n\nThen the next day, Tikhanovskaya released an emotional video saying she \u201cmade a very difficult decision\u201d and \u201cGod forbid you face such a choice that I had to face.\u201d In a second video, released roughly an hour later that appeared to have been taped inside the Central Elections Commission building, Tikhanovskaya read a prepared statement that asked her supporters to stop protesting and said, \u201cThe people of Belarus have made their choice\u201d in the election.\n\nTikhanovskaya\u2019s supporters believe that statement was coerced. On Friday, she reasserted that independent vote counts indicated much higher support than in the state election figures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn districts where the commissions counted honestly, my support stands at 60 to 70 percent, and even at 90 percent\u201d in one Minsk neighborhood, she said in the video.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always said that our choice should be protected only by legal, nonviolent methods, while the authorities have turned citizens\u2019 peaceful protests into bloodshed,\u201d she added.\n\nLimited leverage\n\nSome European diplomats said they had relatively little leverage to influence the overall outcome of the unrest in the country, which is not an E.U. member.\n\nSanctions, as inevitable as they might be, will simply drive Lukashenko further into the Kremlin\u2019s arms.\n\n\u201cAuthorities will be weaker, and that means Russia will have more chances to pressure,\u201d Linkevicius said. \u201cI assume they will abuse Belarus even more, politically and economically.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn what appeared to be a gesture toward Moscow, Belarus said it had released 32 men it said were Russian mercenaries who were sent to incite riots ahead of the election.\n\nThe group, arrested in late July, was believed to be part of the shadowy Russian paramilitary Wagner outfit, security analysts have said. They added that it was likely the men were using Minsk as a transit hub to Africa \u2014 a common practice that would have been cleared with authorities in Belarus.\n\nBelarus initially announced that 33 men were taken into custody. The reason for the discrepancy in the numbers was not immediately clear.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, during a visit to Europe this week, has not specified any possible U.S. response to the Belarus election and unrest. Washington restored diplomatic relations with Minsk for the first time since 2008 and signed a deal to sell oil to Belarus earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWe were incredibly troubled by the election and deeply disappointed that it wasn\u2019t more free and more fair,\u201d he said in Prague during an interview Thursday with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.\n\nFor now, European diplomats say they are focused on halting the violence and pushing Belarusan authorities to free opposition activists and protesters they have imprisoned in recent weeks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is an almost impossible situation,\u201d said Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics, whose country, along with Lithuania and Poland, has been among the European leaders of the response to Belarus because of their border with the country.\n\nIf Lukashenko clings to power, he said: \u201cPutin can be very happy. Lukashenko is going to be fully in his control, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be for the next two to three years.\u201d\n\n'Harder to suppress'\n\nEuropean diplomats say there is little chance that Belarus is following the path of Ukraine, where pro-European protests toppled a Moscow-allied president in 2014.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Belarus currently, we don\u2019t have any illusions,\u201d Rinkevics said. \u201cIt\u2019s not striving for Europe. It\u2019s very tied to Russia. It\u2019s not like in Ukraine, where you had a clear European path.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nArtyom Shraibman of Sense Analytics, a Minsk-based political consultancy, said the Belarusan decision-makers are so \u201coverwhelmed with the domestic pressure\u201d that \u201cthey have no time to think about sanctions from abroad.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn several videos posted to social media, crowds of striking factory workers are asked to indicate whether they voted for Tikhanovskaya, with the vast majority responding by standing, raising their hand or cheering. In a sign of a few cracks in Lukashenko\u2019s regime, several police officers and one government official have resigned in protest.\n\n\u201cThis is not just a solidarity chain on the streets anymore,\u201d Shraibman said. \u201cNow the country has turned to full strike mode, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s harder to suppress, even if you instill some state of emergency.\u201d", "METADATA": {"description": "The video from Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who fled to Lithuania, came amid E.U. talks on possible steps against Belarus\u2019s authoritarian ruler.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/belarus-protests-opposition-svetlana-tikhanovsky-lukashenko/2020/08/14/c810761a-dd63-11ea-b4f1-25b762cdbbf4_story.html", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AKCLFVG6GEI6VMQF76BY4FNJUY.jpg&w=1440", "title": "From self-exile, Belarus opposition leader calls for protests to reach \u2018every city\u2019", "description": "The video from Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who fled to Lithuania, came amid E.U. talks on possible steps against Belarus\u2019s authoritarian ruler."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "From self-exile, Belarus opposition leader calls for protests to reach \u2018every city\u2019", "description": "The video from Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who fled to Lithuania, came amid E.U. talks on possible steps against Belarus\u2019s authoritarian ruler."}, "last_updated_date": "2020-08-14T21:39:30.521Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "next-head-count": 2}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
