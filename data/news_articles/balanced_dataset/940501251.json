President Jair Bolsonaro participated in the ceremony together with former president Michel Temer, who was invited by the government to lead the mission to the Arab country. Temer and his entourage traveled to Lebanon in an Embraer 190. Representatives of the entities that collected a portion of the donations, including the Arab Brazilian Chamber of Commerce, participated in the ceremony.\n\nThe KC-390 is taking medicines, health equipment, and foodstuffs donated by the Ministry of Health and entities with ties to the Lebanese community, which collected them from their members and Brazilians. The cargo shipped includes products purchased by the Arab Chamber with its own funds as well as funds raised in a campaign together with other associations and people from across Brazil. The campaign is still accepting donations.\n\nAt the ceremony, president Bolsonaro stressed the role of the Lebanese community in the donations. Bolsonaro pointed out that the world is going through a pandemic and that Lebanon was hit by the disaster in the middle of it. An explosion in Beirut last week left 170 dead, 6,000 injured, and thousand homeless. Bolsonaro said that the donation is a symbolic act. \u201cWhat we can offer, largely from our Lebanese community, is from our hearts,\u201d he said.\n\nBolsonaro said that the date marks a stronger relation between Brazil and Lebanon and that the two countries want democracy and freedom. \u201cOur countries do not give up democracy and freedom, it is what we want for the whole world,\u201d he said. The president added that the Lebanese and their descendants greatly contribute to Brazil. \u201cBy working, becoming integrated and collaborating in several areas so that Brazil reaches the prominent place it deserves on the world stage,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Arab Chamber was represented in the ceremony at the Air Base by its president Rubens Hannun, Investment director Daniel Hannun and director Claudia Yazigi Haddad, who is also a director at the Women\u2019s Committee of the Chamber. \u201cThe Arab Chamber is honored to be part of this, as it reiterates our purpose to bring Arabs and Brazilians together wherever they are, including in the social sphere,\u201d Hannun told ANBA.\n\nHannun said that the Arab Chamber was sought out as a channel for donations by entities and individuals in the country, whether they were Lebanese descendants or not. \u201cThis moved the entire Brazil,\u201d Hannun said. Brazil has 12 million of Arabs and descendants, and the largest group is made up by Lebaneses, according to a research recently made public by the Arab Chamber and carried out by H2R Pesquisas Avan\u00e7adas and Ibope Intelig\u00eancia. \u201cI\u2019m very proud to see everyone getting together for a brother country such as Lebanon \u2013 Christians, Muslims, Maronites, all with the same purpose,\u201d Haddad said.\n\nThe entourage travelling to Lebanon is led by Temer and includes senators Nelson Trad Filho and Luiz Pastore, secretary of Strategic Affairs of the Presidency of Brazil Fl\u00e1vio Viana Rocha, and Federation of Industries of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo (FIESP) president Paulo Skaf. The group is slanted to arrive in Lebanon on Thursday (13) and returns on Saturday (15).\n\nSon of Lebanese parents, Temer said he was moved by the invitation to lead the entourage and thanked for the donation in behalf of the Lebanese community. \u201cI\u2019m thanking you in behalf of my parents. They passed away a long time ago, but they certainly are seeing this ceremony from the spiritual plane and applauding what you and the Brazilian government are doing for Lebanon,\u201d he said.\n\nLebanon\u2019s ambassador in Brazil Joseph Sayah also thanked for the donation in behalf of the Lebanese people. He said that Bolsonaro phoned him to extend his sympathy and support. \u201cAs always, I felt at home by the warm response shown by Mr. President and Foreign Relations minister,\u201d he said about Brazilian FM Ernesto Ara\u00fajo. He said that donation does not come as a surprise due to the family and history ties between the two nations.\n\nThe ceremony also featured Air Force commander lieutenant general Antonio Carlos Moretti Bermudez, Commercial Association of S\u00e3o Paulo (ACSP) chairman Alfredo Cotait, and Skaf. \u201cThis donation is taken by our most modern aircrafts, KC-390 Milennium and Embraer-190, manufactured in Brazil, which will take our sympathy across the sea,\u201d commander Bermudez said. Cotait said that many are working to collect donations and stressed the role of the Federation of Muslim Associations in Brazil (FAMBRAS) chairman Mohamed El Zoghbi.\n\n\u201cLife holds surprises for us. Who would say that we would experience a pandemic in 2020, navigating through this year of unknown, in the health, economy and social sphere? Who would say that suddenly a bomb would blow out in the Port of Beirut, causing the death of some many dear people? That\u2019s life. This makes us very sad but also more humble, humane, sympathetic. This flight proves that,\u201d Skaf said.\n\nThe two aircrafts took off from S\u00e3o Paulo bound to Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1, where they will land for a technical interval. Then they go to the Salt Island in Cape Verde, then Valencia, Spain, then Beirut, according to Ag\u00eancia Brasil.\n\nTranslated by Guilherme Miranda\n\nPal\u00e1cio do Planalto\n\nAlan Santos/PR\n\nPress Release\n\nAlan Santos/PR\n\nSd A.
