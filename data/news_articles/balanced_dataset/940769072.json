The average age of those infected is 31 years as some two thirds were infected in the nightclubs and bars that remain open beyond midnight,\u201d Croatia\u2019s chief epidemiologist Krunoslav Capak told a news conference.\n\nSo far Croatia, a country of 4 million people, has recorded 6,258 cases of COVID-19 and 163 deaths.\n\nAustria on Friday warned against travel to Croatia..\n\nEarlier this week Italy introduced mandatory coronavirus testing for everyone who enters Italy from Croatia. Slovenia also said it might tighten restrictions on travellers from Croatia who now need to show a negative coronavirus test to be able to visit Slovenia.\n\nSeveral localised outbreaks in Europe, such as in Italy and Germany, have been traced back to travellers returning from trips to party hot spots in Croatia in the past couple of weeks, notably from the island of Pag.\n\nFrom this weekend Croatia has decided to require that bars and nightclubs close after midnight for a period of 10 days, in an effort to reduce the number of infections.\n\nCroatia had recorded relatively low numbers of COVID-19 cases during the spring lockdown and during the reopening of its economy promoted itself as a safe destination for tourists.\n\nThe country this year expected around a third of the tourists who visit in comparison with previous summer seasons, but the number of tourists in July and August in many places reached even 60% to 70% of last year\u2019s figures. Travellers came from countries like Germany, Austria, Slovenia and Poland.", "METADATA": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "worldNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "worldNews;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;US-The-Wire;USWire_EL", "description": "The number of daily COVID-19 cases peaked in Croatia on Friday as some neighbouring countries tighten measures for travel to Croatia potentially affecting summer tourism which has so far performed better than expected amid the pandemic.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "US,HEALTH,CORONAVIRUS,CROATIA,Germany,South,Eastern Europe,Health / Medicine,Croatia,Italy,European Union,Austria,East European Countries,Europe,Public Health,Poland,Emerging Market Countries,Epidemics,Slovenia", "news_keywords": "US;HEALTH;CORONAVIRUS;CROATIA;Germany;South;Eastern Europe;Health / Medicine;Croatia;Italy;European Union;Austria;East European Countries;Europe;Public Health;Poland;Emerging Market Countries;Epidemics;Slovenia", "REVISION_DATE": "Fri Aug 14 13:24:10 UTC 2020", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2020-08-14T13:24:10+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-croatia-idUSKCN25A1SM", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Croatia pays price in COVID-19 cases for lax approach to nightlife", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,HEALTH,CORONAVIRUS,CROATIA,Germany,South,Eastern Europe,Health / Medicine,Croatia,Italy,European Union,Austria,East European Countries,Europe,Public Health,Poland,Emerging Market Countries,Epidemics,Slovenia", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-CROATIA", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Croatia pays price in COVID-19 cases for lax approach to nightlife", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2020-08-14T13:24:10+0000", "sailthru.title": "Croatia pays price in COVID-19 cases for lax approach to nightlife", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Croatia pays price in COVID-19 cases for lax approach to nightlife", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-croatia-idUSKCN25A1SM", "type": "article", "description": "The number of daily COVID-19 cases peaked in Croatia on Friday as some neighbouring countries tighten measures for travel to Croatia potentially affecting summer tourism which has so far performed better than expected amid the pandemic.", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T13:24:10+0000", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T13:24:10+0000", "section": "World", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "US,HEALTH,CORONAVIRUS,CROATIA,Germany,South,Eastern Europe,Health / Medicine,Croatia,Italy,European Union,Austria,East European Countries,Europe,Public Health,Poland,Emerging Market Countries,Epidemics,Slovenia"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Croatia pays price in COVID-19 cases for lax approach to nightlife", "description": "The number of daily COVID-19 cases peaked in Croatia on Friday as some neighbouring countries tighten measures for travel to Croatia potentially affecting summer tourism which has so far performed better than expected amid the pandemic.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Article - News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "World - World", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "World", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "World", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}}}
