Godwin Obaseki of Edo has urged the electorate in the state to go out and vote massively on the Sept 19, governorship election.\n\nObaseki made the call on Friday in Ukhuse in Owan West Local Government Area, when addressing members of the Party (PDP) at the Ward 6 campaign ground.\n\n\u201cOn the 19th of September, come out and vote massively for PDP and make sure you stay back in your polling units to defend your vote to avoid manipulation.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen when they ask you to go home or even threaten you. If you obey them, they will manipulate the results.\n\n\u201cMy coming to Ukhuse is a home coming, Four years ago I couldn\u2019t get to you people because of bad road, but I made sure I constructed the road for easy transportation.\n\n\u201cNow, you can now move your commodities to the market and other village to sell.\n\n\u201cI need to buy more tractors for mechanised farming because farming now is very important to Nigeria. We want to phase out the old way of farming, we want to make farming more attractive to our youths.\n\n\u201cThe development of Edo is in your hands. Come out with your Permanent Voters Card (PVC) and vote PDP and I will make sure I keep all my promises to you all,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTelegram\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nSkype\n\nPrint\n\nPocket\n\nWhatsApp\n\nMore\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "uw2qPv_daOnUudnLcO6hjVitB8h5oyN0ua07c8ir0ws", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/naija247news.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Godwin-Obaseki-Okay-ng-1.jpg?fit=1140%2C570&ssl=1", "width": 1140, "height": 570}, "type": "article", "title": "Election: Stay to defend your vote, Obaseki tells electorate", "url": "https://naija247news.com/2020/08/14/election-stay-to-defend-your-vote-obaseki-tells-electorate/", "description": "By Monday Ajogun Ukhuse, (Edo) Aug. 14, 2020 Gov.
