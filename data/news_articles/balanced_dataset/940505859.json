So, from the get-go, the EC has disenfranchised one million people for nothing\u201d, he insisted, adding that the voter registration exercise \u201cdidn\u2019t go well as expected\u201d.\n\n\n\nA few days ago, security analyst Col Festus Aboagye (retired) described the timing of the compilation of the 2020 voter register as bad.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe timing of the voter registration was wrong\u201d, he told Prah Jr on Tuesday, 11 August 2020.\n\n\n\nIn his view, the new register should have been compiled after the Professor Ken Attefuah-led National Identification Authority (NIA) had finished with its work so that everybody eligible to have had the Ghana card, got it so they could use the same document for compiling the new voter register. \u201cNo passport\u201d, he said.\n\n\n\nThe Electoral Commission used the Ghana card and passport as the only two breeder documents for the compilation of the new register. Eligible voters without any of the two documents had to rely on the guarantor system, where two Ghanaians had to vouch for their eligibility.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the EC said on Wednesday, 12 August 2020 that a total of 16,932,492 persons have been captured onto the new register by the end of the exercise on Sunday, 9 August 2020. The EC says the overall registration exercise was successful, as it was \u201cinclusive, participatory, orderly and peaceful.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer GhanaWeb is not responsible for the reportage or opinions of contributors published on the website.
