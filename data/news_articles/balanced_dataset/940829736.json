But the funding that Vic has announced is an option for us too,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut as I said, we\u2019re really concerned the pandemic is going to continue, but we\u2019re going to do our part to keep our costs down.\u201d\n\nThe money is being provided to municipalities as part of a $4-billion partnership between the federal and provincial governments. The first phase, announced Wednesday, includes $1.6 billion.\n\nThe city is currently faced with a $1.7-million deficit, of which $1 million is associated with shortfalls in transit.\n\nA majority of council also has supported subsidizing the airport as it deals with its own share of lost revenue and the indefinite suspension of flights by Air Canada.\n\nCurrent projections suggest the airport could receive $525,000 from the city by the end of the year.\n\nCity staff also have been tasked with finding $1.5 million in next year\u2019s budget to support the airport\u2019s continued operation.\n\nMcDonald and others on council, meanwhile, have pointed to the need to support the airport in order to preserve jobs and the economy.\n\n\u201cOur mandate is growth and we will continue to fight to get as much business and industry and population to our community as we can,\u201d he said.\n\nRota said it is unfortunate the city has to bear the brunt financially for what is happening at the airport.\n\nHe said his hope is the federal and provincial funding announced this week would be part of the solution, adding he is in constant contact with the minister of transport, whose office is \u201cwell aware\u201d of what is going on.\n\n\u201cIt is not something that has been resolved yet, but it certainly is something that is important, as you can see, to all of us,\u201d Rota said.\n\nFedeli noted that the mayor, most of council, and the majority of the business community and citizens of North Bay and the region understand the importance of having an active airport.\n\n\u201cYes, we all have our work cut out for us between the feds, the province and the city looking to bring an air carrier back that will bring people from North Bay to Toronto and back. That\u2019s an important part, but that\u2019s not everything,\u201d he said.\n\nAlong with companies such as Bearskin Airlines and Chorus, Fedeli said others rely on the airport as well for cargo and medical reasons.\n\n\u201cI can tell you as a former mayor, we know where the rubber meets the road,\u201d he said. \u201cAnthony was a former city councillor. We know where the rubber meets the road and how you have to face your local citizens.\u201d\n\nBearskin Airlines announced this week that along with resuming scheduled flights between Thunder Bay, Dryden, Fort Frances and Kenora Sept. 14, it also would increase services between Thunder Bay, Sault Ste. Marie and North Bay to two daily flights on weekdays, along with Sunday service.\n\nFlights also will be discounted, with the Thunder Bay-North Bay flight costing $174, taxes and surcharges included, for tickets purchased by Sept. 4 for travel through to Nov. 30.\n\nRelated content\n\n\u2018Today was good news\u2019\n\nYear-end forecasts predict $1.7M city deficit\n\nCity tasked with finding $1.5M for airport", "METADATA": {"robots": "noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "915AE10930FFCE1EFBB9D7838CE66DE7", "description": "North Bay Mayor Al McDonald says the option is open for the city to use recently announced COVID-19 relief funding from the federal and provincial governments for Jack Garland Airport.", "news_keywords": "local news", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "stats-full-init": "0.033", "stats-postmedia_theme_pre_initialize": "0.000", "stats-initialize": "0.031", "stats-postmedia_theme_post_initialize": "0.001", "stats-vip_load_plugins": "0.003", "stats-load_plugins": "0.017", "stats-register_widgets": "0.001", "sailthru.date": "2020-08-14 15:22:17", "sailthru.title": "City\u2019s political leadership backs North Bay airport", "sailthru.description": "North Bay Mayor Al McDonald says the option is open for the city to use recently announced COVID-19 relief funding from the federal and provincial governments for Jack Garland Airport.
