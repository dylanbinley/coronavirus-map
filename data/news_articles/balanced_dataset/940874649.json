That was seen as challenging Saudi Arabia\u2019s leadership of the OIC, and angered an ally that is the biggest source of remittances into Pakistan, and among its largest creditors.\n\n\u201cPakistan is asking you to play the role that Muslim Ummah expects from you,\u201d Qureshi said. \u201cI know the foreign office will get tense from what I said, but Kashmiris are being killed.\u201d\n\nBajwa\u2019s visit is aimed at damage control between the historically close nations. While Saudi Arabia hasn\u2019t responded officially to Qureshi\u2019s comments, local reports say the kingdom is starting to withdraw financial support for Pakistan.\n\nThe Express Tribune reported earlier this month that Pakistan\u2019s fourth-largest trading partner hadn\u2019t yet decided on a request to extend a 2018 facility that expired on July 9 allowing deferred payments on $3.2 billion a year worth of oil. Usually the facility is rolled over before its expiry on the request of the borrower, said Yawar Uz Zaman, head of research at Pearl Securities Ltd.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan\u2019s government also unexpectedly repaid a $1 billion low-cost loan to Saudi Arabia from $3 billion that it had refinanced about six months ago. Khan\u2019s first overseas visit as prime minister was to Saudi Arabia in 2018, and on trips to the kingdom and the United Arab Emirates he had negotiated $5 billion of loans.\n\n\u201cPakistani elites have a bad habit of taking Saudi support for granted given what Saudi has done for Pakistan over the decades,\u201d Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator close to the government, said on Twitter Thursday. \u201cWell the party is over and Pakistan needs to deliver value to this relationship.\u201d\n\nThe last time relations between the two nations took a dive was in 2015, when Pakistan declined to send troops to support Saudi-backed forces in Yemen. But the situation improved after Khan was elected as premier. Shortly after the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Khan visited Riyadh for an investment conference even after speakers including Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stayed away.\n\n\u201cIslamabad can\u2019t afford to upset its staunchest allies\u201d Saudi Arabia and China, said Burzine Waghmar, a member of the Centre for the Study of Pakistan at SOAS University of London. \u201cThese two are the cornerstones of its foreign policy. The relationship is most enduring at every level, not just intelligence and political, but strategic and economic.\u201d\n\nBut despite such close relations, the latest tensions \u201creflect ongoing Pakistani frustration\u201d about not being able to do enough against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s move to revoke seven decades of regional autonomy in Kashmir, said James Dorsey, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.\n\n\u201cGulf states are trying to balance their relationships,\u201d Dorsey said by phone from Singapore. \u201cGulf states have relations with India and major investments going into India. Indians are important Asian buyers of oil. All the more so in the current economic environment and oil shock.\u201d\n\nIndia and Pakistan have fought three major wars since independence, including two over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which is divided between the two and claimed by both. India says Pakistan provides safe haven for terrorist groups, and funds attacks in Kashmir, which Pakistan denies.\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia and Pakistan share a religious connection, the kingdoms\u2019s $33 billion trade with India is about 11 times larger. Asia\u2019s third-largest economy is also one of the world\u2019s biggest buyer of oil: Saudi Aramco is working on a deal to buy a $15 billion stake in India\u2019s Reliance Industries Ltd.\u2019s oil and refining division.\n\nPakistan and Saudi Arabia\u2019s foreign ministries did not respond to requests for a comment. Meanwhile, Pakistan\u2019s information ministry played down the incident.\n\n\u201cSaudi has always stood by Pakistan in difficult times,\u201d Information Minister Shibli Faraz said in a briefing in Islamabad on Aug. 11. \u201cWe are thankful for that.\u201d\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "METADATA": {"civicscience": {"jspoll-hostname": "www138.civicscience.com"}, "application-name": "After Tirade Against Saudis, Pakistan Seeks to Ease Tensions", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "Pakistan", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Pakistan\u2019s military chief Qamar Javed Bajwa will head to Saudi Arabia on Sunday to ease tensions after his country\u2019s top diplomat blasted the kingdom for failing to condemn India\u2019s actions in Muslim-majority Kashmir.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
