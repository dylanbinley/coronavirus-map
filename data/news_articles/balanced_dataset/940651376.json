But they acknowledge the numbers have increased sharply this year.\n\nSince January 1, authorities in northern France have recorded around 350 attempts or crossings involving over 4,000 migrants, compared with 203 attempts and 2,294 migrants for the whole of 2019.\n\nThe Calais mayor on Thursday said the problem was of Britain's own making.\n\n\"If the migrants want to cross (the channel), it is because the British themselves put out the call. They have done so by failing to touch their legislation for 20 years,\" she said.\n\n\"Therefore I appeal to Boris Johnson, saying you urgently need to calm down, and urgently need to change your methods of welcoming and dealing with migrants.\"\n\nBouchart also had a message for Darmanin: \"Do not give in, because the British don't know how to negotiate. It's only by standing firm that you achieve something.\"\n\nJohnson on Monday said illegal migrant crossings of the Channel, which have hit record numbers, were \"very bad and stupid and dangerous.\"", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "calais, major, tells, british, pm, calm, down, about, migrants", "fb": {"app_id": 140842089267946}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times AU", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com.au/calais-major-tells-british-pm-calm-down-about-migrants-1606555", "title": "Calais Major Tells British PM To 'Calm Down' About Migrants", "description": "Calais major tells British PM to 'calm down' about migrants", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.ibtimes.com.au/sites/au.ibtimes.com/files/styles/large/public/2020/08/14/britains-conservative-party-government-has-looked-to-increase.jpg?itok=N-50tGqM", "secure_url": "https://www.ibtimes.com.au/sites/au.ibtimes.com/files/styles/large/public/2020/08/14/britains-conservative-party-government-has-looked-to-increase.jpg?itok=N-50tGqM", "height": 691, "width": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"section": "News", "author": "AFP News", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T07:50:02+10:00", "published_time": "2020-08-14T07:43:30+10:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "ibtimesau", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Calais Major Tells British PM To 'Calm Down' About Migrants", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com.au/calais-major-tells-british-pm-calm-down-about-migrants-1606555", "description": "Calais major tells British PM to 'calm down' about migrants", "image": "https://www.ibtimes.com.au/sites/au.ibtimes.com/files/styles/large/public/2020/08/14/britains-conservative-party-government-has-looked-to-increase.jpg?itok=N-50tGqM"}, "msapplication-config": "https://www.ibtimes.com.au/sites/au.ibtimes.com/themes/au_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "inmobi-site-verification": "f7da70fa6877abeb212e7b2ac3833cd2", "Googlebot-News": "noindex", "author": "AFP News", "keywords": "calais, major, tells, british, pm, calm, down, about, migrants", "description": "Calais major tells British PM to 'calm down' about migrants"}}}
