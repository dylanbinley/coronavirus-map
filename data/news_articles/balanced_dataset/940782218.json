With a $9.5million (\u00a37.2million) mortgage, the pair have secured 5.4 acres of land from a Russian businessman who knocked more than $10million (\u00a37.6million) off the original selling price for them. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expected to continue repaying the UK taxpayers for their renovation works on Frogmore Cottage at \u00a318,000 a month as well.\n\nTrending\n\nThis Windsor residence, which the couple insisted on keeping as their UK base during the Megxit negotiations, cost the public purse \u00a32.4million to renovate back in 2019. Yet, tax expert David Lesperance told Express.co.uk this week that the property does not officially belong to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Mr Lesperance explained that it belongs to the Crown Estate instead \u2014 even though the Queen gave it to the couple as a wedding present. The tax expert said: \u201cHarry thought, \u2018Well I know this is going to look bad, because you or the trust made this amount of money to allow us to [renovate] here'.\u201d He added that it was therefore \u201cprobably a smart thing\u201d for the couple to repay their costs on Frogmore Cottage.\n\nPrince Harry, Meghan Markle and Frogmore Cottage\n\nMeghan and Harry during one of their last royal engagements in March\n\nStill, they were not legally \u201cobligated\u201d to do so as the property is not officially theirs, but, as Mr Lesperance remarked: \u201cThat looks good to their fans.\u201d He then said they could \u201cabsolutely\u201d be evicted from the property as a result. He continued: \u201cAssuming that they don\u2019t have a lease, it would be like a normal landlord-tenant situation.\u201d He also explained, in a White Paper published earlier this year which explored Harry and Meghan's decision to relocate, that \u201cany tax liability for capital gains or property tax are the problem of the landlord not the tenants\u201d.

Royal commentators have been doubting how much time Harry and Meghan will actually spend in Frogmore Cottage, seeing as they have now put down permanent roots in Santa Barbara. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex agreed to spend the majority of their time in North America after the Megxit negotiations, and it is not known when they may next return to the UK. Harry and Meghan are also being financially supported by Prince Charles for their first year outside of the royal fold. He is believed to be paying their extensive security bill so that they could start repaying their renovation costs for Frogmore Cottage.
