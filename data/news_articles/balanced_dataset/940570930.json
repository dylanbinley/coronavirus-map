Both Turkey and Greece lay claim to the area.\n\nCagatay Erciyes, a director general responsible for maritime affairs at Turkey's foreign ministry, told Middle East Eye on Wednesday that the Egyptian-Greek deal remained \u201cnull and void\u201d for Turkey.\n\n\u201cGreece, through this deal, violates our and Libya's continental shelf. Egypt also violates Libya\u2019s continental shelf,\u201d he said.\n\nGreece, in return, has been seeking support from the US and European allies.\n\nWhile most of them wished Athens well, France\u2019s Macron decided to back the Greek military with naval deployments.\n\n\u201cI have decided to temporarily strengthen the French military presence in the Eastern Mediterranean in the coming days, in cooperation with European partners including Greece,\u201d Macron, who also declared Turkey\u2019s seismic work as illegal, said in a series of tweets on Wednesday night.\n\nGreek media reported on Thursday that the Greek and French navies conducted exercises in the region, including the zone that Turkey has declared as a research area through a naval telex, known as Navtex, earlier this week.\n\nErdogan calls for dialogue\n\nIn a televised address on Thursday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Greece of exacerbating tensions by taking some \u201cwrong\u201d steps.\n\nHe said Oruc Reis, which has been sailing between Greece and Cyprus since Monday, would continue its work until the end of August in areas designated for Turkish Petroleum many years ago, despite Greece seeking an emergency summit for the EU to discuss Turkey\u2019s \u201cillegal\u201d drilling activities.\n\nYet he called on all parties involved to follow a diplomatic path, saying that \u201ca resolution is possible\u201d through dialogue and negotiation.\n\n\u201cIf we move along with common sense and reason, we can find a formula that is based on win-win [principle] and [something] that protects everyone\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t chasing an unnecessary adventure or rooting for tension,\u201d Erdogan said.\n\nTurkey's president added that he would speak to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is the mediator between the two countries, and president of the European Council, Charles Michel, later on Thursday to discuss the issue.\n\nErdogan defies Greece and Egypt as Turkey resumes Mediterranean drilling Read More \u00bb\n\nWhile there's no confirmed time yet for the proposed talks, Ankara has been manoeuvring diplomatically to fortify itself against possible sanctions.\n\nOn Thursday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu had phone calls with his counterparts from several EU member states, including Bulgaria, Hungary and Italy.\n\nThe main point of disagreement between Athens and Ankara stems from the islands belonging to Greece in the Aegean Sea and Mediterranean. While Turkey says Greece has a right to declare an exclusive economic zone in the region, it insists Athens should take into consideration Turkish interests.\n\nFor example, Athens treats the Greek island of Kastellorizo as a mainland area, and is therefore seeking maritime rights around it. However, the island is just 2km from Turkey\u2019s Antalya, while the Greek mainland is more than 500km away.", "METADATA": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "French support for Athens comes days after Ankara sent a research vessel, accompanied by warships, to disputed waters", "title": "France deploys navy to eastern Mediterranean amid Greece-Turkey standoff", "creator": "@middleeasteye", "url": "http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/france-turkey-greece-eastern-mediterranean-navy-deployed"}, "og": {"site_name": "Middle East Eye", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/france-turkey-greece-eastern-mediterranean-navy-deployed", "title": "France deploys navy to eastern Mediterranean amid Greece-Turkey standoff", "description": "French support for Athens comes days after Ankara sent a research vessel, accompanied by warships, to disputed waters", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/images-story/2020-08-11T142736Z_1192255514_RC2QBI9QCMZN_RTRMADP_3_TURKEY-GREECE.JPG", "url": "http://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/images-story/2020-08-11T142736Z_1192255514_RC2QBI9QCMZN_RTRMADP_3_TURKEY-GREECE.JPG"}}, "description": "French support for Athens comes days after Ankara sent a research vessel, accompanied by warships, to disputed waters", "fb": {"app_id": 882711278504931}, "generator": "Drupal 8 (http://drupal.org)", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/middleeasteye/"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
