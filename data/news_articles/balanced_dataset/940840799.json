demand urgent help from Rishi Sunak", "TEXT": "Travel companies are facing \"three winters\", an MP warned on Friday as 220 businesses wrote to the Chancellor to urge him to save the industry.\n\nIn a letter seen by The Telegraph, the firms called on Rishi Sunak to save \"hundreds of thousands\" of jobs after France, the second most popular holiday destination for Britons, was struck off the UK's \"travel corridor\" list after a surge in coronavirus cases.\n\nThe group of businesses, under the umbrella Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO), said a \"total lack of understanding of the travel industry\" by the Government and a \"complete lack\" of consultation had created a \"ghastly perfect storm\" for the sector.\n\nThe holiday firms are asking the Chancellor for a six-month extension to the furlough scheme for the travel industry as a \"minimum\" requirement.\n\nThey are also calling for the Treasury to provide an \"incentive\" for bond debtors to provide companies with funds in order for them to be able to provide the \"financial protection required by law to enable us to continue in business\".", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1,
