No, her parrot did not escape again but someone was plotting against her. The Bravo star went on Instagram Live to reveal that Gizelle Bryant is the one behind a vicious rumor that brings into question the paternity of her youngest son.\n\nGizelle Bryant and Monique Samuels | Larry French/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images\n\nWhat is this rumor about?\n\nOn the new season of RHOP, Samuels confirms she is estranged from Charrisse Jordan after meeting on the show and forging a strong friendship. The entrepreneur blames Jordan for helping a vicious rumor get around perpetuated by another former friend.\n\n\u201cCharrisse has been facilitating nasty rumors about me and my family. Why would I wanna be around that?\u201d Samuels said during her RHOP confessional.\n\nAlthough Samuels did not want to talk about what the rumor was about, Bryant said that it had to do with an alleged affair the former had with her personal trainer.\n\nJordan clapped back on Twitter saying, \u201cI am so happy that [Monique Samuels] is no longer crying about her bird running away and has gone on Live to talk about me. You\u2019ll fool some but the truth always prevails.\u201d\n\nI am so happy that @iammrssamuels is no longer crying about her bird running away and has gone on Live to talk about me.

During the broadcast, she revealed that there was an alleged meeting with some of the RHOP stars to try to take down Samuels. Karen Huger told the latter that Bryant was planning on revealing that her youngest son was not her husband\u2019s.\n\n\u201cGizelle is planning to go to [the] reunion to tell people Chase isn\u2019t Chris\u2019s and that you were cheating on him and that\u2019s not his baby,\u201d Samuels said that Huger revealed.\n\nRELATED: \u2018RHOP\u2019: Wendy Osefo Shuts Down Karen Huger in Epic Tweet, Fans Can\u2019t Get Enough\n\n\u201cHow disgusting is it? You can say whatever you want about me, but to talk about my child?\u201d Samuels added. \u201cIf someone were to talk about anyone of Gizelle\u2019s daughters or even the illegitimates from her ex, she would go berserk. To bring up my child\u2019s name, when you know the mess ain\u2019t true, how low and disgusting is that.\u201d\n\nWas Ashley Darby involved?\n\nSamuels was told by Huger that Robyn Dixon was also at the meeting, but she doesn\u2019t know how involved she was in this plan to spread the vicious rumor. Many fans called out Ashley Darby, but Samuels defended her saying she has been a friend throughout this ordeal.\n\n\u201cAshley, once we made up, told me about everything that was going on,\u201d Samuels explained. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t at the dinner and she did not want to play any part in what was going on. Every time that a camera was in her face and she was expected to start speaking on these nasty rumors, Ashley and Michael shut the crap down.\u201d\n\nSamuels assured fans that the Darby\u2019s said they would not talk about her family matters on camera and shut down the conversation.\n\n\u201cEvery time she shut it down she then called me and gave me a heads up as to what was going on,\u201d Samuels continued. \u201cAshley has been more of a friend to me than Candiace on a rainy day.\u201d\n\nThe Real Housewives of Potomac airs Sunday nights at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/rhop-monique-samuels-drops-gizelle-bryant-bombshell-vicious-rumor-paternity.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "Monique Samuels from 'RHOP' revealed that Gizelle Bryant was planning on putting into question the paternity of her youngest child.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'RHOP': Monique Samuels Drops Gizelle Bryant Bombshell, Says She's Behind Vicious Rumor", "description": "Monique Samuels from 'RHOP' revealed that Gizelle Bryant was planning on putting into question the paternity of her youngest child.", "url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/rhop-monique-samuels-drops-gizelle-bryant-bombshell-vicious-rumor-paternity.html/", "site_name": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet", "updated_time": "2020-08-13T08:31:49-04:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gizellebryant-moniquesamuels-rhop-bravo-1024x683.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gizellebryant-moniquesamuels-rhop-bravo-1024x683.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ShowbizCheatsheet", "tag": "The Real Housewives of Potomac", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2020-08-13T08:32:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T08:31:49-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Monique Samuels from 'RHOP' revealed that Gizelle Bryant was planning on putting into question the paternity of her youngest child.", "title": "'RHOP': Monique Samuels Drops Gizelle Bryant Bombshell, Says She's Behind Vicious Rumor", "site": "@cheatsheet", "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gizellebryant-moniquesamuels-rhop-bravo-1024x683.jpg", "creator": "@cheatsheet"}, "fb": {"admins": 826582091}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "position": 2}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
