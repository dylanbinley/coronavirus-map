Earlier this week, Misri met Liu Jianchao, deputy director of the office of the CPC Central Committee Foreign Affairs Commission, an influential official in the party. The idea behind these meetings is to let the Chinese know how important the border resolution is for India, and how a prolonged standoff could completely crater the bilateral relationship.Questioned, MEA spokesperson said \u201csome progress (on disengagement) had earlier been made\u201d, highlighting the current impasse.\u201cWhile we would like the ongoing disengagement process to be completed at the earliest, it is important to bear in mind that achieving this requires agreed actions by both sides. We, therefore, expect that the Chinese side to sincerely work with us towards the objective of complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas,\u201d he said.Another round of military commanders\u2019 talks will be held next week, which will be followed by another meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination (WMCC).The Chinese embassy bulletin adds, \u201cThe adventurism of the Indian Army seriously violated agreements on border issues between the two countries and severely violated basic norms governing international relations.\u201dThe only thing Indians and Chinese agree on is that the Galwan clashes broke the agreement of June 6 between the military commanders, though both sides have blamed the other. Indian officials say that while the Indian troops were surprised in the clash, Chinese troops came armed with reinforced sticks with nails and stones wrapped in barbed wire.The MEA spokesperson stressed the importance of \u201ccomplete disengagement along the India-China border areas.\u201d This, he said, was \u201cin accordance with the agreement of the Special Representatives of India and China that early and complete disengagement of the troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and de-escalation from India-China border areas in accordance with bilateral agreement and protocols and full restoration of peace and tranquillity was essential for the smooth overall development of bilateral relations.\u201dThe MEA spokesperson said the \u201cre-deployment of troops to their regular posts \u201ccan be done only through mutually agreed reciprocal actions.\u201d This is a reference to the fact that India has refused to de-escalate until Chinese troops completely disengage in Pangong Tso and Gogra-Hot Springs areas.Reiterating the foreign minister\u2019s comments to an interview in TOI, the spokesperson quoted him as saying, \u201cthe state of the border and the future of our ties, cannot be separated\u201d.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "India News:  The India-China standoff in Ladakh entered its 100th day this week, and, with the disengagement having stalled, India\u2019s envoy to China, Vikram Misri,", "keywords": "India, India news, India news today, Today news, Google news, Breaking news,Vikram Misri,LAC clash,international law,Indian Army,India-China standoff,Beijing", "robots": "NOODP", "og": {"title": "LAC stand-off: We expect China to sincerely work with us to achieve complete disengagement, MEA says | India News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lac-stand-off-we-expect-china-to-sincerely-work-with-us-to-achieve-complete-disengagement-mea-says/articleshow/77550588.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77550826,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-282565,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "India News:  The India-China standoff in Ladakh entered its 100th day this week, and, with the disengagement having stalled, India\u2019s envoy to China, Vikram Misri,", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lac-stand-off-we-expect-china-to-sincerely-work-with-us-to-achieve-complete-disengagement-mea-says/articleshow/77550588.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77550826,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-282565,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "LAC stand-off: We expect China to sincerely work with us to achieve complete disengagement, MEA says | India News - Times of India", "description": "India News:  The India-China standoff in Ladakh entered its 100th day this week, and, with the disengagement having stalled, India\u2019s envoy to China, Vikram Misri,", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "news_keywords": "Google news, Breaking News, India,Vikram Misri,LAC clash,international law,Indian Army,India-China standoff,Beijing", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lac-stand-off-we-expect-china-to-sincerely-work-with-us-to-achieve-complete-disengagement-mea-says/articleshow/77550588.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 26781952138, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
