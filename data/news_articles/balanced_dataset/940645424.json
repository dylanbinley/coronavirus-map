It will keep working towards a resolution within Asean, which is holding discussions with China for a code of conduct for the area, he added.\n\nBLOOMBERG", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "Straits Times", "app_store_id": 547465441, "url": "straitstimes://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/kl-rejects-beijings-claims-in-s-china-sea"}, "web": {"url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/kl-rejects-beijings-claims-in-s-china-sea"}}, "description": "The rebuke is an unusual move for Malaysia, which had previously avoided reproaching China openly by reiterating its focus on ensuring the area remains open for trade..
