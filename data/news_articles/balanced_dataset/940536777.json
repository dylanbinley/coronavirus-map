It\u2019s not fair to everyone, it just isn\u2019t,\u201d the premier told reporters Thursday during a campaign-style tour of Windsor.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re hurting the community and from what I\u2019ve heard \u2026 it\u2019s backfiring on you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a great practice. I love those docs, they do a great job, but, guys, you just can\u2019t overload the ... hospital system. We\u2019re already backlogged on so many areas, on surgeries.\u201d\n\nFord said he is willing to meet with the optometrists to resolve the dispute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to sit down and talk rather than clog up all our hospitals across the province,\u201d he said.\n\nThe optometrists, who began the protest in June, maintain they lose money when treating patients covered by OHIP \u2014 those under 20 and over 65 or who have specific medical conditions.\n\nThey are paid $44 on average per visit, which they say actually costs them $80 or $90.\n\nDr. Sheldon Salaba, the optometrists\u2019 association president, said it was a \u201cdifficult decision\u201d to launch the job action.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a desperate situation. We can\u2019t afford to see these patients in this environment because of this funding inequality,\u201d said Salaba.\n\n\u201cI understand that it\u2019s inconvenient for people ... but we didn\u2019t create this problem,\u201d he said.\n\nPatients who have been turned away from their optometrists and sent to hospitals are frustrated their care was caught up in a funding dispute.\n\nKate Boose, from the Waterloo Region, woke up on July 6 with blurriness in her left eye. She chalked it up to allergies. But when it hadn\u2019t gone away after a day, she called her optometrist\u2019s office \u2014 only to be redirected to a hospital in Kitchener.\n\nBoose wasn\u2019t the only one sent to the emergency department for eye exams.\n\n\u201cI was the fifth eye patient they had seen that day. They said it was a really high number for a regular day,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand that the optometrists feel like they\u2019re underfunded\u2026but in the midst of a pandemic, I don\u2019t feel like this is a wise decision.\u201d\n\nEllen Eppert sympathizes with patients who feel like they\u2019re chess pieces in a spat between the province and its optometrists, but says the \u201ctemporary\u201d inconvenience is worth it if it means optometrists are fairly compensated.\n\nGet more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

He encouraged her to see a doctor and get tested.\n\nShe credits him with discovering an arachnoid cyst that was pushing on her brain. In June, she had surgery to drain the cyst.\n\n\u201cThis guy saved my life because of his training and his skills,\u201d Eppert said. \u201cFor the health of people in Ontario, it\u2019s important optometry is funded properly so they can get the best possible service.\u201d\n\nRead more about:", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicon-wellandtribune-144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicon-wellandtribune-70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicon-wellandtribune-150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicon-wellandtribune-310.png", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=379481068", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "wellandtribune.com", "application-name": "wellandtribune.com", "fb": {"pages": 134392236659479}, "storyuuid": "200d4c9a-7fa3-443a-bfba-a30edeed95e2", "description": "In the wake of revelations by the Star, Ford warns job action by optometrists will backfire.", "keywords": "KMI1,coronavirus,COVID-19,Doug Ford,Windsor,Ontario government,smg_provincial,smg2_politics,algolock", "news_keywords": "KMI1,coronavirus,COVID-19,Doug Ford,Windsor,Ontario government,smg_provincial,smg2_politics,algolock", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wellandtribune", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/Jesse-McLean-229815360543508/", "published_time": "2020-08-13", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T21:10:15.972Z", "section": "Provincial Politics"}, "og": {"title": "Premier Doug Ford blasts optometrists for protest that costs health-care system $250,000 a day", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.wellandtribune.ca/ts/politics/provincial/2020/08/13/premier-doug-ford-in-windsor-on-covid-19-recovery-tour.html", "description": "In the wake of revelations by the Star, Ford warns job action by optometrists will backfire.", "site_name": "wellandtribune.com", "image": "https://images.thestar.com/NxXY3Nfxjy6NskE6YEKCp_a_ZfA=/1200x800/smart/filters:cb(1597353014250)/https://www.wellandtribune.ca/content/dam/thestar/politics/provincial/2020/08/13/premier-doug-ford-in-windsor-on-covid-19-recovery-tour/ford.jpg", "images": "http://dispatcher.thestar.com/assets/img/wellandtribune-ribbon.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "wellandtribune.com", "site": "@WellandTribune", "title": "Premier Doug Ford blasts optometrists for protest that costs health-care system $250,000 a day", "description": "In the wake of revelations by the Star, Ford warns job action by optometrists will backfire.", "image": "https://images.thestar.com/NxXY3Nfxjy6NskE6YEKCp_a_ZfA=/1200x800/smart/filters:cb(1597353014250)/https://www.wellandtribune.ca/content/dam/thestar/politics/provincial/2020/08/13/premier-doug-ford-in-windsor-on-covid-19-recovery-tour/ford.jpg", "creator": "Robert Benzie,Jesse McLean"}, "parsely-title": "Premier Doug Ford blasts optometrists for protest that costs health-care system $250,000 a day", "parsely-link": "https://www.wellandtribune.ca/ts/politics/provincial/2020/08/13/premier-doug-ford-in-windsor-on-covid-19-recovery-tour.html", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-author": "Jesse McLean", "parsely-image-url": "https://images.thestar.com/yXAman5xk-BL0zU8QQx4-crmUhk=/93x62/smart/filters:cb(1597353014250)/https://www.wellandtribune.ca/content/dam/thestar/politics/provincial/2020/08/13/premier-doug-ford-in-windsor-on-covid-19-recovery-tour/ford.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-08-13T12:08:00.000Z", "parsely-section": "Provincial Politics", "parsely-tags": "KMI1, coronavirus, COVID-19, Doug Ford, Windsor, Ontario government, smg_provincial, smg2_politics, algolock, word count: 701-1200 words, source: in-house", "parsely-metadata": "{\"storyuuid\": \"200d4c9a-7fa3-443a-bfba-a30edeed95e2\"}"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
