The commission also said it could purchase an additional 200 million vaccine doses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson, through its Belgian subsidiary Janssen, \u201cwill now enter into contract negotiations with the European Commission,\u201d J&J said in a statement, confirming the volumes indicated by the Commission.\n\n\u201cIf regulatory approval for the company\u2019s vaccine is received, the Commission would be expected to facilitate a process for allocation of the vaccine doses among the member states,\u201d Johnson & Johnson said.\n\nJ&J could produce up to 1 billion doses of its vaccine by the end of 2021, a company executive told Reuters on Tuesday. Its vaccine is likely to be administered in a single shot, the executive said.\n\nReuters exclusively reported in June that the U.S. company was in advanced talks with the EU for the supply of its COVID-19 vaccine under development.\n\n\u201cOur citizens\u2019 lives and our economy need a safe and effective vaccine against the coronavirus. Today\u2019s talks bring us closer to achieving this,\u201d the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement.\n\nThe move follows similar announcements in July about the conclusion of preliminary talks between the EU and Sanofi SA for the purchase of 300 million doses of its potential COVID-19 vaccine that it is developing together with GlaxoSmithKline Plc.\n\nThe EU is using about 2 billion euros (.4 billion) from an emergency fund to strike advance purchase deals with several vaccine makers in a bid to have enough shots for its population of 450 million.\n\nIt is also in talks with Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and CureVac to buy upfront their potential COVID-19 vaccines, EU officials told Reuters in July./reuters.com", "METADATA": {"title": "EU to Buy 200 Million Doses of the Potential COVID-19 Vaccine From Johnson & Johnson - Novinite.com - Sofia News Agency", "Author": "M3 Web - http://m3web.bg", "og": {"url": "https://www.novinite.com/articles/205692/EU+to+Buy+200+Million+Doses+of+the+Potential+COVID-19+Vaccine+From+Johnson+%26+Johnson", "title": "EU to Buy 200 Million Doses of the Potential COVID-19 Vaccine From Johnson & Johnson - Novinite.com - Sofia News Agency", "type": "article", "description": "The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Johnson & Johnson to buy 200 million doses of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, the EU executive and the U.S.", "image": "https://www.novinite.com/media/images/2020-08/photo_verybig_205692.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": "720047876,812913521"}, "verify-v1": "6qlQdLBGNcWbF4R1DGIpYKKygyc4NG/xLxBZYsNmZ38="}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": true, "NOTES": []}}
