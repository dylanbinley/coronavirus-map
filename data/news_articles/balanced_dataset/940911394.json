That must be a joke. It must be ridiculous. Nothing can go so,\u201d he said.\n\nNoel Mignott, head of the PM Group, a tourism marketing agency to the Caribbean, said that the proposal sends a confusing message to the Caribbean tourism industry.\n\nNEEDS CLARIFICATION\n\nHe said that it is confusing and needs clarification by the State Department.\n\n\u201cAt a time when many Caribbean countries are putting safety measures in place to ensure a good winter season as a safe destination, for the president to now say what he is saying would have a disastrous effect on the tourism industry,\u201d said Mignott.\n\nHe questioned whether the president could stop a citizen from returning home.\n\nThe Global Diaspora Council member for the Northeast Region, Dr Kafrren Dunkley, said that such a move by the Trump administration would have a detrimental effect on Jamaica\u2019s already struggling tourism industry.\n\n\u201cThis proposal could dissuade Jamaicans who live in the United States from visiting and contributing to the local economy. If this proposal is approved, Jamaica must use this challenge as an opportunity to reduce reliance on tourism and grow other sectors of the economy, such as agriculture,\u201d she said.\n\nPointing to the fact that the majority of tourists to Jamaica come from the United States, Dunkley said that during the coronavirus period, potential visitors would no longer be willing to travel to Jamaica or the Caribbean if the proposal became a reality.\n\nHead of the Caribbean Immigration Services and community activist, Irwine Clare, described the proposal as \u201canother distraction\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis, too, will be shot down by the courts as being unconstitutional. Americans becoming stateless?\u201d he remarked.\n\nClare said that more and more, the United States is becoming a laughing stock, although conceding that such a move would be quite serious.\n\nHe questioned whether border agents would now be making medical decisions.\n\nAlso criticising the proposal is Congresswoman Yvette Clarke.\n\n\u201cNot only does this suggestion go against the basic, most fundamental principle of citizenship \u2013 the right to return home \u2013 but it will also do little to nothing to stop a pandemic that has already spread beyond his control. We must do everything in our power to fight back against such proposals,\u201d she said.\n\nClarke said that rather than taking the steps necessary to ensure that hotspots have the necessary resources to crush the curve, the president had slowed down the process in an attempt to improve his poll numbers.\n\nShe said that the proposal is nothing more than another splashy order to show that he is doing something.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=3, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Verley Fraizer will be travelling to Jamaica this weekend for an extended stay.
