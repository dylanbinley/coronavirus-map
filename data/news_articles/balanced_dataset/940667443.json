Now that\u2019s all but literal.\n\nHe has blatantly used government resources for some time to help his re-election bid \u2014 as reflected in his 2019 shakedown of Ukraine\u2019s leaders, telling them they would only get $391 million in military aid if they \u201cinvestigated\u201d Joe Biden and his family, and his Saturday promise to give billions of dollars in benefits to the unemployed and tax cuts to the employed without congressional authorization.\n\nNow Trump\u2019s crusade against mail ballots (which he uses himself) and his repeated (discredited) claims they are vulnerable to \u201ctremendous\u201d fraud are leading him down a path no American president has ever taken. On Thursday, in an interview with Fox Business News, he openly said that in order to reduce the U.S. Postal Service\u2019s ability to efficiently process mailed-in ballots, he would oppose any pandemic relief measure from Congress that included new funding for the service. Democrats \u201cneed that money in order to have the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t get [more funding], that means you can\u2019t have universal mail-in voting because they\u2019re not equipped to have it.\u201d\n\nAs is true of so many of Trump\u2019s statements, this is false. Mail voting is neither universal nor uniform. Only eight states will mail all voters ballots this fall, up just two from the 2016 election. And unlike California, 32 states don\u2019t count postmarked ballots that arrive after Election Day. While some concerns about \u201charvesting\u201d \u2014 the collection of absentee ballots by third parties \u2014 are legitimate, there is no evidence of significant fraud in mail voting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMail voting is popular because it works. In 2018, 31 million Americans voted by mail, about a quarter of all voters. After Trump blamed voting fraud for denying him a 2016 popular vote victory over Hillary Clinton, he set up a commission to research his allegations. It disbanded in 2018 after finding nothing to substantiate Trump\u2019s claims. Furthermore, requiring in-person voting during a pandemic is dangerous. Of course it\u2019s smart to promote voting by mail.\n\nTrump counters with more mail voting, \u201cyou\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again.\u201d Once again, his claim is baseless. That\u2019s why in Florida and North Carolina, with no acknowledgment of his double-talking, Trump this month has actually encouraged mail or absentee voting. He knows he badly needs both swing states to get re-elected. Trump\u2019s personal preference for voting by mail only further makes the case for his hypocrisy.\n\nBut the threat he poses to the fall election goes beyond the Postal Service funding fight. The agency\u2019s new leader\u2014 Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a wealthy Trump donor with no Postal Service experience \u2014 has imposed several management changes in recent weeks that have slowed delivery of mail, ostensibly on the grounds of the need for efficiency.\n\nThe Postal Service has problems, but Trump\u2019s shameful sabotage is only making matters worse.", "METADATA": {"og": {"title": "Editorial: Trump\u2019s appalling assault on mail voting builds off false claims", "url": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/editorials/story/2020-08-13/trump-mail-voting-false-claims-fraud", "image": {"identifier": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f7373d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1092x573+0+74/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0d%2F55%2F4f89543e44949622abbbcf568503%2Fbreenmailbox.JPG", "url": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f7373d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1092x573+0+74/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0d%2F55%2F4f89543e44949622abbbcf568503%2Fbreenmailbox.JPG", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/jpeg", "alt": "steve breen mailbox cartoon"}, "description": "No, absentee voting is not riddled with fraud, and, no, mail-only elections are not close to universal", "site_name": "San Diego Union-Tribune", "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-u-t-editorial-board-staff.html", "content_tier": "free", "published_time": "2020-08-14T00:28:10.641", "section": "Editorials"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "No, absentee voting is not riddled with fraud, and, no, mail-only elections are not close to universal", "image": {"identifier": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/579f377/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1092x614+0+53/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0d%2F55%2F4f89543e44949622abbbcf568503%2Fbreenmailbox.JPG", "alt": "steve breen mailbox cartoon"}, "site": "@sdut", "title": "Editorial: Trump\u2019s appalling assault on mail voting builds off false claims"}, "fb": {"app_id": 125832154430708}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "No, absentee voting is not riddled with fraud, and, no, mail-only elections are not close to universal", "brightspot.contentId": "00000173-ea4f-dc70-a7ff-eadf95540001", "brightspot.cached": "false"}}}
