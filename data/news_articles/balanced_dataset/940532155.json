Police have detained around 6,000 people.\n\nWith any EU decision on sanctions requiring unanimity of all the 27 member states, Hungary was the main sceptic, according to the sources. Hungary on Thursday called on the bloc \u201cto pursue dialogue with Belarus and avoid ostracising it\u201d.\n\nSuggesting it could agree to some restrictions, however, Budapest passed up the opportunity to block a statement earlier this week on behalf of all EU countries that specifically mentioned sanctions \u201cagainst those responsible for the observed violence, unjustified arrests, and falsification of election results\u201d as an option.\n\n\u201cThe direction of travel seems clear. How many people would be blacklisted, how deep we go will largely depend on Hungary,\u201d said one EU diplomat in Brussels.\n\nNo final decision was expected on Friday, but the response could be finalised within days after another discussion among EU foreign ministers due in Berlin on Aug. 27-28, the sources said.\n\nGermany\u2019s Heiko Maas said earlier this week the EU might need to reinstate some of the sanctions it had previously placed on Belarus over its human rights record, before lifting them partially in 2016 after Lukashenko released political prisoners.\n\nOn Thursday, Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics joined the growing chorus of those calling for \u201cindividual sanctions against Belarusian officials responsible for crackdown of protests and election fraud\u201d.\n\nLukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for more than a quarter of a century, denies electoral fraud and has accused the protesters of being in cahoots with foreign backers from Russia and elsewhere to topple his government.\n\nNARROW SANCTIONS\n\nAs was the case with EU sanctions on Russia and the people held responsible for Moscow\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea and the turmoil in east Ukraine, the sources said sanctions on Belarus would come in the form of travel bans and the freezing of assets held in the bloc.\n\n\u201cThere has been no signal that any EU country wants to block some restrictive measures because the violence is blatant,\u201d said an EU official close to the matter.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to assess is the level of pressure that would be useful versus what would be counterproductive and risk pushing Lukashenko into Russia\u2019s arms if he sees this as his only possibility to stay in power.\u201d\n\nIn the narrower option, only some officials at the Belarusian election body or security forces who oversaw clashes with protesters could be sanctioned. In a broader version, curbs could also be placed on government officials such as the interior minister, the sources said.\n\nAs the EU weighs its options, one of the bloc\u2019s leading Russia hawks, Poland, called for support to protesters, including possible mediation between them and Lukashenko, rather than a much tougher line.\n\nWarsaw is wary of a repeat of the 2013/2014 street protests in Kyiv, which the EU and the United States supported and Russia then used as an excuse to annex Crimea from Ukraine before backing separatists in the industrial east of the country.\n\nThat suggests a narrower set of sanctions may be more likely for the time being, the sources said, also pointing to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s visit to Minsk in June when he called for the remaining EU sanctions on Belarus to go.\n\nFor the time being, EU restrictive measures on Belarus include an arms embargo as well as a ban on exporting equipment that can be used for internal repression.\n\n(Reporting and writing by Gabriela Baczynska, additional reporting by Marton Dunai in Budapest and Gederts Gelzis in Riga; Editing by Alex Richardson)", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "baheKNA2RfCj_KzL8_7nXIYnwDgvId9hm8sA0G_QHaY", "theme-color": "#16a2ea", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "EU eyes sanctions over disputed Belarus election 'as soon as end-August' - Metro US", "description": "<div class=\"at-above-post addthis_tool\" data-url=\"https://www.metro.us/eu-eyes-sanctions-over/\"></div>BRUSSELS (Reuters) \u2013 The European Union will likely impose new sanctions on Belarus as soon as later this month, diplomats and officials said, after President Alexander Lukashenko cracked down on protests triggered by a disputed election.
