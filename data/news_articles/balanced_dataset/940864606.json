Kim Frum \u2014 a spokeswoman for USPS based at headquarters \u2014 could not say if the freeze would go into effect across the country and would not comment on the freeze in the Western region.\n\nOfficials say that in the last week the USPS has removed letter collection boxes in at least four states: New York, Oregon, Montana and Indiana. The USPS has also begun notifying postal workers in at least three states \u2014 West Virginia, Florida and Missouri \u2014 that they will start to reduce their retail operating hours, according to union officials.\n\nRELATED: Exclusive: Postal service inspector general reviewing DeJoy\u2019s policy changes and potential ethics conflicts\n\nPresumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden called the removal of letter collection boxes \u201cbizarre\u201d during an online fundraiser Friday.\n\n\u201cI was joking earlier with a couple on the call. I wonder if you\u2019re outside trying to hold down your mailboxes. They\u2019re going around literally with tractor-trailers picking up mailboxes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou oughta go online and check out what they\u2019re doing in Oregon. I mean, it\u2019s bizarre!\u201d\n\nAnd Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, called the removal of the letter collection boxes \u201cvoter suppression\u201d on Twitter. Blaiming President Donald Trump, Wyden said the President is sabotaging the election \u201cright under our noses.\u201d\n\nBut Frum suggested the removal, and installation, of the almost 142,000 letter collection boxes nationwide was routine, and \u201chas been based on mail volume received in those boxes.\u201d\n\nFrum said that the postal service has been putting more emphasis on stabilizing the number in use and moving \u201clow-use boxes to high traffic areas.\u201d The US Postal Service blames the coronavirus pandemic, along with its business model, for the need to cut costs.\n\nFrum did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s questions about the reduced hours in West Virginia, Florida and Missouri.\n\nThe USPS has received intense scrutiny in recent weeks as many Americans are expected to vote by mail this presidential election due to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite assuring the public earlier this month that it would be able to handle the added volume of mail-in ballots, the postal service sent letters to multiple states warning them that slowdowns in delivery could cause ballots to show up late and not be counted.\n\nTrump has frequently attacked the postal service, and Louis DeJoy, the newly installed postmaster general, has made sweeping changes to the public service, such as rolling back overtime, leading to service slowdowns. Union officials have consistently warned that new cost-cutting measures put into effect by DeJoy and USPS leadership could have a negative effect on the service\u2019s ability to deliver election-related mail on time.\n\nUnion officials have said their workers are committed to making sure the mail-in vote is handled quickly and appropriately. However, these new protocols are just the latest changes USPS has enacted that have some voters uneasy and appear to be further eroding confidence in their mail system.\n\nUSPS closing some posts offices for lunch, ending extended evening hours\n\nIn the St. Louis area, some post offices that had been open until 6:30 p.m. \u2014 specifically to serve people getting off-work \u2014 would start to close at 5:00 p.m, according to Rebecca Livingston, American Postal Workers Union president of the St. Louis Gateway chapter.\n\nUnion officials in West Virginia, Florida and Missouri also said workers are being told that post offices must close an hour for lunch.\n\nLunch \u201cis historically their busier times,\u201d Sinikka Melvin, the president of the Clarksburg, West Virginia, local American Postal Worker Union, told CNN.\n\nPeople often come in during their own lunch hour to send mail or purchase USPS retail products like stamps, according to Melvin. USPS reducing the retail hours worries union officials, who believe it could create long lines at clerk windows during the election season.\n\nCompounding the problem, those lines could be lengthened by the reductions in the letter collection boxes in neighborhoods and outside post offices, Melvin and other union officials told CNN.\n\nSenators want answers about USPS letter collection boxes\n\nLetter collection boxes have been removed in at least four states, leading some top politicians to ask the agency for answers.\n\nIn New York, Jonathan Smith, president of the local American Postal Workers Union, said the blue boxes that were removed have been taken to a post office in the Bronx. Photos obtained by CNN show a number of the USPS\u2019 blue mailboxes lined up in a storage area, with some behind chains. It\u2019s unclear if all of these mailboxes had been recently removed.\n\nWhen originally contacted by CNN about removal of 45 letter collection boxes in Montana, a USPS spokesperson would not confirm the removal, saying, \u201cHistorically, mail boxes have been removed for lack of use and installed in growth areas. \u2026 It is a fluid process and figures can vary from day-to-day.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, asked DeJoy for answers.\n\nTester said Montanans had told his office that USPS collections boxes \u201cmay have been removed from Bozeman and Lewistown and that there may be plans to remove boxes from Billings.\u201d\n\nIn his letter to DeJoy, Tester asked for the head of the USPS to confirm the removal of collection boxes, the rationale for the move and what has been communicated to the public on the matter.\n\nOregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, promised to make sure ballots are delivered on time.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe Trump is making it harder to send mail & vote in November,\u201d Merkley said on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight like hell to make sure postal workers & letter carriers can deliver every ballot!\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out to the other senators in New York, Montana, West Virginia, Florida, Missouri and Indiana for comment.\n\nThis story and its headline have been updated with additional developments.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "USPS will stop removing letter collection boxes in Western states until after the election, spokesman says - ABC17NEWS", "description": "The US Postal Service will stop taking letter collection boxes off streets in Western states following accusations the removals would further limit some voters ability to send back mail-in ballots.
