I was shocked that everything happened so quickly. I figured they would have moved a little slower so people could take pictures but that wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d one man lamented.\n\nAnother man added, \u201cThat went long too fast man. I don\u2019t know if they were behind time or what but that went past here so quickly.\u201d\n\nA female, who declined to give her name but said she was a supporter of the Democratic Labour Party, said Arthur\u2019s contribution was undeniable.\n\nShe said even though he was not a member of \u201cher party\u201d she felt she had to be there.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day he made a sterling contribution to Barbados and for that all Barbadians ought to be grateful, whether you are a Bee or a Dee.\u201d\n\nTaxi-driver Michael Birkett, who plies his trade from the taxi stand on Upper Broad Street, took the opportunity to pay his final respects.\n\nHe said although he had never met Arthur, he was a man who had done much for Barbados.\n\n\u201cI just stop to take a little peep and to pay my final respects. He was a man who helped a lot of people. He couldn\u2019t help everybody but I know a lot of people got opportunities because of him,\u201d he said.\n\nMichael Drakes said it was his first time ever witnessing a state funeral.\n\nHe said while there wasn\u2019t much fanfare, it was a memory he would keep forever.\n\n\u201cThis is a memory I will always have. Not as many people turned up as I would have expected but I\u2019m still glad I came. This is a part of history,\u201d he said.\n\n[email protected]\n\nRead our ePaper. Fast. Factual.
