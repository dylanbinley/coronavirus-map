Soon after, the Turkish government announced that the exploration works would continue till August 23.\n\nFollowing a call with the French President, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted, \u201cEmmanuel Macron is a true friend of Greece and a fervent defender of European values and international law.\u201d\n\nThe crisis arose from what is essentially a territorial conflict. Greece claimed that Turkey had violated international laws by venturing into an area, which is part of the Greek continental shelf. Since then, the countries\u2019 military forces have been on high alert as a diplomatic crisis unfurls in the area.\n\nDespite being NATO allies, this is not the first time Greece and Turkey have been at odds. Over the past four decades, the countries have nearly gone to war at least three times. Drilling explorations in the resource-rich Mediterranean has repeatedly proven to be a bone of contention between the countries.\n\nTheir most recent tussle seems to have been caused by a maritime agreement signed by Greece and Egypt, which expanded their access to the Mediterranean. Angered by the deal, Turkey restarted its drilling operations in the area mentioned in the Athens-Cairo agreement, the Guardian reported.\n\nIn this taken Monday, Aug. 10, 2020, Turkey\u2019s research vessel, Oruc Reis, center, is surrounded by Turkish navy vessels as it was heading in the west of Antalya on the Mediterranean, Turkey.

We are not chasing any unnecessary adventures or seeking tensions.\u201d\n\nIn what appears to be a reference to the support Greece has been receiving from France, Erdogan said that the country was being encouraged to take the \u201cwrong steps\u201d in the disputed region by a \u201ccountry that doesn\u2019t even have a coast in the eastern Mediterranean\u201d.\n\nEU to review Greece-Turkey tensions in meeting on Friday\n\nEuropean Union (EU) foreign ministers are set to meet on Friday to review the situation in the eastern Mediterranean, Belarus, and Lebanon, foreign policy chief Josep Borrell announced on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe will discuss urgent issues and address the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Belarus presidential elections as well as developments in Lebanon,\u201d Borrell tweeted.\n\nI will call an extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council meeting this Friday afternoon.
