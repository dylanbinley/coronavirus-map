People chanted \u201cBorissov, you are shame and disgrace\u201d and \u201cResignation.\u201d Many were following calls by the organizers to set up tents outside the Cabinet building and remain there until their demands are met.\n\nIn a video on Facebook, Borissov said everyone has the right to demonstrate, but not to block roads and intersections.\n\n\u201cElections are coming, everyone will be able to vote. This is democracy. Imagine we lose the election and start shutting down crossroads. Is that democracy?\u201d Borissov said.\n\nBorissov has been in power since 2009 and his third term is scheduled to end next March\n\nThe Associated Press", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Thousands in Bulgaria's streets demanding government resign - NEWS 1130", "description": "SOFIA, Bulgaria \u2014 Tens of thousands of people took to the streets Wednesday in cities across Bulgaria for a third consecutive week to demand the resignation of the government and the chief prosecutor.
