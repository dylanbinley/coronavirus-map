And above all you have the Constitution. So I am confident that Trump will turn out to be a transitory phenomenon, hopefully ending in November.\u201d\n\nDespite this prediction, Soros doesn\u2019t believe that the real estate mogul will go down easily. As many others have predicted, Soros believes that Trump will do anything to retain the presidency and \u201cremains very dangerous.\u201d The philanthropist\u2019s speculation comes just one day before progressive commentator Thom Hartmann predicted that Trump would work to harm American if he loses and use the months leading to Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration to sabotage the country.\n\nAs reported by Fox News, Soros claimed that the coronavirus pandemic has created a \u201crevolutionary moment\u201d with a more comprehensive \u201crange of possibilities\u201d than observed in \u201cnormal times.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is inconceivable in normal times becomes not only possible but actually happens. People are disoriented and scared. They do things that are bad for them and for the world.\u201d\n\nSean Gallup / Getty Images\n\nThe investor also used the wide-ranging interview to touch on financial markets and noted the current bubble created by Federal Reserve liquidity. According to Soros, the market is driven by the possibility of a coronavirus vaccine, as well as the hope of more fiscal stimulus. Interestingly, Hartmann claimed that Trump has intimidated the Federal Reserve System and now has the power to exacerbate the COVID-19-fueled economic crisis to sabotage a possible Biden presidency.\n\nWhile Soros fears Trump\u2019s actions, many right-wing theories paint the billionaire as the mastermind behind many facets of Democratic politics. His charity network, Open Society Foundations, regularly funds efforts to elect Democrats, and he has been an open critic of the president.\n\nAs The Inquisitr noted, Soros previously took aim at Facebook for allegedly attempting to help Trump win in November. He made the accusation at a private Open Society Foundations dinner in Davos, Switzerland, and expressed concern at the possible results of the upcoming election. Nevertheless, Facebook \u2014 which has been the target of the philanthropist\u2019s ire before \u2014 denied the accusations.", "METADATA": {"og": {"type": "article", "locale": "en_US", "title": "George Soros Believes Donald Trump Will Be A \u2018Transitory Phenomenon\u2019", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/6220350/george-soros-trump-transitory-phenomenon/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Billionaire Democratic donor George Soros, who is at the center of many right-wing theories, said in an Italian interview on Tuesday that he believes Donald Trump will be a \u201ctransitory ...", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/George-Soros.jpg", "width": 950, "height": 460}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-12T20:52:01+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@theinquisitr", "image": {"src": "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/George-Soros.jpg", "width": 950, "height": 460}, "description": "Billionaire Democratic donor George Soros, who is at the center of many right-wing theories, said in an Italian interview on Tuesday that he believes Donald Trump will be a \u201ctransitory ...", "creator": "@TylerWriter88"}, "description": "Billionaire Democratic donor George Soros, who is at the center of many right-wing theories, said in an Italian interview on Tuesday that he believes Donald Trump will be a \u201ctransitory ...", "keywords": "Donald Trump, george soros, Politics, US Politics", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, george soros, Politics, US Politics", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon-32x32.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "msvalidate.01": "1C6368F835120934051BE08C50A93BA3", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["Politics"]}}
