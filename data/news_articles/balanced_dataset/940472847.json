Alamu said all applicants for the teaching job would have to upload their credentials to the state\u2019s website to allow for equal participation and open process.\n\nHe said the examination would run from 7 am till 6 pm except on Sunday, reiterating that whoever could not upload his or her credentials to TESCOM\u2019s portal should not bother to write the test.\n\n\u201cThe results will be communicated to the applicants through the email they put in their registration and through SMS.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo applicant\u2019s complaints will be attended to at the CBT centres, if anybody has complaints, let them come to the TESCOM office, we wish them the best in the examination.\u201d\n\nAlamu hailed the state administration\u2019s resolve to conduct computer-based examination for all candidates applying for teaching appointment in the state, as according to him, the move has portrayed the government as being open in all its governance processes.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria.\n\nKindly Share This Story:", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=1300", "fb": {"pages": 125111084176530, "app_id": 1281965775160257}, "OBKey": "KoeDKhtk63NPK0HQB1Wydg==", "description": "Oyo State Government has warned private school owners to desist from demanding illegal fees from students who are at home due to COVID-19.", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Oyo warns private school owners on illegal fees - Vanguard News", "description": "Oyo State Government has warned private school owners to desist from demanding illegal fees from students who are at home due to COVID-19.", "url": "https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/08/oyo-warns-private-school-owners-on-illegal-fees/", "site_name": "Vanguard News", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Schools-Nigeria.jpg?fit=1286%2C768&ssl=1", "width": 1286, "height": 768}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/vanguardngr", "published_time": "2020-08-13T04:53:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T02:59:22+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@vanguardngrnews", "site": "@vanguardngrnews"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "google-site-verification": "AjRfeo4BMZn8J99wiq7X1DKIfO_z-Dnma_6csxvuRRg", "alexaVerifyID": "GKUIyYVwwNAjNpxpU_bP3ZbGFeo", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/favicon.png?fit=16%2C16&ssl=1"}}}
