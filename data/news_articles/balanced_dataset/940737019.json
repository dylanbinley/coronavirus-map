However, at this point, it looks like his owner is making amends for the feline\u2019s crimes.\n\nEarlier this month, BJ Ross from Altoona, Pennsylvania, created a Facebook group to address one of her pet cat Jordan\u2019s dirty habits: stealing their neighbors\u2019 shoes. According to WTAJ, the six-pound, black-and-white kitty is constantly going out during the night and returning home with loot in its jaws.\n\nRoss hopes social media will help to return the footwear to its respective owners, but has also made Jordan famous and now the whole world knows about his shenanigans.\n\nHere\u2019s a video, hilariously shaming the criminal\n\n\ufeff\n\nImage credits: WTAJ TV\n\nJordan the cat is stealing all footwear that he can get his paws on\n\nImage credits: Bj Ross\n\nHis owners find a couple of shoes every morning\n\nAnd now they have over 50\n\nJordan looks really proud of his stash\n\n\u201cIf y\u2019all know my cat Jordan, y\u2019all know he loves to bring me home shoes!\u201d the cat\u2019s owner wrote in the group.\n\nAfter learning about the cat\u2019s secret life, Jordan\u2019s owner BJ Ross put a GPS tracker on him\n\nAccording to Jordan\u2019s GPS tracker, this committed burglar maintains a large territory that encompasses multiple visits to houses all over the neighborhood. This could be because Jordan likes to present his owner with complete pairs, but \u2014 being a cat \u2013 can only carry one shoe at a time. A lesser cat burglar might find this limiting, but not Jordan. Plus, he prepares for his nightly misadventures with lots of proactive napping.\n\nHe can walk up to 7-8 miles a night, plotting a new heist\n\nRoss even installed a security cam in the back to collect more evidence\n\nRoss even created a Facebook group where people can discuss about Jordan and his crimes\n\nAnd everyone absolutely adores him", "METADATA": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "msapplication-config": "https://assets.boredpanda.com/blog/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "verification": "548dee23a897b7714d41cbb8f9e6e4f4", "google-site-verification": "DwZlwRtaWh6DY5ufVn4eVzMhiHh7zGoUVCUkHkBdGjo", "pocket-site-verification": "bfdd7261a0cb6c2d7868e5f77138f5", "p": {"domain_verify": "963d003ce13f416cadfbea235dbdaa72"}, "fb": {"pages": 126260014251, "app_id": 469101399768819}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@boredpanda"}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "site_name": "Bored Panda", "url": "https://www.boredpanda.com/cat-steals-shoes-jordan-the-feline-cat-burglar/", "title": "This Cat Loves Stealing His Neighbors\u2019 Shoes So Much, His Owner Even Created A Facebook Group To Return Them", "image": "https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cat-steals-shoes-jordan-the-feline-cat-burglar-fb41-png__700.jpg", "description": "Earlier this month, BJ Ross from Altoona, Pennsylvania, created a Facebook group to address one of her pet cat Jordan's dirty habits: stealing their neighbors' shoes."}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/boredpanda/", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/boredpanda/"}, "keywords": "700-page,bj ross,jordan the cat,animals,cats,homepage featured", "generator": "WordPress 4.9.8"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
