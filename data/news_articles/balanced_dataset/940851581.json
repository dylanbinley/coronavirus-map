Kamala Harris as his running mate, President Donald Trump was already floating one of his \u2018I don\u2019t know, but many people are saying ...\u2019 lies.\n\nAs he did with former president Barack Obama, Trump again threw out the idea that maybe, possibly, someone told him, that Harris might not actually have been born in the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s a despicable accusation (and one he never seems to direct at anyone who isn\u2019t Black). And it throws a little more gasoline on the racial bonfire that is 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s sad, and more than a little depressing, that we still have to go through this conversation. To continually listen to the code words and stereotypes and to know that in the minds of some people, the colour of one person\u2019s skin means they can be treated differently than another person.\n\nOur hands aren\u2019t clean in Canada. It is still an issue we are working our way through.\n\nBut things do happen that give us hope.\n\nSherri Darlene, a Niagara woman and founder of Justice 4 Black Lives, said this week the large turnout at a rally she organized in June \u201crestored her faith in humanity.\u201d\n\nUnless you regularly hear racial slurs, receive uncomfortable looks and find yourself treated just a little differently than other people, it is difficult to imagine the hurt that behaviour can cause.\n\nTo be wounded in your own community, and in the stores and places you go to every day. Among your neighbours.\n\nSpeaking to Niagara Falls city council earlier this week, she made the point that the best answer is education.\n\nHer proposal was for Justice 4 Black Lives \u2014 which she hopes to incorporate \u2014 to partner with organizations like Niagara College as well as local schools and museums.\n\n\u201cThe only way we can move forward is if we provide the right information,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd she\u2019s right. Education is the answer to this issue, as it is to many other problems that prevent us from being a better community.\n\nBut education only works if your eyes and ears are open.\n\nWe have to be smart enough to see through the distractions and hear through the noise that muddies relations between us all.\n\nThat means putting some thought into the news sources we rely on, and there are so many good ones.\n\nDon\u2019t accept arguments and scenarios just because they are what you want to hear; be willing to listen to, and maybe even accept, information that might change your outlook.\n\nThursday night, the issue of racism and policing dominated Niagara regional council\u2019s meeting.\n\nNiagara Regional Police Chief Bryan MacCulloch said the service has implemented changes, and is willing to continue doing so.\n\n\u201cIt is not in our interest to not serve our entire community. We are committed to that,\u201d he said.\n\nGet more from the Welland Tribune in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Welland Tribune.

The same issues that hold them back hold us all back.\n\nThey, and we, still have a ways to go.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicon-wellandtribune-144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicon-wellandtribune-70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicon-wellandtribune-150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicon-wellandtribune-310.png", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=379481068", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "wellandtribune.com", "application-name": "wellandtribune.com", "fb": {"pages": 134392236659479}, "storyuuid": "e83c8335-ae77-4123-83df-31b948c311b5", "keywords": "Opinion,editorial,Niagara Region,Niagara Falls,smg_editorials,smg2_opinion", "news_keywords": "Opinion,editorial,Niagara Region,Niagara Falls,smg_editorials,smg2_opinion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wellandtribune", "published_time": "2020-08-14", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T21:35:05.145Z", "section": "Editorials"}, "og": {"title": "We still have long way to go to end racism", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.wellandtribune.ca/opinion/editorials/2020/08/14/we-still-have-long-way-to-go-to-end-racism.html", "site_name": "wellandtribune.com", "image": "https://images.thestar.com/f-OjVU4ovDm-A0LejeLzJgCyo8E=/1200x717/smart/filters:cb(1597440903762)/https://www.wellandtribune.ca/content/dam/niagaradailies/opinion/editorials/2020/08/14/we-still-have-long-way-to-go-to-end-racism/falls_racism_protest.jpg", "images": "http://dispatcher.thestar.com/assets/img/wellandtribune-ribbon.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "wellandtribune.com", "site": "@WellandTribune", "title": "We still have long way to go to end racism", "image": "https://images.thestar.com/f-OjVU4ovDm-A0LejeLzJgCyo8E=/1200x717/smart/filters:cb(1597440903762)/https://www.wellandtribune.ca/content/dam/niagaradailies/opinion/editorials/2020/08/14/we-still-have-long-way-to-go-to-end-racism/falls_racism_protest.jpg", "creator": "Niagara Dailies Editorial"}, "parsely-title": "We still have long way to go to end racism", "parsely-link": "https://www.wellandtribune.ca/opinion/editorials/2020/08/14/we-still-have-long-way-to-go-to-end-racism.html", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-author": "Niagara Dailies Editorial", "parsely-image-url": "https://images.thestar.com/Dz5BmVzjlOU1iT2xDbXnmPadJe4=/93x56/smart/filters:cb(1597440903762)/https://www.wellandtribune.ca/content/dam/niagaradailies/opinion/editorials/2020/08/14/we-still-have-long-way-to-go-to-end-racism/falls_racism_protest.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-08-14T21:35:03.703Z", "parsely-section": "Editorials", "parsely-tags": "Opinion, editorial, Niagara Region, Niagara Falls, smg_editorials, smg2_opinion, word count: 350-700 words", "parsely-metadata": "{\"storyuuid\": \"e83c8335-ae77-4123-83df-31b948c311b5\"}"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
