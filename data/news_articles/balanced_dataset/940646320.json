But they acknowledge the numbers have increased sharply this year.\n\nSince 1 January, authorities in northern France have recorded around 350 attempts or crossings involving over 4,000 migrants, compared with 203 attempts and 2,294 migrants for the whole of 2019.\n\nThe Calais mayor on Thursday said the problem was of Britain\u2019s own making.\n\n\u201cIf the migrants want to cross [the Channel], it is because the British themselves put out the call. They have done so by failing to touch their legislation for 20 years,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTherefore I appeal to Boris Johnson, saying you urgently need to calm down, and urgently need to change your methods of \u2026 dealing with migrants.\u201d\n\nBouchart also had a message for Darmanin: \u201cDo not give in, because the British don\u2019t know how to negotiate. It\u2019s only by standing firm that you achieve something.\u201d\n\nJohnson on Monday said illegal migrant crossings of the Channel, which have hit record numbers, were \u201cvery bad and stupid and dangerous\u201d.", "METADATA": {"description": "Natacha Bouchart tells PM sending Navy ships into French waters is \u2018a declaration of maritime war\u2019", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/465800dca5274fe43ae530e68c47e80fd0362a32/954_153_1413_847/master/1413.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4d68bf0b67f16eef3a2ae95d2501fb06", "keywords": "Migration,Calais,Immigration and asylum,France,UK news,Refugees,Europe", "news_keywords": "Migration,Calais,Immigration and asylum,France,UK news,Refugees,Europe", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/14/calais-mayor-says-it-would-be-an-act-of-war-for-royal-navy-ships-to-enter-french-waters", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/465800dca5274fe43ae530e68c47e80fd0362a32/954_153_1413_847/master/1413.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0456401fc0cfd91c47d40af55a3332e6", "description": "Natacha Bouchart tells PM sending Navy ships into French waters is \u2018a declaration of maritime war\u2019", "type": "article", "title": "Calais mayor tells Boris Johnson to 'calm down' over migrant crossings", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "Agence France-Presse in Calais", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "World news", "published_time": "2020-08-13T23:38:25.000Z", "tag": "Migration,Calais,Immigration and asylum,France,UK news,Refugees,Europe", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T23:47:36.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2020/aug/14/calais-mayor-says-it-would-be-an-act-of-war-for-royal-navy-ships-to-enter-french-waters?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2020/aug/14/calais-mayor-says-it-would-be-an-act-of-war-for-royal-navy-ships-to-enter-french-waters?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/14/calais-mayor-says-it-would-be-an-act-of-war-for-royal-navy-ships-to-enter-french-waters", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2020/aug/14/calais-mayor-says-it-would-be-an-act-of-war-for-royal-navy-ships-to-enter-french-waters?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/465800dca5274fe43ae530e68c47e80fd0362a32/954_153_1413_847/master/1413.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=4173b5f930454eb483891b9e7ad8b7c1", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "dnt": "on"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
