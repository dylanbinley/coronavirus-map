At the time, sanctions experts thought it would be impossible to enforce the U.S. court order in international waters.\n\nA senior U.S. official told The Associated Press that no military force was used in the seizures and that the ships weren\u2019t physically confiscated. Rather, U.S. officials threatened ship owners, insurers, and captains with sanction to force them to hand over their cargo, which now becomes U.S. property, the official said.\n\nProsecutors alleged the four ships were transporting to Venezuela 1.1 million barrels of gasoline. But the tankers never arrived at the South American country and then went missing. Two of the ships later reappeared near Cape Verde, a second U.S. official said.\n\nBoth officials agreed to discuss the sensitive diplomatic and judicial offensive only if granted anonymity.\n\nIran\u2019s ambassador to Venezuela, Hojad Soltani, pushed back on what would appear a victory for the U.S. sanctions campaign, saying Thursday on Twitter that neither the ships nor their owners were Iranian.\n\n\u201cThis is another lie and act of psychological warfare perpetrated by the U.S. propaganda machine,\u201d Soltani said. \u201cThe terrorist #Trump cannot compensate for his humiliation and defeat by Iran using false propaganda.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear where the vessels \u2014 the Bella, Bering, Pandi, and Luna \u2014 or their cargoes currently are. But the ship captains weeks ago turned off their tracking devices to hide their locations, said Russ Dallen, a Miami-based partner at brokerage Caracas Capital Markets, who follows ship movements.\n\nThe Bering went dark on May 11 in the Mediterranean near Greece and has not turned on its transponder since, while the Bella did the same July 2 in the Philippines, Dallen said. The Luna and Pandi were last spotted when they were together in the Gulf of Oman on July 10 when the U.S. seizure order came. Shipping data shows that the Pandi, which also goes by Andy, is reporting that it has been \u201cbroken up,\u201d or sold as scrap, Dallen said.\n\nAs commercial traders increasingly shun Venezuela, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s socialist government has been increasingly turning to Iran.\n\nIn May, Maduro celebrated the arrival of five Iranian tankers delivering badly needed fuel to alleviate shortages that have led to days-long gas lines even in the capital, Caracas, which is normally spared such hardships.\n\nDespite sitting atop the world\u2019s largest crude reserves, Venezuela doesn\u2019t produce enough domestically refined gasoline and has seen its overall crude production plunged to the lowest in over seven decades amid its economic crisis and fallout from U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe Trump administration has been stepping up pressure on ship owners to abide by sanctions against U.S. adversaries like Iran, Venezuela, and North Korea. In May, it issued an advisory urging the global maritime industry to be on the lookout for tactics to evade sanctions like dangerous ship-to-ship transfers and the turning off of mandatory tracking devices \u2014 both techniques used in recent oil deliveries to and from both Iran and Venezuela.\n\nOne of the companies involved in the shipment to Venezuela, the Avantgarde Group, was previously linked to the Revolutionary Guard and attempts to evade U.S. sanctions, according to prosecutors.\n\nAn affiliate of Avantgarde facilitated the purchase for the Revolutionary Guard of the Grace 1, a ship seized last year by Britain on U.S. accusations that it was transporting oil to Syria. Iran denied the charges and the Grace 1 was eventually released. But the seizure nonetheless triggered an international standoff in which Iran retaliated by seizing a British-flagged vessel.\n\nAccording to the asset forfeiture complaint, an unnamed company in February invoiced Avantgarde for a $14.9 million cash payment for the sale of the gasoline aboard the Pandi. Nonetheless, a text message between Madanipour and an unnamed co-conspirator suggested the voyage had encountered difficulties.\n\n\u201cThe shipowner doesn\u2019t want to go because of the American threat, but we want him to go, and we even agreed We will also buy the ship,\u201d according to the message, an excerpt of which was included in the complaint.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 5.5", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"url": "http://noisyroom.net/blog/2020/08/14/4-tankers-headed-to-venezuela-stopped-by-us/", "type": "article", "title": "4 Tankers Headed to Venezuela, Stopped by US", "description": "By: Denise Simon | Founders Code MIAMI\u00a0\u2014 The Trump administration has seized the cargo of", "image": "http://noisyroom.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bella_1_wide-7f6e3f88cb14abbc9b96dd28f7a10386c1e399d8-600x337-1.png"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://noisyroom.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cropped-NoisyRoomHeader-270x270.jpg"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
