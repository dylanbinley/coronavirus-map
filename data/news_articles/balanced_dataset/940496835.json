It is unforgivable that they are not in place in August.\u201d\n\nMr Rozen also said the government had not released a crucial report into the first aged care outbreak at Dorothy Henderson Lodge, despite it happening in March.\n\n\u201cFor reasons that remain unclear the Commonwealth did not publish Professor (Lyn) Gilbert\u2019s important report,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s full of valuable lessons, and was written by a person with serious, high-level relevant expertise.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother lesson that does not appear to have been learned is that providers should plan to lose close to their entire workforce.\u201d\n\nmedia_camera Senior counsel assisting the Royal Commission into Aged Care Peter Rozen, QC, during hearings this week investigating devastating COVID-19 outbreaks in the sector. Picture: Supplied via NCA Newswire\n\nMr Rozen told the commission the government had been \u201con notice\u201d about the likelihood of COVID-19 ripping through the aged care sector, because of the Royal Commission into Aged Care\u2019s interim report, watching what was happening in Europe, and through warnings from experts.\n\n\u201cTragically, not all that could be done, was done,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe sector was not properly prepared in March, before the Dorothy Henderson Lodge and Newmarch House outbreaks. And based on the evidence that you\u2019ve heard, the sector is not properly prepared now.\u201d\n\nMr Rozen also discussed the \u201cloneliness\u201d of aged care residents not being able to see their friends and family during lockdowns in his closing address.\n\nHe repeated the words of aged care resident Merle Mitchell about her life in lockdown.\n\nSince early February.\n\n\u201cFrom the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep, I\u2019m sitting in my own room, on my one chair,\u201d she had told the commission.\n\nOn Wednesday, Federal Health Department Secretary Brendan Murphy, who was the country\u2019s Chief Medical Officer until June 25, told the commission that Australia did have a national plan for COVID-19 in aged care.\n\nBut Mr Rozen said that while it was a legitimate plan for the health sector, it \u201cwas silent\u201d in the specific problems of aged care.\n\n\u201cIt is a plan, it\u2019s just not an aged care plan,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Rozen said a plan for COVID-19 in aged care should have addressed:\n\n\u2013 Understaffing issues\n\n\u2013 Access to PPE and training in its proper use\n\n\u2013 Lack of infection control skills including \u201cfoundational\u201d standards that are \u201ctaken for granted in the health care sector\u201d\n\n\u2013 Challenges of stopping COVID-19 in the homelike setting of nursing homes, with many people living in proximity\n\n\u2013 The known \u201cchallenges\u201d of aged care providers dealing with the state health sector\n\n\u201cThere is no reason why our governments should be scrambling now to put such arrangements in place,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis should have been done back in February.\u201d\n\nOriginally published as \u2018Unforgivable\u2019 virus act slammed", "METADATA": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "referrer": "origin", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/goldcoastbulletin/ms-icon-70x70.png", "msapplication-square144x144logo": "https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/goldcoastbulletin/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/goldcoastbulletin/ms-icon-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/goldcoastbulletin/ms-icon-310x310.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/goldcoastbulletin/ms-icon-144x144.png", "robots": "noarchive", "description": "An investigation into the coronavirus deaths has heard about a litany of failures.
