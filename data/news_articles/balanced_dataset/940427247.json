Mohammad Shafi, manager of Discount City on Mission Street, said, \u201cAnybody but Trump,\u201d echoing Abeshaus\u2019 words almost exactly.\n\nShafi acknowledged that he is not a big fan of Biden, calling him too old and out of touch. He also didn\u2019t recognize Harris by name, and only remembered her when he was shown a picture. Despite this, he is eager to vote.\n\n\u201cPut it on the news: Mohammad Shafi thinks Donald Trump is crazy,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nOther residents expressed conflicted feelings on the democratic ticket.\n\nMolly deCoudreaux said that Biden was nowhere near her top choices for a presidential nominee, but Kamala Harris was originally in her top three. Now that he has taken Harris as his running mate, deCoundreaux is more excited for a Biden presidency. However, her feelings on Harris were not all positive.\n\n\u201cI do feel like the prosecutorial background she has is more conservative than I would like,\u201d deCoundreaux said.\n\nHarris\u2019 time as San Francisco\u2019s District Attorney, then as California\u2019s Attorney General, has regularly been criticized by progressive democrats who saw her as too punishing, specifically regarding the policy of citing parents when their children missed school. Others faulted her more for the situations in which she failed to punish enough.\n\nCaroline Lucia, who was shopping at Discount City and overheard Shafi saying he did not recognize Harris, advised him not to support her.\n\nLucia said that Harris\u2019 failure to seek the death penalty for David Hill is a defining factor in her opposition to Harris as a candidate. Hill was sentenced to life in prison in 2007 after being convicted of killing San Francisco Police Department officer Isaac Espinoza in 2004 while Harris was DA.\n\n\u201cI feel that Joe Biden just wanted to pick a female, a minority. I don\u2019t feel that she is the person for the job. I wouldn\u2019t want to vote for Biden because of her,\u201d Lucia said.\n\nSome, however, see Harris\u2019 prosecutor background as an advantage.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a prosecutor, which means she\u2019s well-spoken and knows how to deliver a message,\u201d Ortiz said.\n\nA man named Greg, who declined to give his last name, cited Harris\u2019 performance during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh among her most impressive feats.\n\nIn particular, Harris\u2019 line of pointed questions surrounding Kavanaugh\u2019s conversations with lawyers from Kasowitz Benson Torres, the law firm that represents President Trump, seemed to trip up the future Supreme Court justice.\n\nThe city supervisors who represent the Mission were not as conflicted in their statements on the matter.\n\nDistrict 6 Supervisor Matt Haney tweeted yesterday, \u201cI worked for her campaign in 2010 when she ran for AG, she swore me into School Board, & she\u2019s inspired me with her leadership as Senator.\u201d\n\nDistrict 9 Supervisor Hillary Ronen tweeted, \u201cIt\u2019s official Biden / Harris 2020 for the win!\u2026 Let\u2019s work with all we\u2019ve got for the next 87 days.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, during Biden and Harris\u2019 first official event together since the announcement, Biden said, \u201cI had a great choice, but I have no doubt that I picked the right person to join me as the next Vice President of the United States of America, and that\u2019s Senator Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\nDuring her remarks, Harris said that her entire career has been devoted to serving the people and, \u201cThe people are who Joe and I will fight for every day in the White House.\u201d\n\nKeep reading Mission Local and if you haven\u2019t already, think of supporting us.
