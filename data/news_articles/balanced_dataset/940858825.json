Britain's top travel firms", "TEXT": "More than \u00a31.4billion was wiped off the value of Britain's leading travel companies yesterday as quarantine chaos in France landed another blow to the industry's recovery.\n\nInvestors took flight from airlines and tour operators after the Government removed France, Malta and the Netherlands from the quarantine-free list leading to a dash for the border last night.\n\nA similar move in July saw travellers told that the 'air bridge' between Britain and Spain had been ditched with just a few hours' notice.\n\nInvestors took flight from airlines and tour operators after the Government removed France, Malta and the Netherlands from the quarantine-free list\n\nOfficial data yesterday laid bare the damage to customer confidence with close to two-thirds saying they would not travel abroad if they had to self-isolate upon their return.\n\nFewer than one in ten said they were likely to go on holiday abroad this year, compared to 64 per cent who went abroad last year.\n\nThere were also fears that British tourism would take a double hit as French leaders threatened retaliatory measures against Britain.\n\nAirline stocks, which had been on an upward trend in the last two weeks, were hammered again yesterday as the Government's decision threatened to snuff out the recovery weeks before the summer season ended.\n\nIAG, which owns British Airways, fell 4.8 per cent, Ryanair was down 3.3 per cent, Easyjet lost 6.5 per cent, Jet 2 owner Dart dropped 9 per cent and Wizz Air sank 1.2 per cent.\n\nTui, Britain's biggest tour operator, plunged 8.4 per cent lower.\n\nLandmark ruling: Lightning strikes the Eiffel Tower in Paris\n\nHotels were also hit with Whitbread, which owns Premier Inn, losing 3.2 per cent and Intercontinental Hotels, which owns Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza hotels, losing 1.8 per cent.\n\nIn total \u00a321.3billion has been wiped off travel stocks since February 20, equivalent to 36 per cent of their total market capitalisation, according to data from AJ Bell.\n\nIAG has lost \u00a38.3billion, or 67 per cent of its value, Easyjet has lost \u00a32.9billion and Tui has lost \u00a33.6billion of its market valuation.\n\nMore than 44,000 jobs are expected to be lost at Britain's largest travel companies and their suppliers.\n\nCompanies have been forced to shrink their operations with experts predicting it will take until 2023 for demand to return to pre-crisis levels.\n\nYesterday business leaders reacted with fury that a decision had again been made at such short notice, putting European travel into chaos.\n\nABTA, the association for travel industry, which sustains 220,000 jobs, said: 'The Government's measures to restrict travel will result in livelihoods being lost unless it can step in with tailored support for the travel industry.'\n\nPaul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy the PC Agency, said: 'The 14-day system of quarantine has to be changed.\n\n'If we're to learn to live with coronavirus then the Government has to invest in alternatives to blunt quarantine measures which damage economic recovery.'\n\nJohn Holland-Kaye, boss of Heathrow, has previously called for travellers to be tested before they fly and issued with coronavirus passports.\n\nYesterday a spokesman for the airport, which is expected to shed 25,000 jobs in the crisis, said: 'The UK needs a more sustainable long-term plan for the resumption of travel than quarantine roulette.\n\nWe urge the Government to work with us to trial a solution which could help to provide more certainty.'\n\nIndustry group Airlines UK said the new quarantines were 'another devastating blow to the travel industry already reeling from the worst crisis in its history'.", "METADATA": {"keywords":
