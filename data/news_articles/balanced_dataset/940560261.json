Historically, the United States is the largest exporter of weapons to Turkey.\n\nWhen Congress holds up sales of major weapon systems like tanks, planes and ships, it is typically meant to rebuke a country\u2019s specific military or political actions, such as when lawmakers attempted to block sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in 2019. But freezing arms sales is a diplomatic tool that the United States hasn\u2019t used against Turkey since 1978, after the Turkish military invaded Cyprus.\n\nDefense News learned of the situation from a half dozen sources in Congress, the administration, and the defense industry, all of whom requested anonymity because of the sensitivities involved.\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jim Risch, R-Idaho, and House Foreign Affairs ranking member Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, acknowledged they are part of the freeze after they were contacted by Defense News.\n\nThe two other lawmakers who can sign off on foreign military sales \u2015 House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and Senate Foreign Relations Committee ranking member Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., are also part of the hold, according to multiple Capitol Hill sources. Neither would comment for this story.\n\n\u201cThere is serious concern over [Turkey\u2019s purchase of the S-400] in both parties and in both chambers on the Hill, and until the issues surrounding this purchase are resolved I cannot and will not support weapon sales to Turkey,\u201d Risch said in an email to Defense News.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "fb": {"app_id": 1426707697595729, "admins": "100004734420350,797039667,100002671421559,100003124265944,1362981583,100003179886751,100011772604024"}, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "author": "Helix Consulting LLC", "og": {"title": "Congress has secretly blocked US arms sales to Turkey for nearly two years \u2013 Defense News", "description": "Congress has secretly blocked US arms sales to Turkey for nearly two years \u2013 Defense News", "image": "https://panorama.am/news_images/782/2343421_3/f5f354f4aab6da_5f354f4aab71c.thumb.jpg", "url": "https://www.panorama.am/en/news/2020/08/13/Congress-arms-sales-Turkey/2343421"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
