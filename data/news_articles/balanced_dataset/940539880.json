They had been in the water since 8.30pm on Wednesday.\n\nHelen Feeney, the mother of Sara Feeney, said they would forever be indebted to the fisherman who rescued them and that paddleboards would \u201cnever darken the doors of our houses again\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was just walking the dog on the beach while they went in for the paddle board on the beautiful evening that we had,\u201d she told RT\u00c9\u2019s Drivetime programme.\n\n\u201cWe had a lovely kind of chat and in good spirits and the next thing they were just going out . . . they seemed to be going out a bit far and I started to be kind of like [thinking] that\u2019s a bit far. It just went from the most serene of pictures to a little bit of anxiety and sort of then, you\u2019re telling yourself they\u2019ll be grand.\u201d\n\nGrowing increasingly anxious, she explained that when it grew dark and it did not look like they would come back she called the Coastguard.\n\n\u201cHorrific, it was the stuff of nightmares,\u201d she said of the unfolding situation. \u201cYou\u2019re just living by the second.\u201d\n\nAlthough the girls had been wearing lifejackets, they were not wearing wetsuits because of the fine weather conditions and their intentions only to go into the water for a short period, she said.\n\nHundreds searched\n\nHundreds of searchers had combed the coastline in south Connemara and north Clare all morning after an overnight search involving the Irish Coast Guard helicopters from Shannon and Sligo.\n\nThe cousins, who are from the Knocknacarra area of Galway city, were found clinging to the buoy of a lobster pot and were in good health. They were transferred by helicopter to University Hospital Galway.\n\nBarry Heskin, a member of the RNLI in Galway said the two women were lucky to be alive. He told RT\u00c9 radio\u2019s News at One that the women had been wearing buoyancy aids, which \u201cundoubtedly helped them\u201d but they had not been wearing wet suits.\n\nMr Heskin said Wednesday had been a \u201cvery dark night\u201d with heavy rain, thunder, lightning and high winds. \u201cI\u2019m sure they were very scared,\u201d he said. Fortunately the temperature of the water in Galway Bay had been relatively high recently, he added.\n\nThe rescue commenced at 10pm and initially it was just the RNLI as they thought the women would be found quickly, Mr Heskin said. When that didn\u2019t happen further resources were called in including the Aran life boat, the Coast Guard and Civil Defence. Later the garda\u00ed, the local flying club and volunteers including sailing clubs all joined in the search.\n\nThe \u201cphenomenal amount of support\u201d from the people of North Clare and around Galway Bay had meant the search could be divided up and could be spread further afield.\n\nMr Oliver and his son Morgan were given a hero\u2019s welcome when they returned to the docks in Galway on Thursday afternoon.\n\nMr Oliver (38) and his son Morgan were hailed for their role in saving the two females by correctly working out their location off the Aran Islands using tidal and weather information.\n\nAnd while the father and son team were being welcomed back the relieved families of Sara and Ellen were overjoyed at Galway University Hospital as they greeted the arrival of the Irish Coastguard helicopter from Inis Oirr with the rescued paddle boarders on board.\n\nThe families, including Ellen\u2019s dad Johnny Glynn, who captained Galway United to win the 1991 FAI Cup, hugged each other as the pair were taken from the helicopter and taken by ambulance on the short journey to the hospital to be checked out.\n\nWell-wishers greeted the two families as they made their way to the hospital while half an hour later another group lined the quayside to welcome home the father and son team, the latest in a long line of fishermen of the Oliver family from the Claddagh, who had made the remarkable rescue off the smallest of the Aran Islands shortly before noon.\n\nMr Oliver praised the cousins for \u2018doing everything right\u2019 to help them survive the night on the bay when the warm sunny evening gave way to a thunderous night of wind and rain.\n\n\u201cWe headed out of the docks as soon as we got the word they were missing and with the wind that was there last night and everything else we kind of predicted where they might have gone so we said we would head there, between Inis Oirr and the Clare coast.\n\n\u2018They did everything right\u2019\n\n\u201cThey did everything right. They held on to one another, they didn\u2019t lose touch and it can\u2019t have been easy with the night that was in. They had buoyancy aids but they didn\u2019t have wetsuits.\n\n\u201cWe told the lads in the lifeboat station that we would head in that direction and thankfully it worked out. It doesn\u2019t always work out this well,\u201d said Mr Oliver, who has served on the Galway Bay Lifeboat crew for years.\n\nMr Heskin said there was \u201cjumping around the station\u201d and a \u201cfew tears were shed when news came through about the safe recovery of the women. \u201cWe will be celebrating for the rest of the day,\u201d he said.\n\nKaren Golden and her friend Maeve Joyce were helping with the search on Thursday and said there was \u201cvery serious concern\u201d for the young women.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of anxiety and people were just so frightened for the families of the girls,\u201d Ms Joyce said. \u201cBecause it was so late in the day, the following day, there was a lot of concern it would be bad news.\u201d\n\nMs Golden said she got a text to say the women had been found alive and that \u201cthere was just enormous relief\u201d.\n\n\u201cMaeve went back to the people who were behind us and this lovely kind of chain of thumbs up went down among the people who were searching along the coast,\u201d Ms Golden said. \u201cEveryone was just so relieved.\u201d", "METADATA": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "description": "Cousins Sara Feeney (23) and Ellen Glynn (17) found safe and well clinging to lobster pot", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom14329346"}, "news_keywords": "News, John Fallon, Karen Golden, Maeve Joyce, Mr Heskin, Sarah Burns, Vivienne Clarke, Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, RT\u00c9, Sar, Furbo, Inis, Knocknacarra, Sligeach", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "all", "og": {"title": "Relieved mother of rescued women says paddleboards will never \u2018darken doors\u2019 again", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/relieved-mother-of-rescued-women-says-paddleboards-will-never-darken-doors-again-1.4329346", "site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "Cousins Sara Feeney (23) and Ellen Glynn (17) found safe and well clinging to lobster pot", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4329714&origw=1440", "secure_url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4329714&origw=1440", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IrishTimes", "creator": "@sarahburnss_", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/relieved-mother-of-rescued-women-says-paddleboards-will-never-darken-doors-again-1.4329346", "title": "Relieved mother of rescued women says paddleboards will never \u2018darken doors\u2019 again", "description": "Cousins Sara Feeney (23) and Ellen Glynn (17) found safe and well clinging to lobster pot", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4329714.1597339873!/image/image.jpg", "account_id": 15084853}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "fb": {"pages": 45441411157, "app_id": 1170474839675514}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
