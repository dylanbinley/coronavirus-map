It could be this side or that, and it could be Israel, which nobody can deny,\u201d he said.\n\nHezbollah was waiting for the Lebanese probe\u2019s results and if it found \u201cthis was a terrorist sabotage operation, and that Israel had a role, then not only Hezbollah will respond. The entire Lebanese state ... must respond,\u201d he said. \u201cIsrael will pay a price the size of the crime if it committed it.\u201d\n\nHezbollah, which exercises sway over government in Lebanon, has fought many wars with Israel.\n\nLebanon\u2019s Prosecutor General has pressed charges against 25 people, including senior port and customs officials, a judicial source said on Friday.\n\nNasrallah spoke shortly after Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif said while in Beirut that the international community should help Lebanon rather than impose its will on the country.\n\n\u201cIt is not humane to exploit the pain and suffering of the people for political goals,\u201d Zarif said, adding that Lebanon should decide on its future.\n\nInternational humanitarian aid has poured in but foreign states have linked financial assistance to reform of the Lebanese state, which has defaulted on its huge sovereign debts.\n\nLebanon's President Michel Aoun meets with Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at the presidential palace in Baabda, Lebanon August 14, 2020. Dalati Nohra/Handout via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY\n\nIran is seen as a major player in Lebanon through backing, arming and funding Hezbollah, established by the Revolutionary Guards in 1982. The movement is classified by the United States as a terrorist group.\n\nIran\u2019s role has led U.S.-allied Gulf Arab states in recent years to shy away from giving Lebanon financial support.\n\nZarif met President Michel Aoun who also met on Friday with U.S. and French officials in a diplomatic drive that has focused on urging Lebanon to fight corruption and enact long-delayed reforms to unlock foreign financial aid to resolve the worst economic crisis in its history.\n\nVisiting U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale said Lebanon needs to root out corruption, enact financial reforms, establish state control over ports and borders, and revamp the power sector.\n\nFrench Defence Minister Florence Parly called for the formation of a government capable of taking \u201ccourageous decisions\u201d.\n\nLebanese had been staging angry protests against their leaders who they blame for Lebanon\u2019s many woes even before the blast, which officials have blamed on more than 2,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored for years without safety measures.\n\nThe explosion sharpened anger at the authorities.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t live like this. The West has to pressure our leaders to save us,\u201d said Iyaam Ghanem, a Beirut pharmacist.\n\nVictims and their representatives told reporters that only an independent probe would deliver justice, appealing to the U.N. Security Council for an international investigation.\n\n\u201cIs it acceptable that people find their homes shattered, their families killed, their hopes and their dreams killed, with no justice?\u201d asked Paul Najjar, whose three-year-old daughter Alexandra died in the blast.", "METADATA": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1,
