If people weren't doing their job, that has to be investigated as well,\u201d Fleming said.\n\nFleming, who won election with the endorsement of law enforcement, said he supports properly funding the police but took issue with those allegedly acting in defense of the police.\n\n\u201cThey were hiding behind their support for the police. But they have nothing to do with supporting the police,\u201d he said.\n\nFleming said the City Council will meet Friday evening at 5 p.m. to discuss demonstration and police investigation.", "METADATA": {"description": "City police are investigating whether counter-protesters broke the law, according to one council member and a department press release.", "keywords": "Capital Public Radio, CPR, Violent Attacks Against Black Lives Matter Demonstrators In Nevada City Spark Investigation", "nid": 155006, "programs": "none", "datePublished": "2020-08-13", "has_audio": 0, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "og": {"title": "Violent Attacks Against Black Lives Matter Demonstrators In Nevada City Spark Investigation", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.capradio.org/155006", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.capradio.org/media/12253718/101019nevadacitydscf9686-p.jpg", "width": 1067, "height": 800}, "description": "City police are investigating whether counter-protesters broke the law, according to one council member and a department press release."}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
