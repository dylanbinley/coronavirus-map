We\u2019ve basically tried to educate them on what\u2019s going on, what\u2019s happening in the world, what do we know, what do we not know,\u201d said Martins, who lives in Vancouver. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken it on. They want to keep me safe, they want to keep grandma safe \u2014 they\u2019re really OK with wearing masks.\u201d\n\nMartins thinks it\u2019s unacceptable that B.C.\u2019s return-to-school plan doesn\u2019t mandate face-coverings in schools, and hopes that will change.\n\nProvincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has said there is a role for masks in schools, and recommends them for adults and older students when they can\u2019t maintain their distance, such as in hallways or on buses.\n\nHenry said this week that it\u2019s not realistic to expect a young child to wear a mask all day long in class. They\u2019re not recommended for use by young children, and they can lead to increased face- and eye-touching.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of things that we can do to make those environments safe without requiring somebody to sit with a mask on for a long period of time,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ll be looking at.\u201d\n\nA new poll from Insights West found that 79 per cent of respondents support mandatory masks for teachers and staff, with majority support for mask-wearing for high-school students (77 per cent), middle school (73 per cent), older kids (67 per cent) and younger children (58 per cent).\n\nCindy Cheung has two sons, ages eight and 13, who are going into Grades 2 and 8 in Richmond. She said her youngest fiddles with his mask when he is wearing it, sometimes reaching inside to scratch an itch, so she understands why wearing a mask all day might not work for small children. However, she could see masks being useful for older kids.\n\n\u201cMy stance is mask-wearing can be one of the methods that can help, but I don\u2019t think it will stop an outbreak from happening,\u201d Cheung said.\n\nHer 13-year-old son said he would be fine wearing a mask all day if necessary, but he\u2019d rather not return to school at all, because he doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s safe. Cheung said she would like to have more options when it comes to educating her kids during the pandemic.\n\nSuzanna Dextraze is willing to do whatever it takes to get her daughter off to her first day of Kindergarten in Burnaby. She and her partner wear masks when they go shopping and the like, but her five-year-old daughter and toddler twins don\u2019t. She said her daughter is curious about masks and she is considering buying her one.\n\nDextraze is comfortable with the current guidelines from the province regarding masks in schools, but if that changes she is willing to be flexible.\n\n\u201cIf wearing a mask all the time is a condition that will give her an opportunity to go back to school, I don\u2019t have any problems with that,\u201d Dextraze said.\n\nAleicia Vincent is a mother of three and a teacher in Powell River. She said her children, who are in Grades 1, 3 and 8, are capable of wearing masks for extended periods of time and she feels the bar for safety is being lowered for schools.\n\nClassrooms are enclosed, crowded spaces and Vincent believes it\u2019s impossible to physically distance under the current conditions. She and her eldest son will wear masks when school resumes in September, and she is considering keeping her youngest children at home for a few weeks to see whether guidelines change. When they return, they will also wear masks all day.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that schools have virtually no protections that actually work in the reality of schools, as the plan is written. Anyone who works in schools know this is a plan for schools that only exist in the heads of legislators,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need masks because, while it should be a last line of defence, it is in reality one of our only defences.\u201d\n\nB.C. Education Minister Rob Fleming said this week that all students and staff will be provided with reusable, non-medical masks, upon request, when they return to school.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the funding envelope for the restart-to-school this September in British Columbia, so that\u2019s something that our health-and-safety working group is working on in co-ordination with the provincial health office,\u201d Fleming said.\n\nDirectives regarding masks in schools vary from province-to-province.\n\nIn Alberta, students in Grades 4 to 12 and staff must wear masks in all shared and common areas or where physical distance can\u2019t be maintained. They\u2019re not required in the classroom if they\u2019re following the physical-distancing guidelines, and for younger students, masks are optional.\n\nOntario has mandated masks for students in Grades 4 to 12, including while they\u2019re in classrooms, and they\u2019re strongly encouraged for younger children when they\u2019re in common areas inside. Staff will wear masks.\n\nOther provinces, such as Manitoba, aren\u2019t mandating masks.\n\nB.C.\u2019s Ministry of Education said it\u2019s looking, along with Henry\u2019s office, at the latest guidelines on mask-wearing and will update the public on health-and safety-protocols for schools as planning progresses with working groups.\n\njensaltman@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/jensaltman\n\nCLICK HERE to report a typo.\n\nIs there more to this story?
