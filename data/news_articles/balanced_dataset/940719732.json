Though there are signs that\u2019s changing.\n\nNon-profit foundation, The Privacy Collective, has filed one case today with the District Court of Amsterdam, accusing the two data broker giants of breaching the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in their processing and sharing of people\u2019s information via third party tracking cookies and other adtech methods.\n\nThe Dutch case, which is being led by law-firm bureau Brandeis, is the biggest-ever class action in The Netherlands related to violation of the GDPR \u2014 with the claimant foundation representing the interests of all Dutch citizens whose personal data has been used without their consent and knowledge by Oracle and Salesforce.\n\nA similar case is due to be filed later this month at the High Court in London England, which will make reference to the GDPR and the UK\u2019s PECR (Privacy of Electronic Communications Regulation) \u2014 the latter governing the use of personal data for marketing communications. The case there is being led by law firm Cadwalader.\n\nUnder GDPR, consent for processing EU citizens\u2019 personal data must be informed, specific and freely given. The regulation also confers rights on individuals around their data \u2014 such as the ability to receive a copy of their personal information.\n\nIt\u2019s those requirements the litigation is focused on, with the cases set to argue that the tech giants\u2019 third party tracking cookies, BlueKai and Krux \u2014 trackers that are hosted on scores of popular websites, such as Amazon, Booking.com, Dropbox, Reddit and Spotify to name a few \u2014 along with a number of other tracking techniques are being used to misuse Europeans\u2019 data on a massive scale.\n\nPer Oracle marketing materials, its Data Cloud and BlueKai Marketplace provider partners with access to some 2BN global consumer profiles. (Meanwhile, as we reported in June, BlueKai suffered a data breach that exposed billions of those records to the open web.)\n\nWhile Salesforce claims its marketing cloud \u2018interacts\u2019 with more than 3BN browsers and devices monthly.\n\nBoth companies have grown their tracking and targeting capabilities via acquisition for years; Oracle bagging BlueKai in 2014 \u2014 and Salesforce snaffling Krux in 2016.\n\nIn this case, NYT is sharing visitor data with e.g.: \u2013 https://t.co/NMsaCzjhv5, Oracle, claims to have profiles on 2bn consumers\n\n\u2013 https://t.co/foiigL4T9C: Lotame, claims to have profiles on 3bn users\n\n\u2013 https://t.co/BCmd8oKDoq: Salesforce DMP, claims to 'interact' with 3bn users \u2014 Wolfie Christl (@WolfieChristl) March 23, 2018\n\nDiscussing the lawsuit in a telephone call with TechCrunch, Dr Rebecca Rumbul, class representative and claimant in England & Wales, said: \u201cThere is, I think, no way that any normal person can really give informed consent to the way in which their data is going to be processed by the cookies that have been placed by Oracle and Salesforce.\n\n\u201cWhen you start digging into it there are numerous, fairly pernicious ways in which these cookies can and probably do operate \u2014 such as cookie syncing, and the aggregation of personal data \u2014 so there\u2019s really, really serious privacy concerns there.\u201d\n\nThe real-time-bidding (RTB) process that the pair\u2019s tracking cookies and techniques feed, enabling the background, high velocity trading of profiles of individual web users as they browse in order to run dynamic ad auctions and serve behavioral ads targeting their interests, has, in recent years, been subject to a number of GDPR complaints, including in the UK.\n\nThese complaints argue that RTB\u2019s handling of people\u2019s information is a breach of the regulation because it\u2019s inherently insecure to broadcast data to so many other entities \u2014 while, conversely, GDPR bakes in a requirement for privacy by design and default.\n\nThe UK Information Commissioner\u2019s Office has, meanwhile, accepted for well over a year that adtech has a lawfulness problem. But the regulator has so far sat on its hands, instead of enforcing the law \u2014 leaving the complainants dangling. (Last year, Ireland\u2019s DPC opened a formal investigation of Google\u2019s adtech, following a similar complaint, but has yet to issue a single GDPR decision in a cross-border complaint \u2014 leading to concerns of an enforcement bottleneck.)\n\nThe two lawsuits targeting RTB aren\u2019t focused on the security allegation, per Rumbul, but are mostly concerned with consent and data access rights.\n\nShe confirms they opted to litigate rather than trying to try a regulatory complaint route as a way of exercising their rights given the \u201cDavid vs Goliath\u201d nature of bringing claims against the tech giants in question.\n\n\u201cIf I was just one tiny person trying to complaint to Oracle and trying to use the UK Information Commissioner to achieve that\u2026 they simply do not have the resources to direct at one complaint from one person against a company like Oracle \u2014 in terms of this kind of scale,\u201d Rumbul told TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cIn terms of being able to demonstrate harm, that\u2019s quite a lot of work and what you get back in recompense would probably be quite small. It certainly wouldn\u2019t compensate me for the time I would spend on it\u2026 Whereas doing it as a representative class action I can represent everyone in the UK that has been affected by this.\n\n\u201cThe sums of money then work \u2014 in terms of the depths of Oracle\u2019s pockets, the costs of litigation, which are enormous, and the fact that, hopefully, doing it this way, in a very large-scale, very public forum it\u2019s not just about getting money back at the end of it; it\u2019s about trying to achieve more standardized change in the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Salesforce and Oracle are not successful in fighting this then hopefully that send out ripples across the adtech industry as a whole \u2014 encouraging those that are using these quite pernicious cookies to change their behaviours,\u201d she added.\n\nThe litigation is being funded by Innsworth, a litigation funder which is also funding Walter Merricks\u2019 class action for 46 million consumers against Mastercard in London courts. And the GDPR appears to be helping to change the class action landscape in the UK \u2014 as it allows individuals to take private legal action. The framework can also support third parties to bring claims for redress on behalf of individuals. While changes to domestic consumer rights law also appear to be driving class actions.\n\nCommenting in a statement, Ian Garrard, managing director of Innsworth Advisors, said: \u201cThe development of class action regimes in the UK and the availability of collective redress in the EU/EEA mean Innsworth can put money to work enabling access to justice for millions of individuals whose personal data has been misused.\u201d\n\nA separate and still ongoing lawsuit in the UK, which is seeking damages from Google on behalf of Safari users whose privacy settings it historically ignored, also looks to have bolstered the prospects of class action style legal actions related to data issues.\n\nWhile the courts initially tossed the suit last year, the appeals court overturned that ruling \u2014 rejecting Google\u2019s argument that UK and EU law requires \u201cproof of causation and consequential damage\u201d in order to bring a claim related to loss of control of data.\n\nThe judge said the claimant did not need to prove \u201cpecuniary loss or distress\u201d to recover damages, and also allowed the class to proceed without all the members having the same interest.\n\nDiscussing that case, Rumbul suggests a pending final judgement there (likely next year) may have a bearing on whether the lawsuit she\u2019s involved with can be taken forward in the UK.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very much hoping that the UK judiciary are open to seeing these kind of cases come forward because without these kinds of things as very large class actions it\u2019s almost like closing the door on this whole sphere of litigation. If there\u2019s a legal ruling that says that case can\u2019t go forward and therefore this case can\u2019t go forward I\u2019d be fascinated to understand how the judiciary think we\u2019d have any recourse to these private companies for these kind of actions,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked why the litigation has focused on Oracle and Saleforce, given there are so many firms involved in the adtech pipeline, she said: \u201cI am not saying that they are necessarily the worst or the only companies that are doing this. They are however huge, huge international multimillion-billion dollar companies. And they specifically went out and purchased different bits of adtech software, like BlueKai, in order to bolster their presence in this area \u2014 to bolster their own profits.\n\n\u201cThis was a strategic business decision that they made to move into this space and become massive players. So in terms of the adtech marketplace they are very, very big players. If they are able to be held to account for this then it will hopefully change the industry as a whole. It will hopefully reduce the places to hide for the other more pernicious cookie manufacturers out there. And obviously they have huge, huge revenues so in terms of targeting people who are doing a lot of harm and that can afford to compensate people these are the right companies to be targeting.\u201d\n\nRumbul also told us The Privacy Collective is looking to collect stories from web users who feel they have experienced harm related to online tracking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence out there to show that how these cookies work means you can have very, very egregious outcomes for people at an individual level,\u201d she added. \u201cWhether that can be related to personal finance, to manipulation of addictive behaviors, whatever, these are all very, very possible \u2014 and they cover every aspect of our lives.\u201d\n\nConsumers in England and Wales and the Netherlands are being encouraged to register their support of the actions via The Privacy Collective\u2019s website.\n\nIn a statement, Christiaan Alberdingk Thijm, lead lawyer at Brandeis, said: \u201cYour data is being sold off in real-time to the highest bidder, in a flagrant violation of EU data protection regulations. This ad-targeting technology is insidious in that most people are unaware of its impact or the violations of privacy and data rights it entails. Within this adtech environment, Oracle and Salesforce perform activities which violate European privacy rules on a daily basis, but this is the first time they are being held to account. These cases will draw attention to astronomical profits being made from people\u2019s personal information, and the risks to individuals and society of this lack of accountability.\u201d\n\n\u201cThousands of organisations are processing billions of bid requests each week with at best inconsistent application of adequate technical and organisational measures to secure the data, and with little or no consideration as to the requirements of data protection law about international transfers of personal data. The GDPR gives us the tool to assert individuals\u2019 rights. The class action means we can aggregate the harm done,\u201d added partner Melis Acuner from Cadwalader in another supporting statement.\n\nWe reached out to Oracle and Salesforce for comment on the litigation.\n\nOracle EVP and general counsel, Dorian Daley, said:\n\nThe Privacy Collective knowingly filed a meritless action based on deliberate misrepresentations of the facts. As Oracle previously informed the Privacy Collective, Oracle has no direct role in the real-time bidding process (RTB), has a minimal data footprint in the EU, and has a comprehensive GDPR compliance program. Despite Oracle\u2019s fulsome explanation, the Privacy Collective has decided to pursue its shake-down through litigation filed in bad faith. Oracle will vigorously defend against these baseless claims.\n\nA spokeswoman for Salesforce sent us this statement:", "METADATA": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.techcrunch.com", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "generator": "WordPress 5.5", "sailthru.date": "2020-08-14 01:01:55", "sailthru.title": "Oracle and Salesforce hit with GDPR class action lawsuits over cookie tracking consent", "sailthru.tags": "Amazon, bluekai, Booking.com, consumer rights law, data protection, data protection law, data security, digital rights, Dropbox, european union, GDPR, General Data Protection Regulation, Google, information commissioner's office, ireland, Krux, law, London, Marketing, mastercard, Netherlands, online tracking, oracle, privacy, Salesforce, Spotify, United Kingdom", "sailthru.description": "The use of third party cookies for ad tracking and targeting by data broker giants Oracle and Salesforce is the focus of class action style litigation announced today in the UK and the Netherlands.
