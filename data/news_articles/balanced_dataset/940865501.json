In the first half of 2020 Cerrejon registered a loss of 368 billion pesos ($97.7 million).\n\nThe figures come amid a contract dispute between Cerrejon and its largest union, Sintracarbon.\n\nThe union\u2019s members are currently voting on whether to strike. The result is expected on Monday.\n\n\u201cDespite the economic situation, the company has made a very good offer that maintains the excellent economic benefits the company offers to each worker and which are superior to those received by many workers in La Guajira,\u201d Cerrejon president Claudia Bejarano said.\n\nBenefits include an 89% subsidy for health insurance, tuition help for workers\u2019 children, low-interest home loans and a signing bonus of 5.5 million pesos per worker.\n\nSintracarbon is demanding a 6% salary increase in addition to other benefits. It accuses Cerrejon of looking to cut costs by freezing, reducing and eliminating employee benefits.", "METADATA": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1,
