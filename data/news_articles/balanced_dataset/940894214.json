The funding would be partial downpayments to secure the shots, but actual purchases would be decided at a later stage by each EU state.\n\n\u201cThis new agreement will give all EU member states the option to access the vaccine in an equitable manner at no profit during the pandemic,\u201d AstraZeneca said in a statement.\n\nThe EU said it has been in advanced talks over the past two weeks with Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi for their vaccines under development. It is also in talks with Pfizer, Moderna and CureVac for upfront purchases of their potential Covid-19 vaccines, EU officials said in July.\n\nThe EU move could complicate efforts led by the WHO and GAVI, a global alliance for vaccines, to buy shots on behalf of rich and developing countries with a separate scheme.\n\nThe Commission has urged EU states to shun the WHO-led initiative because it sees it as too expensive and slow, EU officials said.\n\nNow the Commission is openly saying that vaccines bought from AstraZeneca, and from other vaccine makers, could be donated to poorer states, effectively taking on the very task that the WHO is pursuing with the so-called ACT-Accelerator Hub.\n\nBrussels has publicly said that its purchasing scheme is complementary to the WHO\u2019s, but in private told EU states that there may be legal issues if they joined the WHO programme.\n\nBruce Aylward, the WHO senior adviser who leads the ACT-Accelerator Hub, downplayed fears that bilateral deals could scuttle the WHO\u2019s multilateral push.\n\nHe said late on Thursday that some countries that have reserved vaccines for their populations had also expressed interest in participating in a global rollout.\n\n\u201cYou hear a lot of panic about buying, deals, etc. But we have a couple of months to work together as a global community,\u201d he said, adding that pooling risks and buying together was the ideal solution.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 15th, 2020", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "subject": "Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.", "description": "The agreement can weaken WHO's plans for a global approach.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383068068604634, "pages": 86398345441}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "DAWN.COM", "url": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1574486", "type": "article", "title": "EU agrees first Covid-19 vaccine deal with British drugmaker in WHO blow", "description": "The agreement can weaken WHO's plans for a global approach.", "image": "http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@dawn_com", "url": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1574486", "title": "EU agrees first Covid-19 vaccine deal with British drugmaker in WHO blow", "description": "The agreement can weaken WHO's plans for a global approach.", "image": "http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.dawn.com", "published_time": "2020-08-15 06:58:20", "modified_time": "2020-08-15 10:59:17", "author": "https://www.dawn.com/authors/422/reuters"}, "author": "Reuters"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": true, "NOTES": []}}
