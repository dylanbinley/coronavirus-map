We will use the centenary next year to promote it on the world stage.\n\n\"The establishment of a Centenary Forum and Centenary Historical Advisory Panel will offer us the opportunity to work with a broad spectrum of people, including those from across the political parties, business, tourism and the voluntary and community sectors, to deliver an ambitious and exciting programme of events to mark this significant national anniversary for the UK.\"", "METADATA": {"language": "en", "generator": "Isle Interactive Ltd", "designer": "Isle Interactive Ltd", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "application-name": "Politics Home", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00a3a6", "msapplication-config": "/_img/_favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "14 days", "og": {"site_name": "Politics Home", "locale": "en_GB", "title": "Boris Johnson talks up close ties with Northern Ireland ahead of Brexit trade deal deadline", "description": "Boris Johnson has set out plans to boost ties with Northern Ireland ahead of the next round of Brexit trade talks.", "url": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/boris-johnson-talks-up-close-ties-with-northern-ireland-ahead-of-brexit-trade-deal-deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dyw8mv3b0/image/upload/q_85,w_1200,h_1200,c_limit/v1/news/2020_08/pa-47035831_lmjz5k_urvu2s.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-12 17:36:38", "modified_time": "2020-08-13 06:21:18"}, "Description": "Boris Johnson has set out plans to boost ties with Northern Ireland ahead of the next round of Brexit trade talks.", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@politicshome", "url": "https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/boris-johnson-talks-up-close-ties-with-northern-ireland-ahead-of-brexit-trade-deal-deadline", "title": "Boris Johnson talks up close ties with Northern Ireland ahead of Brexit trade deal deadline", "description": "Boris Johnson has set out plans to boost ties with Northern Ireland ahead of the next round of Brexit trade talks.", "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dyw8mv3b0/image/upload/q_85,w_1200,h_1200,c_limit/v1/news/2020_08/pa-47035831_lmjz5k_urvu2s.jpg"}}}}
