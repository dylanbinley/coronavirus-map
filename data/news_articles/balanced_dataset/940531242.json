Thus, this festival of democracy could run peacefully and fairly, he emphasized.\"The strict enforcement of health protocols will also reflect sound management and offer a sense of safety and security to voters that would also have a positive impact on the participation rates,\" he noted.President Jokowi also stressed on the importance of enforcing health protocols across all stages of this year's simultaneous regional elections to ensure that this democratic process runs in a fair and peaceful manner and does not lead to the creation of new COVID-19 clusters.\"Of course, this is a new momentum to demonstrate a new approach to hold simultaneous regional elections and an innovative way for both organizers and participants to practice democracy amid this COVID-19 pandemic situation,\" he affirmed.Some 270 regions in Indonesia, comprising nine provinces, 224 districts, and 37 cities, will hold regional elections on Dec 9, 2020.EDITED BY INE", "METADATA": {"description": "The General Elections Commission (KPU) found that 7,256 Indonesian migrant workers in Malaysia were registered as eligible voters for this year&#39;s ...", "author": "antaranews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"title": "7,256 Indonesians in Malaysia registered as voters in Nunukan: KPU - ANTARA News", "type": "website", "description": "The General Elections Commission (KPU) found that 7,256 Indonesian migrant workers in Malaysia were registered as eligible voters for this year&#39;s ...", "image": "https://cdn.antaranews.com/cache/800x533/2020/07/24/IMG20200724113224.jpg", "site_name": "Antara News", "locale": "en", "url": "https://en.antaranews.com/news/154154/7256-indonesians-in-malaysia-registered-as-voters-in-nunukan-kpu"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/antaranewsdotcom", "section": "Indonesia"}, "fb": {"app_id": 558190404243031}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@antaranewsen", "creator": "@antaranewsen", "title": "7,256 Indonesians in Malaysia registered as voters in Nunukan: KPU - ANTARA News", "description": "The General Elections Commission (KPU) found that 7,256 Indonesian migrant workers in Malaysia were registered as eligible voters for this year&#39;s ...", "image": "https://cdn.antaranews.com/cache/800x533/2020/07/24/IMG20200724113224.jpg", "domain": "en.antaranews.com"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://en.antaranews.com/img/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}}}
