Iran\u2019s population is around 80 million.\n\nThe shock statement was compounded by Rouhani\u2019s suggestion his government was now hoping to overcome the Middle East\u2019s worst outbreak via herd immunity.\n\nRussia calls vaccine concerns \u2018absolutely groundless\u2019\n\nIran\u2019s vaccine announcement followed claims by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday that his country had completed development of a vaccine, and that he had even seen it administered to his daughter.\n\nThe announcement was met with widespread skepticism over safety concerns by international experts, who fear Russia is advancing the vaccine too quickly for political purposes.\n\nThe vaccine was granted regulatory approval after less than two months of human tests.\n\nRussian officials said that large-scale production of the vaccine will start in September, and mass vaccination may begin as early as October. Moscow\u2019s Health Ministry said that the vaccine was expected to provide immunity from the coronavirus for up to two years.\n\nRussia has been pushing hard to quickly develop a coronavirus vaccine and said earlier this month it hoped to launch mass production within weeks and turn out \u201cseveral million\u201d doses per month by next year. It is the first country to register a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nRussia said on Wednesday it would begin administering the vaccine to medical personnel who volunteer for a final trial within two weeks, the Reuters news agency reported.\n\nAlso Wednesday, Russia dismissed growing international fears over the vaccine.\n\n\u201cIt seems our foreign colleagues are sensing the specific competitive advantages of the Russian drug and are trying to express opinions that\u2026 are absolutely groundless,\u201d Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said.\n\nScientists from the US, France, Germany and Spain all expressed concern over the shot\u2019s speedy approval, the BBC reported.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US, told National Geographic on Tuesday, \u201cI hope that the Russians have actually definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective.\u201d\n\n\u201cI seriously doubt that they\u2019ve done that,\u201d Fauci said.\n\nGerman Health Minister Jens Spahn said, \u201cIt can be dangerous to start vaccinating millions\u2026 of people too early because it could pretty much kill the acceptance of vaccination if it goes wrong.\u201d\n\nWhen the pandemic struck Russia, Putin ordered state officials to shorten the time of clinical trials for potential coronavirus vaccines.\n\nBecoming the first country in the world to develop a vaccine was a matter of national prestige for the Kremlin as it tries to assert the image of Russia as a global power. State television stations and other media have praised scientists working on it and presented the work as the envy of other nations.\n\nMany scientists questioned the decision to register the vaccine before Phase 3 trials that normally last for months and involve thousands of people. Some have suggested researchers might be cutting corners and coming under pressure from authorities to deliver.\n\nThe World Health Organization said any WHO stamp of approval on a COVID-19 vaccine candidate would require a rigorous safety data review.\n\nHealth Minister Yuli Edelstein said Tuesday that Israel was interested in holding discussions with Russia about its claims on its vaccine.\n\nEdelstein told reporters: \u201cWe have already arranged discussions about the research center in Russia and the development of a vaccine. If we are convinced that it is a genuine product then we will try to enter into negotiations.\u201d\n\nThe pandemic has seen an unprecedented mobilization of funding and research to rush through a vaccine that can protect billions of people worldwide.\n\nExperts have warned that vaccines that are not properly tested can cause harm in many ways \u2014 from a negative impact on health to creating a false sense of security or undermining trust in vaccinations.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=1024", "description": "Iranian health minister says domestically produced shot passed animal trials; Russia calls widespread skepticism over its vaccine rollout 'absolutely groundless'", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/images/toi_icon_144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 123142304440875}, "og": {"url": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-claims-it-is-testing-three-to-four-vaccines-on-humans/", "type": "article", "title": "Iran claims it is testing \u2018three to four\u2019 COVID-19 vaccines on humans", "description": "Iranian health minister says domestically produced shot passed animal trials; Russia calls widespread skepticism over its vaccine rollout 'absolutely groundless'", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2020/08/Untitled-5-1-1024x640.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 640}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "timesofisrael", "title": "Iran claims it is testing \u2018three to four\u2019 COVID-19 vaccines on humans", "description": "Iranian health minister says domestically produced shot passed animal trials; Russia calls widespread skepticism over its vaccine rollout 'absolutely groundless'", "image": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2020/08/Untitled-5-1-1024x640.jpg"}}}}
