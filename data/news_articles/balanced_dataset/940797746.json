Or there is a duty to perform an act and a person fails to perform it in a grossly negligent matter.\u201d\n\nThe analyst pointed to Trump\u2019s alleged failure to act appropriately as president amid the pandemic, which he equates to gross negligence.\n\nThe second factor, Kirschner said, consists of \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d failure to engage in actions or engagement in actions that reasonable calculations determined would lead to death or serious bodily injury. For this element, the prosecutor claimed that Trump\u2019s failure to react appropriately to contain COVID-19 satisfies the criteria.\n\nThe former Robert Mueller prosecutor said the final element of the charge is causation, which he said must prove that Trump\u2019s COVID-19 response was not just \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d but \u201creasonably likely\u201d to cause serious bodily injury or death.\n\nChip Somodevilla / Getty Images\n\nKirschner has been outspoken about his belief that Trump is guilty of crimes. As The Inquisitr reported, the previously told The Intercept\u2019s Mehdi Hasan that the president could be prosecuted after leaving office for his alleged dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their 2018 summit in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nAccording to the legal analyst, the American president provided Putin with aid and comfort, which he said falls into the crime of \u201caccessory after the fact\u201d under the U.S. Criminal Code Section 3.\n\nTrump\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis has been polarizing and pushed many to suggest that he face criminal charges, The Independent reported. His niece, Mary Trump, author of Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Man, previously said he should be charged for his handling of the crisis, which has killed approximately 167,000 Americans as of Friday afternoon.\n\n\u201cIf you have it in your power to save somebody\u2019s life but stand by and do nothing, isn\u2019t that negligent homicide or something like that?\u201d she asked.\n\nThe clinical psychologist pointed to Trump\u2019s purportedly partisan approach to dealing with state governors amid the pandemic and suggested this strategy, which she linked to American deaths, was tantamount of a crime. Mary Trump claimed that the president has \u201cno accountability\u201d for his actions and must face a \u201creckoning\u201d for the purported destruction he has caused.", "METADATA": {"og": {"type": "article", "locale": "en_US", "title": "Donald Trump Is Guilty Of \u2018Negligent Homicide\u2019 For Coronavirus Response, Legal Analyst Says", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/6224138/trump-negligent-homicide-coronavirus/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "During an interview with Salon writer Chauncey Devega, MSNBC legal analyst Glenn Kirschner said that Donald Trump is guilty of \u201cnegligent homicide\u201d for his response to the coronavirus ...", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Donald-Trump-80.jpg", "width": 950, "height": 460}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T15:52:33+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@theinquisitr", "image": {"src": "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Donald-Trump-80.jpg", "width": 950, "height": 460}, "description": "During an interview with Salon writer Chauncey Devega, MSNBC legal analyst Glenn Kirschner said that Donald Trump is guilty of \u201cnegligent homicide\u201d for his response to the coronavirus ...", "creator": "@TylerWriter88"}, "description": "During an interview with Salon writer Chauncey Devega, MSNBC legal analyst Glenn Kirschner said that Donald Trump is guilty of \u201cnegligent homicide\u201d for his response to the coronavirus ...", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Politics, US Politics", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Politics, US Politics", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon-32x32.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "msvalidate.01": "1C6368F835120934051BE08C50A93BA3", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["Politics", "Not Local News"]}}
