The trend lines are very different today, and we see the future is very much in the Gulf and with Israel, and the past is with the Iranian regime. It clings to power on the basis of brute force,\u201d he added.\n\nHook also praised the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign designed to squeeze Tehran into submission through crushing sanctions and financial pressure. He said the policy has resulted in \u201cincredible results.\u201d\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, agreed \u201cto the full normalization of relations\u201d between the countries during a phone call on Thursday, according to the White House. The move is historic and comes after the UAE began direct humanitarian aid flights to Israel earlier this year.\n\nIt was announced last week that Hook is leaving his role and would be replaced by Elliott Abrams, who previously served as the U.S. special representative for Venezuela. The Washington Examiner reached out to the State Department for comment.\n\n", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "pages": "page"}, "description": "A top U.S. diplomat who helped forge the deal to normalize relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates said the pact is a blow to Iran.", "brightspot.contentId": "00000173-e888-de9c-a57f-fcacb00b0001", "og": {"title": "US Iran envoy says peace between Israel and Arabs is Tehran's 'worst nightmare'", "url": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/us-iran-envoy-says-peace-between-israel-and-arabs-is-tehrans-worst-nightmare", "image": {"identifier": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cc8d36c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+61/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F33%2F00%2Fa0bad4ef4e72b960a9868209dfc9%2Fap20100273930637.jpg", "url": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cc8d36c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+61/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F33%2F00%2Fa0bad4ef4e72b960a9868209dfc9%2Fap20100273930637.jpg", "secure_url": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cc8d36c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+61/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F33%2F00%2Fa0bad4ef4e72b960a9868209dfc9%2Fap20100273930637.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/png", "alt": "Virus Outbreak Mideast Iran"}, "description": "A top U.S. diplomat who helped forge the deal to normalize relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates said the pact is a blow to Iran.", "site_name": "Washington Examiner", "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/author/zachary-halaschak", "published_time": "2020-08-13T16:07:14.325", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T16:30:45.137", "section": "News", "tag": "National Security"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A top U.S. diplomat who helped forge the deal to normalize relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates said the pact is a blow to Iran.", "image": {"identifier": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7570ba4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1288+0+18/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F33%2F00%2Fa0bad4ef4e72b960a9868209dfc9%2Fap20100273930637.jpg", "alt": "Virus Outbreak Mideast Iran"}, "site": "@DCExaminer", "title": "US Iran envoy says peace between Israel and Arabs is Tehran's 'worst nightmare'", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "brightspot.cached": "true", "dy": {"url": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/us-iran-envoy-says-peace-between-israel-and-arabs-is-tehrans-worst-nightmare"}}}}
