Its President Milos Zeman has been promoting closer ties with China.\n\nMr Pompeo also acknowledged the chairman of the Czech Senate, Mr Milan Vystrcil, who followed through on a plan by his deceased predecessor to visit Taiwan at the end of this month, a trip that has angered China.\n\nMr Pompeo said some nations in Europe would take longer to wake up to the threats, but there was a positive momentum.\n\n\"The tide has turned (in the US), just as I see it turned here in Europe as well. The West is winning, don't let anyone tell you about the decline of the West,\" he said.\n\n\"It will take all of us... here in Prague, in Poland, in Portugal. We have the obligation to speak clearly and plainly to our people, and without fear. We must confront complex questions... and we must do so together,\" he said.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "al": {"web": {"url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/economic-clout-makes-china-tougher-challenge-for-us-than-soviet-union-was-pompeo"}, "ios": {"app_store_id": 547465441, "url": "straitstimes://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/economic-clout-makes-china-tougher-challenge-for-us-than-soviet-union-was-pompeo", "app_name": "Straits Times"}}, "description": "PRAGUE (REUTERS) - China's global economic power makes the communist country in some ways a more difficult foe to counter than the Soviet Union during the Cold War, US.
