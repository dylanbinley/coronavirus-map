However the Barbados government press release giving details of his speech featured a picture of an unspecified soda drink can.\n\nPhillips was speaking at the virtual launch of a mass media campaign on Childhood Obesity Prevention, hosted by the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Barbados.\n\nThe public health official noted the shift away from the consumption of locally prepared foods within the home to those prepared outside of the home, which were frequently high in salt, refined sugars, cholesterol, trans-fats and saturated fats.\n\nAnd he also pointed to the World Health Organization\u2019s Global School Health Survey, which was conducted in 26 secondary schools in the island. It indicated that children were not achieving the recommended level of physical activity and exercise.\n\n\u201cDespite the achievements garnered by the Ministry of Health and Wellness in ensuring that the health of the child is protected, the strengthening, coordination and management of obesity prevention continue to be challenging,\u201d he shared.\n\nDr. Phillips revealed that the Ministry was working closely with the Ministry of Education, Technological and Vocational Training in respect of the implementation of policies and programmes within the National Plan for Childhood Obesity Prevention, including the formulation and implementation of a national school nutrition policy.\n\nHealth authorities were also focusing, he said, on engaging manufacturers and distributors of food products regarding the reformulation of products to reduce the levels of salt, fat and sugar in locally produced foods. These meetings will also address the need for affordable healthy options, he added.\n\n\u201cWe will work with partners, including those in agriculture and commerce, in both the public and private sectors to reach these goals,\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Marketing Of Unhealthy Food To Children \"Subtle And Not-So-Subtle\" Says Barbados Health Leader. - The St Kitts Nevis Observer", "description": "The Barbados Ministry of Health and Wellness continues to be concerned about the \u201csubtle and not so subtle\u201d marketing of unhealthy food to children.
