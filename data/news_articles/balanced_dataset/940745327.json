Simply calling for a change of management personnel misses the fundamental flaw in the current structure. Talk of competition between airports on an island of our size was always a nonsensical policy\u201d he concluded.\n\nFor more Limerick news click here", "METADATA": {"description": "Commenting on the news that Aer Lingus is to review the viability of its services out of Shannon Airport, Shannon Chamber CEO Helen Downes said that \u201cit i...", "Keywords": "Limerick news,Shannon Airport", "news_keywords": "Limerick news,Shannon Airport", "sections": "Home,Business,News,SE Clare", "viewport": "width=1024,target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Warning that loss of London route at Shannon Airport would be \u2018incomprehensible\u2019", "description": "Commenting on the news that Aer Lingus is to review the viability of its services out of Shannon Airport, Shannon Chamber CEO Helen Downes said that \u201cit is incomprehensible that Shannon could lose its essential Heathrow slots\u201d.
