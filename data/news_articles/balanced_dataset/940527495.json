It took the intervention of Mvita Deputy County Commissioner Charles Monari to allow Ndeti\u2019s delegation to access the site.\n\n\"I'm the Chief Engineer of the project. Why was I not informed of this visit,\" asked the contractor. It was at this point that he was shoved aside to pave way for inspection of the project. \u201cNo one informed us of any plans of visiting to check (sic), you understand?\u201d he continued.\n\nOn her part, Ndeti said she was just across the road and there was no harm in inspecting the project since she is a Kenyan and an official in government. \"I'm Kenyan. A minister in this government. I can walk into any project. What are they hiding?\" she said.\n\nElsewhere, more than 70 police officers have been deployed to ensure smooth traffic flow as construction of the Sh62 billion Nairobi Expressway along Mombasa Road in Nairobi begins. 20 traffic police and 50 others from the Administration Police Service Critical Infrastructure Protection Unit have been deployed.\n\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta is scheduled to visit the site this weekend and an officer of the rank of commissioner will manage the team. Deputy Inspector General of APS Gabow Noor visited the sites where the construction team will be operating from and said the officers will enhance operations of the contractor and movement of motorists.\n\n\u201cWe are here to help the team do their job well. Motorists too should cooperate as this is a grand project that may affect their movements although for a short while,\u201d said Gabow. Nairobi traffic police boss Joshua Omukata said they have deployed enough personnel to ease traffic flow.\n\n\u201cWe have a senior officer managing the issue. We will make it,\u201d said Omukata. The excavators will be working day and night with police directing the removal of debris and arrival of materials. Main construction activities on the 27.1 Km project have started with the completion date set for December 2022.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "robots": "index,follow", "copyright": "The Standard Group PLC", "online": "online@standardmedia.co.ke", "author": "Vincent Kejitan", "source": "Standard Entertainment", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@sdekenya", "title": "Chinese man stops CAS Wavinya Ndeti from inspecting project", "description": "The Chief Engineer said he had not been informed of the visit prior", "creator": "@sdekenya", "image": "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/sdemedia/sdeimages/thursday/chinese_man_stops_ca5f35209c7ce98.jpg", "data1": "Vincent Kejitan", "label1": "author", "data2": "The Chief Engineer said he had not been informed of the visit prior", "label2": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 118898458656, "pages": 686823487999333}, "og": {"title": "Chinese man stops CAS Wavinya Ndeti from inspecting project", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/entertainment/news/2001382383/chinese-man-stops-cas-wavinya-ndeti-from-inspecting-project", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/sdemedia/sdeimages/thursday/chinese_man_stops_ca5f35209c7ce98.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/sdemedia/sdeimages/thursday/chinese_man_stops_ca5f35209c7ce98.jpg", "type": "image/jpg", "width": 800, "height": 500}, "locale": {"identifier": "en_GB", "alternate": "en_US"}, "description": "The Chief Engineer said he had not been informed of the visit prior", "site_name": "Standard Entertainment and Lifestyle"}, "developer": {"developer": "Dennis Kiptoo Kiptugen", "email": "dennis.kiptoo@programmer.net"}}}}
