They \u201cagreed to the full normalization of relations between Israel and the UAE,\u201d they said in a joint statement with the US that was released by President Donald Trump.\n\nSaid Trump: \u201cThis is a monumental step to forging ties of cooperation in the Middle East and I think you\u2019re going to have other countries come forward. I can tell you we already do and they want to make a deal. They\u2019re going to have peace in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nBahrain was among those welcoming the deal: \u201cThis historic step will contribute to strengthening stability and peace in the region,\u201d the government in Manama said in a statement on the national news agency.\n\nBahrain also said the accord stopped \u201cthe annexation of Palestinian lands and [was] advancing the region towards peace.\u201d\n\nThe UAE-Israel deal marks the third such agreement the Jewish state has struck with an Arab country after Egypt (1979) and Jordan (1994).\n\nIsraeli and UAE delegations will meet in the coming weeks to sign bilateral agreements regarding investment, tourism, direct flights, security and the establishment of reciprocal embassies, their statement said.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday night that Israel had entered \u201cnew era of Israeli relations with the Arab world,\u201d and that other deals with Arab countries would follow.\n\nHe said the agreement reflected the \u201cdramatic change\u201d in the way Israel was perceived in the region. In the past, it was regarded \u201cas an enemy and source of instability\u201d but today \u201cmany, many states see Israel as a strategic ally for stability, for security, for advancement and also for peace.\n\n\u201cThere will be other Arab and Muslim states that will join the circle of peace with us,\u201d he predicted. Israel and moderate states in the region \u201cstand aligned in favor of advancement and against the extremist forces that threaten us and world peace.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu said he has been working toward the goal of normalization with the Gulf since 2009.\n\n\u201cI always thought it was possible\u2026 I have been doing this constantly, for years,\u201d he said, noting his contacts with Oman, Sudan and other states in the area that don\u2019t have official ties with Israel.\n\nTrump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner said later Thursday that more Arab countries may soon announce normalized ties with Israel.\n\n\u201cWe hope this is an icebreaker where Israel can now normalize relations with other countries,\u201d Kushner said at a briefing with reporters, shortly after Trump announced the pact, adding that he thought there was a \u201cvery good chance\u201d of another Israeli-Arab deal within months.\n\nKushner said the administration had been in talks with other Arab states to normalize ties with Israel, too. He suggested that more announcements will come over the next few months.\n\n\u201cWe have a couple who were upset that they weren\u2019t first,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cBut\u2026 we will work very hard to create more and more normalizations over the coming time ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think that this makes them more inevitable,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut it will take trust being built and dialogue being facilitated. Hopefully, this makes it easier for others.\n\nAt one point, he was asked which other countries were in the mix. \u201cWho is next?\u201d Kushner asked back. \u201cYou will find out next.\u201d\n\nThe governments of Bahrain and Egypt, and a Saudi official, welcomed the agreement, while Jordan issued a more tepid response. The Palestinians reacted with fury to the deal, calling it \u201ca despicable betrayal.\u201d\n\nIsrael agreed to shelve annexation of parts of the West Bank as part of the deal, but it was unclear if the move had been put on hold permanently or temporarily. Netanyahu said his plan to apply Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria with full American coordination had not changed and was still on the table, but that Trump had requested a temporary halt.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=1024", "description": "Hours after UAE and Israel establish relations in deal announced by Trump, Hebrew media reports indicate Bahrain may follow soon", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/images/toi_icon_144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 123142304440875}, "og": {"url": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/senior-israeli-officials-reportedly-say-bahrain-next-in-line-for-normalization/", "type": "article", "title": "Israeli officials say Bahrain in advanced contacts to be next in line for ties", "description": "Hours after UAE and Israel establish relations in deal announced by Trump, Hebrew media reports indicate Bahrain may follow soon", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2019/07/D_xrt0PX4AUqonm-1024x640.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 640}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "timesofisrael", "title": "Israeli officials say Bahrain in advanced contacts to be next in line for ties", "description": "Hours after UAE and Israel establish relations in deal announced by Trump, Hebrew media reports indicate Bahrain may follow soon", "image": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2019/07/D_xrt0PX4AUqonm-1024x640.jpg"}}}}
