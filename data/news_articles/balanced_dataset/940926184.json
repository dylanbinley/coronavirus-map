Since the coronavirus pandemic, there has been much less freedom to move.\n\nAAP\n\nUltimately though, protesters want the asylum seekers released into the Brisbane community by Christmas.\n\n\"We could have them in houses in the community overnight,\" Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul told AAP.\n\nA number of the detainees have family members living in Brisbane, who they can only see from afar when their loved ones stand outside the hotel.\n\nMr Rintoul said there was a man who had been separated from his wife and child since 2017.\n\nVideos taken of the protest and posted on Facebook show a majority of participants wearing face masks.", "METADATA": {"apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "SBS News", "msapplication-TileColor": "#1b2024", "theme-color": "#1b2024", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Six protesters have been arrested during a rally outside the Kangaroo Point Hotel in Brisbane, where 120 asylum seekers are being detained.", "msvalidate.01": "0E549D3DACFFE4CFCA34DDAAA0180F04", "og": {"title": "Hundreds of refugee advocates rally outside Brisbane's Kangaroo Point Hotel", "description": "Six protesters have been arrested during a rally outside the Kangaroo Point Hotel in Brisbane, where 120 asylum seekers are being detained.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://sl.sbs.com.au/public/image/file/97bc9ff8-17d4-49c4-ae5e-9beadd21fe6d/crop/16x9", "type": "image/jpeg", "alt": "A protester (centre) is seen being detained by police during a rally in support of asylum seekers detained at the Kangaroo Point Central Hotel in Brisbane"}, "site_name": "SBS News", "url": "https://www.sbs.com.au/news/hundreds-of-refugee-advocates-rally-outside-brisbane-s-kangaroo-point-hotel", "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/sbsnews"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SBSNews", "title": "Hundreds of refugee advocates rally outside Brisbane's Kangaroo Point Hotel", "description": "Six protesters have been arrested during a rally outside the Kangaroo Point Hotel in Brisbane, where 120 asylum seekers are being detained.", "image": "https://sl.sbs.com.au/public/image/file/97bc9ff8-17d4-49c4-ae5e-9beadd21fe6d/crop/16x9", "url": "https://www.sbs.com.au/news/hundreds-of-refugee-advocates-rally-outside-brisbane-s-kangaroo-point-hotel"}, "fb": {"pages": "10153017026003686,1718340018404039,118110394871717,1031979170179611,156543917205,152749149157,1653992468195523,853308881454030,248358785343756,402145919880044,125982670754724,6038270901,240259225410,242485789418468,1735930699952878,108683457751,139727238426,91116257004,100246430019521,368329703192018,194784127232544,173168582700205,168993229831044"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=432849691, app-argument=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/hundreds-of-refugee-advocates-rally-outside-brisbane-s-kangaroo-point-hotel", "msapplication-TileImage": "/news/img/icons/icon-144x144.png", "robots": "Index,Follow"}}}
