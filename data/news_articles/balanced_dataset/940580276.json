Mediterranean", "TEXT": "Greece\u2019s prime minister has warmly thanked France for boosting its military presence in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nIt comes as Greek and Turkish warships are closely shadowing each other over a Turkish energy exploration bid in waters Athens claims as its own.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkey accused Greece and the island nation of Cyprus of encroaching on its rights in the Mediterranean.\n\nIt has vowed to defend its interests in the region but also called for dialogue to resolve the dispute.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has been hailed as a \u2018true friend of Greece\u2019 (Daniel Cole/AP)\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted that French President Emmanuel Macron is \u201ca true friend of Greece and also a fervent protector of European values and international law\u201d.\n\nThe mounting territorial tension follows Turkey\u2019s move to send a seismic research vessel, escorted by warships, into waters between the Greek island of Crete and Cyprus to look for potential offshore gas and oil reserves, following similar discoveries in other parts of the region.\n\nGreece claims part of the area is over its own continental shelf and has demanded the Turkish ships withdraw.\n\nTurkey has countered that it is entitled to conduct research in the area.\n\nGreece placed its military on alert and sent warships to the area off Turkey\u2019s southern coast.\n\nTurkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Greece of behaving maliciously (Turkish Presidency/AP)\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated a call for dialogue and said he would hold talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Council President Charles Michel later on Thursday to discuss the standoff.\n\n\u201cThe path for a solution in the eastern Mediterranean is dialogue and negotiation,\u201d he said during an address to his ruling party\u2019s officials.\n\n\u201cA formula based on a win-win solution that protects the rights of all can be found if we act with common sense and reason.\u201d\n\nMr Erdogan said \u201cGreece\u2019s attitude in the Aegean and the Mediterranean is malicious\u201d, adding that the Greek island on which Athens bases its continental shelf claim is located just 1.25 miles from the Turkish coast and 369 miles from the Greek mainland.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have designs on anyone\u2019s rights, but we won\u2019t let any country take away our rights.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish leader also accused France of \u201cprovoking\u201d Greece and Cyprus into taking \u201cwrongful steps.\u201d\n\nMr Erdogan later spoke on the phone with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has previously interceded to ease similar tensions between Turkey and Greece, and with EU Council President Charles Michel.\n\nMs Merkel also spoke on the phone with Mr Mitsotakis.\n\nA French Tonnerre helicopter carrier is escorted by Greek and French military vessels during a maritime exercise in the eastern Mediterranean (Greek National Defence/AP)\n\nThe Greek Defence Ministry said the French frigate Lafayette and the helicopter carrier Tonnerre held joint exercises with four Greek frigates Thursday in the eastern Mediterranean, including in areas Turkey is exploring.\n\nTwo French Rafale fighter jets are making a stop at Souda airbase in Crete on Thursday after being previously deployed in Cyprus for an exercise.\n\nThe French Defence Ministry said its presence \u201cis aiming at reinforcing France\u2019s autonomous assessment of the situation and affirms the country\u2019s attachment to free movement, maritime safety and respect for international law in the Mediterranean Sea\u201d.\n\nMr Macron announced after a phone call with Mr Mitsotakis late Wednesday that he decided to \u201ctemporarily reinforce the French military presence in the eastern Mediterranean in the coming days, in co-operation with European partners including Greece\u201d.", "METADATA": {"viewport":
