The TikTok order would take effect in September, but it remains unclear what it will mean for the apps' 100 million U.S. users, many of them teenagers or young adults who use it to post and watch short-form videos.\n\nIt's also unclear if it will make it illegal for TikTok to pay its roughly 1,500 workers in the U.S., which is why some of them came to Godwin for help, he said. The order would prohibit \u201cany transaction by any person\u201d with TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance.\n\n\u201cEmployees correctly recognize that their jobs are in danger and their payment is in danger right now,\u201d Godwin said.\n\nTikTok said in a statement last week that it was \u201cshocked by the recent Executive Order, which was issued without any due process.\u201d It declined to comment Thursday on whether it is pursuing its own lawsuit.\n\n\u201cWe have no involvement with and are not coordinating on\u201d the employee-led initiative, said TikTok spokeswoman Hilary McQuaide said via email. \"We respect the rights of employees to engage in concerted activity to seek due process of law.\u201d\n\nThe Fifth and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution safeguard life, liberty and property from arbitrary government action lacking \u201cdue process of law.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft is in talks to buy parts of TikTok, in a potential sale that\u2019s being forced under Trump\u2019s threat of a ban.\n\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended Trump\u2019s TikTok and WeChat orders Thursday, telling reporters he was exercising his emergency authority under a 1977 law enabling the president to regulate international commerce to address unusual threats.\n\n\u201cThe administration is committed to protecting the American people from all cyber threats and these apps collect significant amounts of private data on users,\u201d said McEnany, adding that the Chinese government can access and use such data.\n\nTikTok said it spent nearly a year trying to engage in \u201cgood faith\u201d with the U.S. government to address these concerns.\n\n\u201cWhat we encountered instead was that the Administration paid no attention to facts, dictated terms of an agreement without going through standard legal processes, and tried to insert itself into negotiations between private businesses,\u201d the company\u2019s statement said.\n\nGodwin said he was retained by Patrick Ryan, who joined TikTok from Google earlier this year as a technical program manager. Ryan posted a public fundraising pitch on GoFundMe this week to raise money for attorneys who can \u201cfight this unconstitutional taking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cAnd it\u2019s frankly really uncool.\u201d\n\nUnlike other Chinese tech companies targeted by Trump, such as telecom giant Huawei, TikTok's widespread popularity among Americans adds a layer of complexity to its legal and political challenges. The looming ban has annoyed TikTok users, some of them Trump supporters like Pam Graef of Metairie, Louisiana.\n\nThe 53-year-old fitness instructor found nearly instant TikTok fame after downloading the app this summer and posting a video of herself dancing frenetically in a kitchen as someone pretending to be her embarrassed daughter shouts that she's doing it wrong. The video has nearly 3.5 million views.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it to be banned. It\u2019s just a blast,\u201d Graef said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for me to promote my virtual training and virtual classes.\u201d\n\nShe said Trump won\u2019t lose her vote over this, but she doesn\u2019t understand all the fuss about the app\u2019s Chinese ownership. \u201cWhat are they gaining by spying on us?\u201d Graef said. \u201cWe\u2019re just doing stupid videos and having fun.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that, until late last year, the TikTok app was able to track users of Android phones without their consent by collecting unique phone identifiers in a way that skirted privacy safeguards set by Google. TikTok responded that the technique it used is a common way to prevent fraud and said it no longer collects the unique identifier.\n\nThe company has repeatedly said that the way it collects data is typical for thousands of mobile apps. \u201cWe have made clear that TikTok has never shared user data with the Chinese government, nor censored content at its request,\u201d said its statement last week.\n\nTrump's actions follow the lead of India, which has expressed similar security concerns and earlier this summer banned TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps amid a military standoff between the two countries.\n\nGodwin said the employees' legal challenge will be focused on worker rights, not on the national security claims underlying Trump's order.\n\nThe civil rights lawyer, known in early internet culture for coining \u201cGodwin's law,\u201d which posits that all online debates will eventually devolve into the use of Nazi analogies, said employees can't afford to wait.\n\n\u201cWe have to proceed very quickly,\u201d he said Thursday. \"If we wait around for the order to be enforced, which it will be on September 20, then the workers will lose their chances to be paid.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAamer Madhani contributed to this report from Washington.", "METADATA": {"format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "ispremium": 0, "dc.date": "2020-08-13T23:52:04Z", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T23:52:04Z", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T23:54:43Z", "opinion": "false"}, "SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "news_keywords": "Mike Godwin, Hilary McQuaide, Pam Graef, Kayleigh McEnany, Patrick Ryan, Aamer Madhani, United States, Chinese, North America, Fifth, India, Washington, Metairie, Louisiana, TikTok, AP, ByteDance, California State News, MC Complete -
