"Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman said on Thursday that the recently-passed FATF-related bills are against the country\u2019s sovereignty and prove of the PTI-led government\u2019s diplomatic failure.\n\n\u201cWe are being told that the country has been rescued from being black listed but in reality our independence has been put at stake,\u201d he said while briefing the media about his party\u2019s parliamentary meeting held on Wednesday.\n\nIn a rare display of unity on a matter of national interest, the government and most opposition parties on Wednesday came together to pass the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Bill, 2020 with a majority vote \u2013 another legislation that is crucial for the country\u2019s removal from global watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list.\n\nThe bill proposes prohibiting the provision of loans or financial assistance to those associated with banned organisations and restricting all banks and financial institutions from issuing credit cards to individuals on the proscribed persons list.\n\nNational Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser did not invite JUI-F for consultation over these bills like other opposition parties, said Fazl.\n\nNA passes amended anti-terror law bill\n\n\u201cThis incompetent government has bowed down to the international establishment and passed the bills under their pressure,\u201d said JUI-F maintaining that such laws are part of international conspiracy against Pakistan.\n\nLashing out at the governemnt\u2019s diplomatic conduct, Fazl said Pakistan has failed to effectively take up Kashmir issue and India\u2019s involvement in Balochistan at international fora.\n\n\u201cWhile Indian is among the country which pressurised Pakistan to pass the bills, we have even failed to highlight Indian atrocities against the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).\u201d\n\nHe said never ever in the past such bills were passed by the government under international pressure. \u201cWe were compelled to do so because this incompotent rulers have desroyed our economy.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width",
