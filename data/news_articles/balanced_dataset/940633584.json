He was 68.\n\nPolice investigators said he had fallen into a crevasse in the ice and drowned in the deep water below.\n\nA fellow scientist at the station, Jason Box, said the crevasse, or large crack, was a known hazard. But he added that high winds and recent snowfall had made visibility poor and landmarks harder to spot.\n\nThe small group at the site \u2014 christened Swiss Camp by Dr. Steffen \u2014 was installing new equipment when he walked off to perform another task. Over the next few hours, Dr. Box said, they assumed that Dr. Steffen had gone back to his tent for a nap. But when they finished their work he was nowhere to be found.", "METADATA": {"article": {"published": "2020-08-13T21:42:51.000Z", "modified": "2020-08-14T09:34:14.000Z", "section": "Climate", "tag": "Steffen, Konrad", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000007285335, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/f3d85db0-01b1-56fa-9da7-7029dcd87c41", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/cfae29ce86c94362ad166914696486f8", "description": "A renowned researcher on rising sea levels, he died after falling into the kind of crevasse that warming has created. \u201cIt looks like climate change actually claimed him as a victim,\u201d a colleague said.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/14/obituaries/12Steffen-print/12Steffen-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By John Schwartz", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/14/obituaries/12Steffen-print/12Steffen-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Obituary,Climate Change,Global Warming,Science and Technology,Greenland,Konrad Steffen", "pdate": 20200813, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/climate/konrad-steffen-dead.html", "type": "article", "title": "Konrad Steffen, Who Sounded Alarm on Greenland Ice, Dies at 68", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/14/obituaries/12Steffen-print/12Steffen-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Konrad Steffen in 2010.
