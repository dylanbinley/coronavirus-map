It said the tankers were en route to Venezuela.\n\nThe report, however, was rejected by Venezuelan and Iranian officials. Iran\u2019s Ambassador to Venezuela Hojat Soltani called the report \u2018a lie\u2019 and \u2018psychological warfare\u2019 from the US propaganda machine. In his Twitter post, Soltani said neither the ships nor the owners are Iranian.\n\nSenior Venezuelan officials have also decried Washington\u2019s threats against Tehran and Caracas. Venezuela\u2019s opposition members, however, say they support any US action against Iran\u2019s fuel shipments to the Latin American country. But political experts describe Washington\u2019s pressure on Tehran and Caracas as illegal and futile.\n\nThe US is waging a propaganda war with economic sanctions against Venezuela and Iran. However, the officials in Tehran and Caracas stress that they will continue their cooperation in the face of the White House\u2019s bullying attitude.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "og": {"site_name": "PressTV", "title": "Iran, Venezuela joining hands against US bullying", "type": "video", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The US is waging a propaganda war with economic sanctions against Venezuela and Iran.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.presstv.com/Photo/2020/8/15/7ffaf4ae-2783-4630-8d40-092c57da967f.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn.presstv.com/Photo/2020/8/15/7ffaf4ae-2783-4630-8d40-092c57da967f.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 360, "type": "image/jpg"}, "video": {"identifier": "https://video.presstv.com/vod/_definst_/smil:path1//ptv/newsroom/20200815/caracas_jsr.smil/playlist.m3u8", "url": "https://video.presstv.com/vod/_definst_/smil:path1//ptv/newsroom/20200815/caracas_jsr.smil/playlist.m3u8", "secure_url": "https://video.presstv.com/vod/_definst_/smil:path1//ptv/newsroom/20200815/caracas_jsr.smil/playlist.m3u8", "type": "video/mp4", "width": 640, "height": 360}}, "title": "Iran, Venezuela joining hands against US bullying", "description": "Press TV is an Iranian state-controlled news and documentary network that broadcasts in the English and French-language.
