That is the information we have.\n\n\u201cBut as I said, Investigation will continue to find out what might be the cause of that accident whether he might fall asleep or someone hit him. I have no information but the investigation will determine what causes the accident,\u201d he added.\n\nBy IAN M.KAUKUI", "METADATA": {"keywords": "national, news", "title": "MP PROBED\u00a0OVER ACCIDENT", "author": "Editor", "og": {"url": "http://www.solomonstarnews.com/index.php/news/national/item/23950-mp-probed-over-accident", "title": "MP PROBED\u00a0OVER ACCIDENT - Solomon Star News", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.solomonstarnews.com/media/k2/items/cache/068d043852ad35bb065e98284fe5e557_M.jpg", "description": "Solomon Star National News"}, "image": "http://www.solomonstarnews.com/media/k2/items/cache/068d043852ad35bb065e98284fe5e557_M.jpg", "description": "Solomon Star National News", "generator": "SmartAddons.Com - the high quality products!", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "YES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
