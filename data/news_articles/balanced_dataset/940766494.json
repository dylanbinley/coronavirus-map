The public health official claimed the evidence that face coverings stop the virus\u2019s spread is \u201castonishingly weak\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe findings that have been produced through [the use of] facemasks are astonishingly weak, even though so many people around the world wear them,\u201d Dr Tegnell told German tabloid Bild, in comments reported by The Times on Monday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised that we don\u2019t have more or better studies showing what effect masks actually have. Countries such as Spain and Belgium have made their populations wear masks, but their infection numbers have still risen. The belief that masks can solve our problem is in any case very dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\nBoris Govt Admits 50 Million Masks It Purchased Are Unusable https://t.co/bGQNPFpaby \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 6, 2020\n\nEarlier this year, British police forces had come under criticism for their draconian handling of lockdown measures, resulting in the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) calling for all coronavirus lockdown-related convictions to be reviewed.\n\nWhile Britons were effectively under house arrest, the United Kingdom\u2019s external borders remained open to legal migration for months \u2014 a decision recently criticised by a committee of MPs who said it resulted in an extra 10,000 infections entering the country.\n\nMeanwhile, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has reported for months on the unchallenged flow of thousands of illegal aliens across the English Channel on small boats, from migrant camps rife with the virus.\n\nThere were also instances of pro-freedom, anti-lockdown demonstrators being arrested in London while Marxist Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters gathered en masse without being challenged under lockdown rules which made them unlawful.\n\nFarage Investigates \u2018Lawless Britain\u2019: Media \u2018Too Scared\u2019 to Report on London Thugs Rioting in Small Seaside Town https://t.co/0sixPYB5r2 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 13, 2020\n\nThere have been reports of hundreds of illegal pop-up raves across the country, and several \u2014 in the mainstream media\u2019s words \u2014 \u201cstreet parties\u201d in parts of London that descended into violence, resulting in police officers being attacked and injured.\n\nIn one astounding case of a mass illegal gathering last week, 3,000 to 5,000 south Londoners descended on the small seaside town of Greatstone in Kent, some 75 miles away, for an event marking Jamaican Independence Day, rioting, taking drugs, and leaving rubbish and human waste strewn across the beach and even in people\u2019s private properties.\n\nUnder coronavirus measures, gatherings of more than 30 people are banned. The prime minister also announced on Thursday that organisers of \u201cunlawful gatherings\u201d will face fines, with The Times reporting it could up to \u00a310,000.\n\nHowever, it may be difficult for police to ascertain the organisers of such events like the London \u201cstreet parties\u201d, and rave organisers have decades\u2019 experience evading authorities.\n\nCoronafun: Music Fans Isolated in Pens at UK\u2019s First \u2018Socially Distanced\u2019 Gig https://t.co/GWBf7K53u7 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 14, 2020\n\nThe new fines were announced as Boris Johnson\u2019s Cabinet at short notice signed off on an enforced quarantine of holidaymakers returning from France. Around a half a million Britons currently travelling in France will have to self-isolate for a fortnight on their return.\n\nThose returning from Monaco, Malta, the Netherlands, Aruba, and the Turks and Caicos Islands will also be subject to quarantine.\n\nTravellers will have only until 4 a.m. on Saturday to return before the measures take effect.
