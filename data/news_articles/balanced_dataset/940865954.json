positive", "TEXT": "KUALA LUMPUR: A total of 10,838 people have returned to Malaysia since July 24, out of whom 44 were infected with the coronavirus.\n\nSenior Minister (Security) Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob (pic) said these returnees were placed at 60 hotels and five public training institutes.\n\n\u201cThose who tested positive for Covid-19 have been sent to hospital.\n\n\u201cSo far, 2,992 people have been allowed to go home from quarantine centres.\n\n\u201cThey returned from 31 countries, including the Philippines, France, Australia and Japan, \u201d he said in a statement yesterday.\n\nIncoming travellers into Malaysia must undergo mandatory quarantine at designated centres starting July 24.\n\nThis came about after the government scrapped a move, which started on June 10, to allow those who tested negative upon arrival in Malaysia to undergo self-quarantine at home.\n\nIsmail Sabri also said that a group of people was stranded at the KL International Airport (KLIA) on Thursday as they were not sent to the quarantine centres within the stipulated time.\n\n\u201cOf the 13 flights that landed at KLIA, one of the flights, carrying 104 passengers, was not scheduled to do so.\n\n\u201cTheir departure for the quarantine centres was delayed as the hotels were still preparing for such a big group.\n\n\u201cThe secretariat has taken prompt action to send them in small groups to existing hotels, \u201d Ismail Sabri said.\n\nHe said the last group was placed at quarantine centres at 10pm.\n\nOn the enforcement front, 44 people were arrested on Thursday while 159 others were issued with compounds for violating the recovery movement control order (MCO), said the minister.\n\n\u201cAmong the offences included going to pubs and night clubs, failure to prepare temperature checks and entry registration and activities that hampered physical distancing.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the compliance operation task force carried out 64,875 inspections nationwide on Thursday, including 3,900 supermarkets, 5,452 restaurants, 3,703 banks and 983 government buildings.\n\nOn Ops Benteng, he said the authorities had tightened security at the country\u2019s borders and secret passages to prevent the entry of illegal immigrants.\n\nIsmail Sabri said 9,610 public sanitisation operations had been conducted nationwide since March 30.\n\n\u201cA total of 12,838 premises were sanitised, including 5,644 government buildings and 1,594 housing estates.\u201d", "METADATA": {"ROBOTS": "index,follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "KUALA
