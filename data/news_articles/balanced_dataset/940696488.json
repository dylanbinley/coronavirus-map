It has been suggested the only way to protect our waters from illegal fishing is to ask other European navies to send over ships to check their own trawlers.\n\nBritain has ordered five new naval vessels designed for fishery protection patrols \u2013 three of which are already operational.\n\nBy contrast, the Naval Service had to tie up two ships 14 months ago due to lack of crews and a further two look likely to follow suit before the end of the year.\n\nPatrick Murphy, chief executive of the Irish South & West Fish Producers' Organisation, said the richest fishing grounds off the continent are in Britain and Ireland.\n\nMr Murphy expects \u201can onslaught\u201d of EU vessels to enter our waters if the British closes her seas off to foreign trawlers next January.\n\nRead More West Cork flooding forces elderly residents to leave their homes\n\n\u201cIf you put all the players onto the pitch at the one time what's going to happen to the grass? You will destroy it.\u201d\n\nMr Murphy pointed out that the waters off our coasts are some of the richest spawning grounds anywhere in the world and overfishing will not just kill their productivity for Irish boats but will ultimately \u201cdestroy the ecological system for everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Naval Service has been depleted because the Government is not giving it the resources it needs. I feel for them because they are doing a fantastic job. My biggest fear (in relation to fisheries protection) is the depletion of the navy.\n\n\"We don't see them as the bad guys, we see them as our friends and we need them out there in numbers.\"\n\nHe described it \u201cas absolute madness\u201d that as an island nation, with a sea mass 10-times our landmass, we have allowed the naval service to run down to such an extent.\n\nMr Murphy also pointed out the naval service has rescued many fishermen in distress over the years and helped to recover the bodies of people who weren't so lucky.\n\nCork South-West Independent TD Michael Collins said he was also very worried at the prospect of Irish seas being overfished by other nations as a result of Brexit, especially as the naval service is so understrength.\n\n\u201cWe won't be able to adequately patrol these waters with the small number of vessels we'll have. I think maybe it's time that we asked our EU colleagues to send ships over here to police their own fishermen,\u201d Mr Collins said.", "METADATA": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "pragma": "no-cache", "cache-control": "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0, proxy-revalidate", "generator": "redFACT7 CMS, powered by www.newsfactory.de", "keywords": "News, court and crime, politics and analysis", "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "EU-registered fishing vessels could be prevented from entering British seas in the event of a hard Brexit", "news_keywords": "News, court and crime, politics and analysis,Sean O\u2019Riordan", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/3848/1924172_8_org_1H7A5598_1_.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 325}, "url": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-40032173.html", "title": "Irish waters could be overrun by EU fishing vessels, says fishing organisation", "site_name": "Irish Examiner", "description": "EU-registered fishing vessels could be prevented from entering British seas in the event of a hard Brexit"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T06:00:00+01:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/irishexaminer", "section": "IE-Main/NEWS", "tag": "IE-Main/NEWS"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/3848/1924172_8_org_1H7A5598_1_.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@irishexaminer", "title": "Irish waters could be overrun by EU fishing vessels, says fishing organisation", "description": "EU-registered fishing vessels could be prevented from entering British seas in the event of a hard Brexit", "domain": "irishexaminer.com", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "Irish Examiner", "ipad": "Irish Examiner", "googleplay": "Irish Examiner"}, "id": {"iphone": 662222158, "ipad": 662222158, "googleplay": "ie.irishexaminer.mobile"}}, "url": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-40032173.html"}, "language": "en"}}}
