' COVID-19 has brought immense challenges to the Meals on Wheels service, making it difficult for the team to not only deliver the meals, but also to collect the donations which are so badly needed to keep this essential service operating.\n\n'Bus \u00c9ireann carry over two million passengers in the North East every year, if even a small portion of these people come out to donate, we will succeed in this challenge.'\n\nMeals on Wheels have been running since 1972 in Dundalk and support over 80 people in the locality every day.\n\nThey suggest bringing non-perishable goods for donation to 'Fill the Bus' such as: tea, coffee, powdered custard, tins of fruit, creamed rice, gravy granules, stock cubes, cooking oil as well as useful household products such as tin foil, Brillo pads, washing up liquid, disinfectant spray and disposable gloves.\n\n'Bus \u00c9ireann connects people to who and what matters to them and we see this campaign as an extension of this connection within our community here in Dundalk,' continued Michael Colleran, 'Together with our media partner LMFM we are asking you to please come and join us in the Bus \u00c9ireann station and help us 'Fill a Bus' for those in need.'\n\n'We would like to thank Bus \u00c9ireann for partnering with us on this campaign,' said John Hennessy of Meals on Wheels, Dundalk. 'These vital donations will be going directly to the people who need them and we are continually grateful to the people of Dundalk, supporting the most vulnerable in our society.'\n\nThe Argus", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover", "description": "Bus \u00c9ireann, Ireland's national bus company is joining with Meals on Wheels Dundalk in appealing for contributions for the vulnerable, elderly and housebound in the area.", "fb": {"pages": 96796398469, "app_id": 714861305308164}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=335158729, app-argument=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/argus/news/fill-the-bus-for-meals-on-wheels-39438080.html", "og": {"title": "Fill the bus for Meals on Wheels", "site_name": "independent", "description": "Bus \u00c9ireann, Ireland's national bus company is joining with Meals on Wheels Dundalk in appealing for contributions for the vulnerable, elderly and housebound in the area.", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/regionals/argus/news/fill-the-bus-for-meals-on-wheels-39438080.html", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.independent.ie/regionals/argus/news/32e94/39438079.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/2020-08-11_the_61088860_I1.JPG", "secure_url": "https://www.independent.ie/regionals/argus/news/32e94/39438079.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/2020-08-11_the_61088860_I1.JPG", "type": "image/png", "width": 1240, "height": 700}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Independent_ie", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/regionals/argus/news/fill-the-bus-for-meals-on-wheels-39438080.html", "title": "Fill the bus for Meals on Wheels", "description": "Bus \u00c9ireann, Ireland's national bus company is joining with Meals on Wheels Dundalk in appealing for contributions for the vulnerable, elderly and housebound in the area.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.independent.ie/regionals/argus/news/32e94/39438079.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/2020-08-11_the_61088860_I1.JPG", "alt": "John Hennessy"}, "domain": "Independent.ie"}}}}
