reported", "TEXT": "MANILA (AFP, REUTERS) \u2013 The Philippines delayed on Friday (Aug 14) the start of the school year by another six weeks to October as the country battles surging coronavirus infections and prepares to turn classrooms into quarantine facilities.\n\nSchools across the archipelago have been shut since mid-March when President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s government imposed a months-long lockdown in a bid to slow the fast-spreading contagion.\n\nThe academic year usually starts in June but was pushed back to Aug 24.\n\nIt is now scheduled to begin on Oct 5, the education department said, blaming the latest lockdown in the capital Manila and four surrounding provinces for \u201clogistical limitations\u201d in preparing for remote schooling.\n\nThe authorities have largely ruled out face-to-face classes for the rest of 2020 after Mr Duterte said students would have to stay home until a virus vaccine is available.\n\nThe Philippines is due to start large-scale human testing of a Russian vaccine in October, with regulatory approval of the drug expected in April next year, according to the government\u2019s timeline released on Thursday.\n\nIn the meantime, more than 20 million students enrolled for the new school year will do \u201cblended learning\u201d that involves a mix of online, television and radio classes.\n\nBut preparations have been plagued by problems and there are concerns that many children from poor families with no or limited Internet access will be disadvantaged.\n\nEducation Secretary Leonor Briones urged parents to use online modules provided by the government to home-school their children during the extended break.\n\n\u201cIt is to your advantage if you already start teaching your own children,\u201d Dr Briones said. \u201cWe will be more than ready by October.\u201d\n\nBut there was uproar on social media this week after some of the modules were found to be littered with grammar errors.\n\nThe education department blamed an encoding glitch.\n\nRelated Story Duterte to skip Philippine trial of Russia virus vaccine\n\nHalf of the classrooms in Manila \u2013 nearly 18,000 \u2013 have been made available to the health department to use as isolation centres for Covid-19 patients, Dr Briones said on Thursday.\n\nIt comes as the authorities force people who have tested positive for the virus and cannot self-isolate at home to stay in government-run facilities to slow community transmission of the illness.\n\nThe Philippines' health ministry on Friday reported 6,216 more novel coronavirus infections, the third-largest daily increase recorded in South-east Asia up to now, and 16 additional deaths.\n\nIn a bulletin, the ministry said the total number of confirmed cases had increased to 153,660, while confirmed deaths had reached 2,442.\n\nThe Philippines on Monday reported its highest daily rise in confirmed infections at 6,958.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,
