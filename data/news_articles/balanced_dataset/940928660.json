Here are some of the stories changing how the public sees the state. \u2014 Meduza", "TEXT": "Vardan Grigoryan, detained during a protest, at a temporary detention facility Natalia Fedosenko / TASS / Scanpix / LETA\n\nProtests have swept Belarus since a contested presidential election on August 9. In the initial police crackdown, nearly 7,000 people were arrested. Those thrown behind bars weren\u2019t all hardened activists or even participants in the rallies \u2014 the authorities swept up journalists, foreigners, and even random passersby. Many of these people are still missing in the bureaucratic mayhem that\u2019s followed. Officials have not disclosed many detainees\u2019 whereabouts to family members, human rights groups, and individuals\u2019 own lawyers. Prisoners lucky enough to have been released talk of brutal conditions: overcrowded cells, inadequate food, and torture. Meduza special correspondent Kristina Safonova spoke to some of these people to find out more about the conditions in Belarusian jails.\n\n\u201cThe system broke down and failed\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere they\u2019re keeping [detainees] is a big question. We ourselves don\u2019t know exactly where they\u2019re being taken,\u201d says Valentin Stefanovich, a member of the \u201cVesya\u201d human rights group. \u201cThe Interior Ministry\u2019s system turned out to be absolutely unprepared for this volume of arrests.\u201d\n\nIn four days of protests, beginning on August 9 in the immediate aftermath of the presidential election, police across Belarus arrested nearly 7,000 people at opposition rallies. The biggest crackdowns were in the capital. Vesna\u2019s Stefanovich told Meduza that jails made space ahead of the election, in preparation for mass arrests. Prisoners being held on misdemeanor charges were released and other inmates were moved to facilities outside Minsk. Meduza heard similar accounts from Valdis Fugash, a representative from \u201cHuman Constanta,\u201d another human rights organization that works in Belarus.\n\nThese efforts weren\u2019t enough. Minsk\u2019s police stations, its jails, and the Okrestina detention center are now all over capacity.\n\n\u201cIn the Okrestina complex, as we\u2019ve heard from people who were released, there are 30, 40, 50, even 60 people in cells meant for between four and eight people,\u201d says Fugash. When protests entered their second night on August 10, many detainees were transferred about an hour away to a jail in Zhodino, but this facility, too, was soon overcrowded, forcing the authorities to move people to the local prison, Fugash says.\n\nEven relatives have found it impossible to learn the whereabouts of individual detainees. Officially, the Interior Ministry does not divulge such information. \u201cIf one of your acquaintances, friends, or colleagues has disappeared, it\u2019s exceedingly difficult to find them,\u201d says Fugash. \u201cMany still can\u2019t find people who vanished on the night of August 9. Imagine it \u2014 four days have passed. They come to the police station, they ask questions. Some file formal requests for information. Occasionally, there\u2019s a response and you find out that someone is being held at this or that jail in or Zhodino, but that\u2019s a rare exception.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s relatives and volunteers who usually keep Vesna and Human Constanta informed about what happened to particular detainees. For instance, there are Telegram chat rooms where people share the names of protestors who disappeared, but human rights activists have no access to the Interior Ministry\u2019s records.\n\nTracking down detainees is even more difficult now because they\u2019re tried behind closed doors in courts literally housed inside detention centers. \u201cBefore, people were arrested in the evening and taken to court in the morning for a fine or some jail time. We could monitor that,\u201d explains Fugash. \u201c[Now] judges travel to the jails and hold their trials there. Defendants say their cases were over in a couple of minutes. [The authorities] totally refused to hear any defense.\u201d\n\nA crowd waits outside the jail in Zhodino, August 13, 2020 Tatiana Zenkovich / EPA / Scanpix / LETA\n\nAccording to Valentin Stefanovich, most people tried in these hearings are sentenced to between 15 and 25 days in jail.\n\nEven under these accelerated procedures, however, the courts couldn\u2019t keep up, says Stefanovich. In Minsk and Zhodino, on August 12, they started releasing people who\u2019d been locked up for more than 72 hours without formal charges. Admittedly, Belarusian law allows the justice system to bring them back before a judge anytime within the next two months.\n\nIn fact, the authorities have started releasing even the detainees sentenced to jail because there\u2019s nowhere left to put them. Human rights groups caution that this is not a cause for celebration because the law dictates that these administrative sentences can be enforced at any point in the next year.\n\nLess fortunate detainees have been transferred to full-fledged penitentiaries to serve their jail sentences. Human rights activists have recorded such cases, for example, at a high security prison in Ivacevichi, outside Brest. All this suggests that \u201cthe system broke down and failed,\u201d argues Stefanovich.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll teach you how to vote\u201d\n\nNews about protesters\u2019 detainment conditions trickled in overnight on Monday, August 10, as several Russian journalists were also released. One of these reporters was Daily Storm correspondent Anton Starkov, who was arrested with his colleague, Dmitry Lasenko, on the first night of protests in downtown Minsk. Prior to this, journalists witnessed riot police beating Meduza special correspondent Maxim Solopov and throwing him into a police van. This attack was captured on video.\n\nStarkov and Lasenko spent 24 hours in the Okrestina jail. Immediately after leaving, Starkov told Meduza that he had been denied food and drinking water for that entire time. Once back in Russia, Starkov reported that he spent the night after his arrest in an outdoor jail yard. His phone and personal effects were taken only in the morning, when he was transferred to a cell with a capacity of four. He shared the space with 15 other people.\n\n\u201cWhen we just arrived, they were a bit rough with us. We got out of the police van and were forced down a hallway full of guards. I managed to get through unscathed,\u201d says the journalist. \u201cWhen they took us to the first cell, I started shouting that I was a Russian citizen and demanded that they call the ambassador. I heard back: \u2018You\u2019re from where? We\u2019re gonna fuck you up.\u2019\u201d\n\nBelarusians were treated even worse: \u201cThe entire night we spent in the open-air cell, we heard beatings and torture. The local guards conducted \u2018educational work\u2019 with the detainees. We heard, \u2018You will not protest again!\u2019 and then the sound of a smack. \u2018You will not come near the police again!\u2019 \u2014 another smack,\u201d remembers Starkov. \u201cThey forced them to crawl on their knees around the prison yard for what seemed like forever. We heard the guards roar, \u201cOn your knees! Lower!\u201d Judging by how loud the smacks were, nobody was pulling his punches. When the guards got tired, they told us, \u201cIf anyone asks, no one even touched you here.\u201d\n\nAnother journalist named Stanislav Ivashkevich also heard the cries and the beatings. A Belarusian citizen, he recently authored an investigative report about the role women have played in President Lukashenko\u2019s life. Speaking to Meduza, Ivashkevich said he was subjected to violence only once while arrested, on the second day in custody, when he and his cellmates were brought outside and forced \u201cthrough the gauntlet.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s when several dozen cops stand on both sides and beat everyone passing through with sticks,\u201d he explained.\n\nAudio recorded outside a prison in Belarus laplanddream\n\nThe guards were relatively \u201ctactful\u201d for the first day, says Ivashkevich, but it was evident by day two that they\u2019d undergone some kind of \u201cideological brainwashing,\u201d he says. \u201cThey repeated clearly rehearsed phrases: \u2018Well how did you treat us yesterday?\u2019 \u2018We\u2019re stuck with a second shift because of you and we missed our dinner,\u2019 as they hit people coming through the gauntlet. The farther you went, the angrier they became.\u201d\n\nIvashkevich spent two days at the Okrestina facility, all the while with a dozen other detainees crammed into a cell meant for three people: \u201cInitially, we took turns sleeping, with two people squeezing onto the cot. Those who couldn\u2019t wait their turn slept on the floor. If someone got a bit of rest, they hopped off and let someone else lie down, even if it was still their turn. Eventually, though, we all just slept on the cot, piled on top of each other. In two days, they fed us only once \u2014 a loaf of bread. Everyone there was very dignified, so no one took the last piece.\u201d\n\nDespite the fact that police arrested Ivashkevich before Sunday\u2019s protests even began (while he was conducting an interview near a polling place), a judge convicted him of joining an unlawful assembly and slapped him with a fine of 30 \u201cbasic units\u201d \u2014 about $325. Nevertheless, Ivashkevich was released (along with only three other detainees in his group). \u201cI suspect the judge decided to release me because I have a dependent child. But the fact that I\u2019m a journalist didn\u2019t affect the verdict,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen Ivashkevich went free, he didn\u2019t get back his personal effects, phone, or wallet. \u201cThey took me a few miles away from the Okrestina complex and dropped me off there. I had to make my own way home. They did it that way on purpose because several hundred relatives and supporters were camped outside the jail. They released the detainees where the crowd couldn\u2019t see, to avoid boosting their morale,\u201d he explains.\n\nAnother man arrested in Minsk, whom we\u2019ll call \u201cPavel,\u201d told Meduza that he, too, never got his things back after being released. Pavel spent more than two days at Okrestina. He says he was arrested late on August 9 while waiting with a friend for the bus.\n\nOfficers first brought him to the Oktyabrskoye police station, where he was charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct. Next, he moved to the Okrestina facility. \u201cThey started to pressure us as soon as we arrived. It was maximum demoralization. They scream at you, swear in all sorts of ways, and try to dominate you physically. \u2018Hands on the wall! Hands behind your back!\u2019 They might hit you under the knees if they see you\u2019re \u2018not spreadin\u2019 \u2018em\u2019 wide enough.\u201d\n\nThe first night, Pavel and seven other detainees shared a cell with four cots. They weren\u2019t fed. The second night, they were corralled into a hallway to sign new charges that contradicted the paperwork filed originally at the police station. Pavel\u2019s crime was no longer just disorderly conduct \u2014 now he\u2019d participated in an unlawful assembly. \u201c[The cops] weren\u2019t hitting me, but they forcefully tapped my shoulder and shoved my neck. They told me: \u2018Come on, sign it! If I have to stay here a third night because of you, you\u2019ll regret it!\u2019\u201d Pavel recalls. \u201cSome signed it, some didn\u2019t. I was ready to do anything just to get out.\u201d\n\nAfterward, Pavel was taken to a different cell where there were about 40 people for six cots. People had to sleep anywhere they could reach, including under the beds. \u201cWe decided to have two people squeeze onto a cot. You couldn\u2019t fit two people under the bed \u2014 only about one and a half. Everyone else had to figure something else out. We gave our sheets to people on the floor so they\u2019d have something to sleep on. I managed to win myself a pillow but I shared it, as well. After all, we\u2019re all human and we all want rest,\u201d Pavel told Meduza.\n\nHe says one of the detainees demanded that his injuries caused by the guards be documented. At first, they ignored his pleas, but then they flung open the cell door and tried to drench the yelling man with a bucket of water. He managed to dodge it.\n\nA date was never set for Pavel\u2019s hearing. Early on August 12, prison guards removed him and eight others from the cell and began to beat them with batons. \u201cYou won\u2019t go to protests again! I\u2019ll remember you!\u201d they shouted as they swung.\n\n\u201cIt reminded me of a whack-a-mole machine,\u201d says Pavel. \u201cEach guard beats whomever he sees, without picking a particular victim. They know how to hit you so that they don\u2019t break anything, but so it still hurts like hell after. I was mostly beaten on the thighs. Those who screamed the most got beaten the most. They want to beat even more suffering out of you, to humiliate you as much as possible in that moment. I was patient, so I kept quiet.\u201d\n\nThen the detainees were forced up against a wall and made to wait their turn to be freed. Pavel says the guards giggled and joked that they were \u201carranging [the detainees] for execution.\u201d\n\nThe thing that surprised Pavel most of all, he says, is how many women he saw at the Okrestina detention facility. They were kept separate from the men, but he could hear their voices through his cell, he says. According to a student who spoke to Tut.by, whom we\u2019ll call \u201cKarina,\u201d the women in custody weren\u2019t even provided toilet paper, let alone food. \u201cWe\u2019ll teach you how to vote!\u201d the guards yelled at them.\n\n\u201cLike hell on earth\u201d\n\n\u201cSo many people are lying limp! They\u2019re being beaten and tortured,\u201d cries a woman\u2019s voice from behind the camera. The video, recorded from a nearby apartment building, shows the courtyard behind the Oktyabrskaya police station. Prisoners are lying literally on top of one another, their hands behind their backs. Armed guards clad in black uniforms stand over them. It\u2019s not clear what to which branch of law enforcement they belong. Other footage from the area shows how the officers take detainees out of the building, force them onto their knees, and beat them with batons.\n\n\u201c[We] were thrown against the wall with our legs shoulder-width apart and with our hands above our head. They kept bringing more people. Many of us stood like that from 2 in the morning until 2 in the afternoon. We were given two or three bottles of water to share between 40, maybe 60, people,\u201d one of the detainees at the Sovietsky police station recalled in an interview to VotTak. He said some people got sick as the sun rose: \u201cPeople \u2018turned off,\u2019 they fainted, and they even called an ambulance for one of them and took him away. It looked like hell on Earth. Utter hell,\u201d he said.\n\nRead another eyewitness account from these jails \u2018Just shoot us already\u2019 Arrested during protests in Minsk and jailed for two days, a Russian journalist describes the carnage of Belarusian incarceration\n\n\u201cIf I end up there again, I\u2019ll never get out\u201d\n\nViolence against detainees has been commonplace not just in Minsk but nationwide, says human rights activist Valdias Fugash. Police stations and jails everywhere in Belarus are running out of room.\n\n\u201cI can tell you about Mogilev, where our colleagues have compiled a list of about 250 names. That many administrative arrests in Mogilev is simply unimaginable. There are reports that the lack of space has led the authorities to transfer detainees to smaller towns outside the city,\u201d says Furgash.\n\nLike in Minsk, it remains unclear which arm of law enforcement at the jails is tasked with managing all these new inmates. Usually, these are people in black uniforms and balaclavas without any insignia. Furgash says these same security forces, clad in black, have been ubiquitous on the streets of Belarusian cities during the unrest.\n\n\u201cAccording to detainees released from jail, the bulk of these forces are OMON [riot police]. At the same time, though, there are many ordinary cops who are dressed in all black,\u201d explains Furgash. \u201cExactly who is operating the jails is difficult to determine right now. People are still in shock; some of them have been hospitalized. I reckon the people responsible for the violence also aren\u2019t wearing any insignia.\u201d\n\nValentin Stefanovich from the \u201cVesna\u201d group also suspects the Interior Ministry personnel who regularly run the jails are \u201cno longer playing any role\u201d at these facilities, citing information that special units have been rotated into their old roles.\n\nA woman from Brest whom we\u2019ll call \u201cYekaterina\u201d says she still has no idea who arrested her 14-year-old son, whom we\u2019ll call \u201cAlexey.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s terrified \u2014 he doesn\u2019t even want to go to the doctor because he\u2019s afraid of everything. He tells me about what happened as much as he can. I just listen.\u201d\n\nOn the evening of August 11, Alexey never returned home from a tutoring lesson. As early at 8 p.m., his mother began to worry. It was the third night of protests and she\u2019d agreed with her son that he wouldn\u2019t stay out late.\n\n\u201cAt 8:30 p.m., my husband drove out to look for him. There weren\u2019t any demonstrations downtown,\u201d says Yekaterina. Alexey\u2019s father later worked up the courage to approach the riot police and explain the situation: his son was missing; what should he do? They laughed and told him he \u201cshould have stayed at home.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Yekaterina was contacting Alexey\u2019s friends, trying to find someone who knew where he was. No one did. \u201cAt midnight, we started calling the hospitals. I couldn\u2019t calm down \u2014 he wasn\u2019t in any hospital, not in any ambulance or morgue. It was just a nightmare,\u201d she recalls.\n\nAlexey was not at the city police station, either, where Yekaterina and her husband soon filed a missing persons report. There were many relatives gathered at the Moskovsky police precinct, she remembers. \u201cEveryone was crying.\u201d\n\nAt three in the morning, Yekaterina got a call from the police, who explained that Alexey was at the Leninsky police station (even though she\u2019d been told earlier that he wasn\u2019t there). \u201cWhen I arrived, the detainees were arranged facing the wall, as if they were hardened criminals,\u201d she says. \u201cI entered and he didn\u2019t turn around. I said, \u2018Son,\u2019 and he didn\u2019t turn around. Only when the woman leading him out said, \u2018You\u2019re allowed,\u2019 did he turn around finally and hug me. Then he kissed me and said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Mom.\u2019\u201d\n\nDetainees held in a gymnasium in Brest TUT.BY. Politics\n\nAt home, Alexey told his mother that police officers had stopped him on his way home. \u201cThey didn\u2019t like the hoodie he was wearing \u2014 a gift from his sister. It was a Vans hoodie; it says \u201cantihero\u201d with illustrations of a bird and a shoe. He wore it proudly, on special occasions,\u201d says Yekaterina.\n\nFrom her son\u2019s account, she knows the police also searched Alexey\u2019s backpack. When they found English-language textbooks inside, they asked Alexey, \u201cAre you a fucking Nazi?\u201d After this, they tackled him to the ground, beat him with clubs, and escorted him away, somewhere. He ended up in a basement.\n\n\u201cHe was treated like an adult,\u201d says Yekaterina. \u201cThey held him for six hours. He lay barefoot on the ground, in a pool of urine, face-down. He was with 16- and 17-year-old boys. They had to have their hands bound behind their heads. Police in combat boots stomped on the fingers of anyone who moved their hands. This was accompanied by swearing and screaming.\u201d\n\nAlexey told his mother that they used clubs on him in that basement, pummeling his sides. To limit bruising, the officers held magazines over his body as they hit him, he says. Alexey says he prayed instead of screaming. According to his mother, under her son\u2019s hoodie, he was wearing a shirt emblazoned with the . \u201cHe prayed that they wouldn\u2019t take off his hoodie. Is this kind of thing normal? I\u2019m saying it and even I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nBelarusian flag politics Here\u2019s why are protesters in Belarus are flying a white-and-red flag\n\nYekaterina says her son told the officers repeatedly that he\u2019s only 14 years old and asked to contact his parents. Instead, the guards smashed his phone. Later, when he started \u201ccoughing up blood,\u201d they refused to call an ambulance.\n\n\u201cThey put a pistol to their heads and reloaded it. It was psychological pressure. It\u2019s so awful that I can\u2019t even explain it. This is not a natural thing to do, you know?\u201d\n\nAt the Leninsky police station, Yekaterina also picked up a second young man who\u2019d been badly beaten. She\u2019d offered him a ride home. In the car, he described how the police had cut off his hair and laughed as they joked about forcing it in his mouth. They\u2019d make him \u201cchew on it,\u201d they said.\n\nYekaterina says her family needs therapy now. \u201cMy husband is devastated and I\u2019m devastated for one simple reason: We were unable to protect him. My husband drove around the city like a frantic animal, searching for his son amid the carnage and blood,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt matters greatly to me that my son doesn\u2019t develop a sense of vengeance. I want him to understand that evil exists, that he experienced this, and that we emerge from it with dignity. I want him to stand tall and continue shaping his own future.\u201d\n\nShe hasn\u2019t yet decided if she will file a report about the violence inflicted on her son. If the decision only affected her, she would file a complaint, she says. But Alexey is terrified and he\u2019s begged her not to pursue it. \u201cMom, don\u2019t file any complaint. Don\u2019t do anything,\u201d he says. \u201cThey wrote down my address. If I end up there again, I\u2019ll never get out.\u201d Yekaterina has tried to explain that her silence is a betrayal to him. \u201cI\u2019d rather you betray me,\u201d Alexey tells her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back there.\u201d\n\nBelarusian human rights activists say detainees will face enormous obstacles if they try to challenge their arrests or press criminal charges against police officers. According to Valdis Furgash, it\u2019s possible to file grievances against arrests and to appeal rulings, but getting results is extremely rare. \u201cThe system is built in a way that any evidence, unfortunately, will be rejected. It won\u2019t even be considered. If we\u2019re talking about torture, the situation is even worse because the term under Belarusian law remains ill-defined; it\u2019s especially difficult to find justice in these cases.\u201d\n\n\u201cBelarus is not a member of the Council of Europe, unfortunately, so European mechanisms like the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg are out of our reach,\u201d says Valentin Stefanovich. \u201cThe only thing we can use are UN mechanisms \u2014 namely, the Committee Against Torture.\n\nValdis Furgash says he worries that many of the people arrested and jailed this week won\u2019t ever get the paperwork to document their injuries, making it impossible to prove that they were abused in custody. \u201cPeople can\u2019t go right to a medical professional when they\u2019re in shock, or if they don\u2019t think there is a point. They might even fear that being examined could harm them further,\u201d Furgash points out. \u201cThis is why I\u2019m concerned that the sheer volume of this week\u2019s violence will become invisible.\u201d\n\nStory by Kristina Safonova Translation by Nikita Buchko", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, minimal-ui", "theme-color": "#000", "og": {"site_name": "Meduza", "title": "\u2018Like hell on Earth\u2019 Torture and dehumanization in Belarusian jails now threatens to end the Lukashenko regime.
