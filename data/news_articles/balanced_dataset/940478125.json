The foreign office rejected suggestions that the minister\u2019s statement was against diplomatic norms.\n\nForeign minister Qureshi has since then twice called a press conference to offer a clarification but later cancelled the invites. In Islamabad, the cancelled news conferences were seen to reflect the government\u2019s assessment that a mere clarification wasn\u2019t going to be enough to put relations between the two countries back on track.\n\nThere has been no official announcement about Gen Bajwa\u2019s visit yet.\n\nGen Bajwa did, however, meet Saudi Ambassador Admiral Nawaf Bin Said Al-Maliki on Monday to discuss what the army had then described as \u201cmatters of mutual interest, regional security situation and bilateral defence relations\u201d.\n\nThe newspaper, quoting diplomatic sources, suggested the visit had raised hopes in Islamabad that the recent \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d would be resolved soon.\n\nIt is a tough task, given how Saudi Arabia had called in a $ 1 billion loan extended at Imran Khan\u2019s request to bail out the economy in 2018. The Saudi package entailed $3 billion in loans and a $3.2 billion oil credit facility, according to Asian Nikkei Review. The oil credit facility was suspended in May and the Saudis later asked Pakistan to repay the loan in full. Pakistan repaid the $ 1 billion loan, borrowing from its \u201ciron brother\u201d China.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "initial-scale = 1.0, maximum-scale = 1.0, user-scalable = no, width = device-width", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://idrw.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cropped-logo-270x270.png"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
