The site will be closed forever. Thank you for your supports\".\n\nStricter copyright laws\n\nJapan will be enacting stricter copyright laws from January 2021 onwards. According to Kyodo News, the stricter laws will target leech websites as well.\n\nThis means websites that provide hyperlinks to download torrent files of pirated manga or anime will also be targeted.\n\nIn 2019, alleged manga pirate Romi Hoshino was arrested while trying to take a plane to Hong Kong from The Philippines.\n\nHe reportedly managed Manga Mura, which was considered one of the most notorious manga sharing websites at the time.\n\nCNN reported that Japanese officials said the losses from sales amounted to 320 billion yen (S$4.12 billion).\n\nThe site was operational from January 2016 to April 2018. During that time, the Philippines government said publishers claimed to have lost as much $2.9 billion (320 billion yen) in sales, according to Japan officials.\n\nAccording to Soranews, Japan publishers, including publishers of Weekly Shounen Jump and Shonen Magazine, jointly filed a lawsuit against websites they called \"successor sites\" to Manga Mura.\n\nAccording to Soranews, he was deemed by officials as \"a risk to public safety and security\".\n\nTotally unrelated but here's the latest episode of our podcast\n\nImage adapted from Sensorstechforum and Gamerevolution", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "fb": {"pages": 1885510495065962}, "og": {"title": "KissAnime, longstanding pirate anime streaming site, is 'closed forever'", "description": "Been around a while.", "url": "https://mothership.sg/2020/08/kissanime-taken-down/", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.mothership.sg/1/2020/08/kissanime-close.jpg"}, "description": "Been around a while."}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
