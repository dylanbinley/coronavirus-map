Picture Glenn Hampson\n\nHowever, employment increased with 114,700 jobs added between June and July 2020.\n\nFull-time employment rose by 43,500 people and part-time employment by 71,200 people.\n\nThe largest increases in employment were recorded in New South Wales with 56,800 people now in work.\n\nSeasonally adjusted figures show 308,600 people in NSW were jobless in July.\n\nAlmost 23,000 people in Victoria also got a job before stage four restrictions hit, and a further 19,100 people were employed in Western Australia.\n\n\n\nSmall decreases were seen in Queensland where 3700 more people found themselves out of work, and in the Northern Territory where 500 people were affected compared to June.\n\nMr Jarvis said the July data provides insight into the Australian labour market during stage three restrictions in Victoria.\n\n\u201cThe August labour force data will provide the first indication of the impact of stage four restrictions,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nCompared to a year ago, there were 282,800 fewer people employed full-time and 131,700 fewer people employed part-time.\n\nThe number of hours worked by Australians had a 1.3 per cent boost in July, and increased more for female than male workers.\n\nHOW YOUR STATE FARES\n\n\u2022 Tasmania: 6 per cent unemployment\n\n\u2022 South Australia: 7.9 per cent unemployment\n\n\u2022 Queensland: 8.8 per cent unemployment\n\n\u2022 Victoria: 6.8 per cent unemployment\n\n\u2022 NSW: 7.2 per cent unemployment\n\n\u2022 Northern Territory: 7.5 per cent unemployment\n\n\u2022 Western Australia: 8.3 per cent unemployment\n\n\u2022 ACT: 4.6 per cent unemployment\n\nmedia_camera Employment Minister Michaelia Cash says the government has launched a site called The Jobs Hub for people to find jobs in their local area. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Andrew Taylor\n\nTHE \u2018REAL\u2019 NUMBER IS MUCH HIGHER\n\nCommSec chief economist Craig James had anticipated unemployment would rise to 7.8 per cent.\n\n\u201cJobs rose more than expected,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut we know that there is a long way to go, especially incorporation of the effects of both stage four and stage three lockdown restrictions in Victoria.\u201d\n\nCommSec warned further border restrictions would constrain economic recovery, with Commonwealth Bank\u2019s economic arm currently forecasting a 9 per cent peak in unemployment.\n\n\u201cThe quicker that the jobless rate peaks and starts falling, the less damage and scarring will be done to the longer-term health of the economy,\u201d Mr James said.\n\n\n\nThe nation\u2019s official jobless rate is expected to peak about 9.25 per cent in the December quarter, and remain about 8.75 per cent in 2020-21, according to Treasury forecasts.\n\nEmployment Minister Michaelia Cash said the July labour force figures showed that when the health crisis was under control and restrictions on the economy were eased, jobs returned.\n\nSenator Cash said the return of 114,000 jobs highlighted the reliance on small and family businesses across Australia.\n\n\u201cWhat we have seen for the month of July is a very, very strong return of women to the workforce \u2026 almost 60,000,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut also an increase in the number of youth participating in the workforce, around 55,000.\u201d\n\nSenator Cash said the government was not blind to the \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d the stage four lockdown in Melbourne was having on the Australian economy.\n\n\u201cEvery job loss as a result of COVID-19 is devastating, and that is why the Morrison Government has put in place a suite of measures to help employers and employees to get through this crisis.\u201d\n\nBut Opposition treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers has again put the pressure on the government to announce job-creating measures before the Budget on October 6.\n\n\u201cEven numbers this confronting don\u2019t tell the full story,\u201d Mr Chalmers said.\n\n\u201cEvery day of delay, every day without a jobs plan, means too many Australians are out of work.\u201d\n\n\n\nAustralian Council of Trade Unions president Michele O\u2019Neil said even with a national wage subsidy scheme, more than a million people were now looking for work.\n\n\u201cWe know that the real rate of unemployment is much higher,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThese numbers are from before the second lockdown in Victoria, which has stood down hundreds of thousands of workers.\n\n\u201cThe million Australians now out of a job, and the millions more who are either reliant on JobKeeper or worried about their future, need leadership from this Government. They need a plan for jobs.\u201d\n\n\u2013 with Gerard Cockburn\n\nOriginally published as More than one million out of work", "METADATA": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "referrer": "origin", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/townsvillebulletin/ms-icon-70x70.png", "msapplication-square144x144logo": "https://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/townsvillebulletin/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/townsvillebulletin/ms-icon-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/townsvillebulletin/ms-icon-310x310.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/townsvillebulletin/ms-icon-144x144.png", "robots": "noarchive", "description": "The country has hit a worrying coronavirus milestone, with the more than one million Australians out of work for the first time.", "keywords": "unemployment rate, unemployment, Australia and New Zealand, Picture Glenn, Labour force figures, Oceania, Bjorn Jarvis, unemployment data, Labour Party, Australia, Glenn Hampson", "generator": "tcog", "articleid": "f409de8046a250a965ef10fe1b2029e6", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T05:03:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T05:03:48.000Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@tsv_bulletin", "title": "More than one million out of work", "description": "In a first for the nation, more than one million people were out of work, available to work and actively looking for work last month.", "image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/70b2bad7cf38da808e29144543f21ce2"}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "More than one million out of work", "description": "In a first for the nation, more than one million people were out of work, available to work and actively looking for work last month.", "url": "https://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/more-than-one-million-out-of-work-july-unemployment-data/news-story/f409de8046a250a965ef10fe1b2029e6", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/70b2bad7cf38da808e29144543f21ce2", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "vr": {"canonical": "https://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/more-than-one-million-out-of-work-july-unemployment-data/news-story/f409de8046a250a965ef10fe1b2029e6"}}}}
