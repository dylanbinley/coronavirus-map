I see myself at the centre of my Aboriginal universe. I see the newcomers of all stripes at the margins of my world.\"\n\nMelissa Lucashenko is breathless and full of apologies.\n\nThe Brisbane-based author is deep into writing her next book on a rural property in Queensland's Northern Rivers region and informs me she had lost track of time for our interview.\n\nTo paint a picture, she declares that she has driven to the top of a mountain where her phone could be in range and narrowly passed a carpet snake on her way up.\n\nAs a millennial with a phone constantly lighting up in my hand and no knowledge of snakes, I marvel and ask after her safety.\n\n\u201cCarpet snakes are harmless. They\u2019re lovely snakes,\u201d she says, laughing.\n\nMelissa Lucashenko.\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nThe Goorie author of Bundjalung and European heritage and winner of the 2019 Miles Franklin award for her novel Too Much Lip might be out of range on a cellular level, but she\u2019s thick in the political currents of the day, with hot takes on everything from slavery statues being toppled (\u201cthey\u2019re not being toppled, they\u2019re just a new installation with a whole new slant on it, I reckon. Chuck a plaque on it and look down onto the water face!\u201d she jokes) to the sweeping Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nLucashenko, who attended Black Lives Matter protests in Brisbane in June, says the movement was \u201cencouraging\u201d but there was still a long way to go in addressing the spectrum of racism in Australia - from Indigenous deaths in custody to media representation.\n\nIt\u2019s the most fun I\u2019ve had on the page - writing the scene in Too Much Lip where the cops turn up and they just get shredded mercilessly by the wit of the Blackfellas. I just love writing that stuff and I loved imagining my readers reading it as well.\n\n\u201cI would say I\u2019m encouraged. I\u2019m probably a pessimist by nature but very happy to be proven wrong. It\u2019s just a matter of getting rid of the stale pale males in the corridors of power and that\u2019s slowly happening too.\u201d\n\nLucashenko, who started Sisters Inside with Debbie Kilroy, an advocacy group supporting incarcerated Indigenous women, says the gendered impacts of policing and how they doubly impact Black women needed to be emphasised in the current racial conversation around Black Lives Matter.\n\n\u201cThe face of injustice needs to become any Black face, or any underclass face. It\u2019s the homeless Black kid who is picked up for trivial offences and ends up in prison with a hood on his head. The Ms Dhus' of the world (a 22-year-old Indigenous woman who died in West Australian police custody in 2014 after being picked up for unpaid fines) who...end up dying in agony when they are supposedly in the care of the state.\u201d\n\nLucashenko's 2013 Walkley-winning Griffith Review essay Sinking below sight told the stories of three women and how the threads of domestic violence, childhood trauma and poverty inform their lives. They are themes echoed in her book Too Much Lip tracing the story of Kerry Salter as she returns back to country on a stolen Harley to visit her ailing pop, only to become part of a land rights campaign over a multi-million dollar prison being built on ancestral land, while juggling staying one step ahead of the cops and unexpectedly falling in love with a spunky dugai (white man). The book is at once irreverent and weighty with gravity \u2013 a family drama exploring how class, colonialism, violence, and everyday racism are baked in as part of the almost mundane fabric of the characters' lives.\n\nIt turns out that sitting in a room and thinking and imagining other worlds is what I\u2019m put here to do.\n\nLucashenko's novelistic focus on land, profit and power reflects her belief that racism is not just about feelings, nasty words and slanging matches, but essentially the core structures that keep it in place - which at its heart is cold, hard economics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about economics. You can\u2019t take a continent from its rightful owners and keep it and pretend that\u2019s ok and reparations are not due unless you diminish those people through racism.\u201d\n\nFor a self-declared pessimist, Lucashenko's take on the future of racial justice is surprisingly hopeful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously only first steps towards a more just Australia and a more just world but the first stage is to recognise there\u2019s a problem. Now there\u2019s people realising that there\u2019s a better way to live and that endemic racism is very harmful, very costly in terms of lives, in terms of dollars, in terms of opportunities foregone,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making inroads. The more we talk straight and the more we share ideas - these kinds of seemingly radical ideas that racism can be overcome, that equality can be achieved and we can decolonise and make a better world - the more we can share those ideas and talk about them and not have our minds chained to these terrible colonial ideas the powers that be want them to be chained to - the quicker the revolution will arrive.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s so much going on in Aboriginal Australia. There\u2019s so much to say.\n\nLucashenko jokes that her journey to writing (she was written six books including Steam Pigs, Hard Yards, Mullumbimby and YA novels Killing Darcy and Too Flash) started with the realisation she wasn\u2019t much good at anything else.\n\n\u201cI think I just kept failing at everything else!\u201d she laughs.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that sitting in a room and thinking and imagining other worlds is what I\u2019m put here to do. I guess I\u2019m stubborn. I like to tell the truth and I don\u2019t let too many things get in the way of it.\n\nShe is also fuelled by a passion to tell untold stories about Aboriginal Australia, and credits her mentor and friend Cape York man Uncle Victor Hart as her inspiration in the craft of imagining alternative worlds.\n\n\u201c[Uncle Hart] has grown up in a fairly traditional community and family and one that just loves to take the piss and has very little time for mainstream ideas of who we are and who we should be and what the mainstream think we might be. I guess I\u2019ve taken that spirit of independence and - how would you put it? Rebellion. And I\u2019ve injected a lot of that into my work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much going on in Aboriginal Australia. There\u2019s so much to say, there\u2019s a lot of ideas to put down and a lot of characters to bring into the public eye.\u201d\n\nLucashenko, who is a judge for the SBS Emerging Writers' competition - a competition where emerging writers are offered the chance to submit stories about growing up in diverse Australia - says her best advice to budding writers is to free their mind from pre-conceptions and expectations to please.\n\n\u201cWhat that does is that it frees you from chains you don\u2019t even know you\u2019re wearing. When you start to talk back and craft a voice for yourself on the page that\u2019s independent of what mainstream Anglo Australia wants you to be, it\u2019s an absolute joy and liberation.\n\nLucashenko says her biggest joy comes with writing characters that will resonate with her readers including the delicious power reversals and sweet revenge on the corruption and ineptitude of the local dugai who seeks to plunder the town for profit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most fun I\u2019ve had on the page - writing the scene in Too Much Lip where the cops turn up and they just get shredded mercilessly by the wit of the Blackfellas. I just love writing that stuff and I loved imagining my readers reading it as well.\u201d\n\nLucashenko says real writing requires an internal excavation, what race scholar Dr. Cornel West called \u2018struggling against the white supremacist inside\u2019 and advised emerging writers to work on nourishing an authentic voice.\n\n\u201c[For me], it\u2019s about carving out space for [my] own Aboriginal voice, [my] own cultural perspective and working all the time to give it space and pushing aside those other thoughts and intrusive internally racist ideas. You get better at it as you get older and if you surround yourself with good people.\u201d\n\nIn a economically fractured environment, Lucashenko recommends that emerging writers diversify their income and get a second or preferably third job, \"so you are not trying to please the people who pay the bills\".\n\n\u201cIf you can do any other kind of paid work and write what your passion is, write what your truth is - than that\u2019s ideal. Writing is a shitty way to buy groceries and pay the bills - it\u2019s difficult and stressful, and also don\u2019t reinvent the wheel.\u201d\n\nHer last piece of advice to writers is to read voraciously and look to the contemporary social and political world around them to answer the question of what is the new perspective they need to contribute, ditching the idea they are an \u2018outsider\u2019.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see myself as an outsider. I see myself at the centre of my Aboriginal universe. I see the newcomers of all stripes at the margins of my world.\n\nMelissa Lucashenko is a judge for the SBS Emerging Writers' Competition.\n\nAre you a budding writer?
