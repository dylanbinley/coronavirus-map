I saw him lead Taiwan to become a democracy,\" Hsu said.\n\nThe memorial will remain until Aug. 16. No official word has been given on funeral arrangements.\n\nChina, which frequently hurled angry epithets at Lee over his promotion of Taiwan's' separate status, has largely ignored his passing.\n\nForeign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Friday responded only by saying \"Taiwan independence is an impassable road. China's national reunification and national rejuvenation is a major historical trend and cannot be stopped by anyone or any force.\"\n\nTaiwanese sentiment opposing political unification with China has risen to historical highs and voters this year reelected Tsai by a wide margin over her China-friendly Nationalist opponent.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=1100,user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "title": "Taiwanese pay respects to former President Lee Teng-hui", "keywords": "World,Latest Articles,The Mainichi,International,TAIWAN,CHINA,JAPAN", "description": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's leaders and its people were paying their respects Saturday to former President Lee Teng-hui, who died this week at age", "firstcreate": "2020-08-01 17:00:00", "lastupdate": "2020-08-01 17:00:17", "mainichi": {"art-type": "all"}, "mixi-check-robots": "noimage", "robots": "noarchive", "Hatena": {"": {"Bookmark": "noindex"}}, "og": {"title": "Taiwanese pay respects to former President Lee Teng-hui - The Mainichi", "type": "article", "locale": {"identifier": "en_US", "alternate": "ja_JP"}, "site_name": "The Mainichi", "url": "https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20200801/p2g/00m/0in/081000c", "description": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's leaders and its people were paying their respects Saturday to former President Lee Teng-hui, who died this week at age", "image": "https://cdn.mainichi.jp/vol1/2020/08/01/20200801p2g00m0in080000p/0c8.jpg?1"}, "twitter": {"site": "@themainichi", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"src": "https://cdn.mainichi.jp/vol1/2020/08/01/20200801p2g00m0in080000p/0c8.jpg?1"}, "title": "Taiwanese pay respects to former President Lee Teng-hui", "description": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's leaders and its people were paying their respects Saturday to former President Lee Teng-hui, who died this week at age", "url": "https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20200801/p2g/00m/0in/081000c"}, "fb": {"app_id": 829413960504653}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/themainichi/", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/themainichi/", "modified_time": "2020-08-01T17:00:17.000+0900"}, "cXenseParse": {"mai-entitlement": "free-entry", "recs": {"image": "https://cdn.mainichi.jp/vol1/2020/08/01/20200801p2g00m0in080000p/0c6.jpg?1", "mai-cbtitle": "Taiwanese pay respects to former President Lee Teng-hui", "publishtime": "2020-08-01T17:00:00.000+0900", "articleid": "20200801p2g00m0in081000c1"}, "genrecd-big": "p2g", "ch-category": "Latest Articles", "subdirectory": "The Mainichi", "mai-relevance": "International", "ch-country": "JAPAN", "genrecd-small": "0in", "genrecd-medium": "00m", "characters": "U-2600", "keywordline": "International", "mai-category": "m030000015", "atclid": "20200801p2g00m0in081000c"}, "ob": {"title": "Taiwanese pay respects to former President Lee Teng-hui", "keywordline": "International"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
