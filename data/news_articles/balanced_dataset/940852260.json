Christ used the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37) to show that we are all neighbors regardless of race or national origin.\n\nDonald Trump's campaign of hate, division and culture war founded on racism and conspiracy theories enables his supporters to hide behind the women's right to choose issue openly with \"Make America Great Again,\" which is pejorative code for \"Make America White Again.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Trump defends the Confederate battle fag, refuses to change the names of military bases honoring traitors, condemns the removal of graven images of Confederate \"heroes\" and conspires to deny voting rights to minorities, he is playing to what he knows his adoring \"disciples\" want to hear. When he sends federal troops into cities to attack peaceful demonstrators who are trying to force racial justice, he is displaying his claim to dictatorial power.\n\nWhen he condemns athletes who kneel during the playing of the National Anthem to show their support for Black Lives Matter, he demonstrates his complete lack of empathy, compassion and patriotism.\n\nOur flag and anthem were paid for with the blood of the brave who sacrificed everything for the right to protest injustice. When Mr. Trump makes childish remarks about the change of the name of Washington, D.C., football team and praises Christopher Columbus and Andrew Jackson, he only displays his ignorance and racism toward Native Americans.\n\nMr. Trump's racism is equaled by his misogyny. His infamous boast that, by virtue of his wealth and celebrity, he could sexually assault women and roam the dressing rooms of teenage beauty pageant participants was met with giggles of admiration by his supporters, many of whom have daughters of their own.\n\nMr. Trump as deacon of your church (1Timothy 8-13)? I hope not, but maybe.\n\nDAVID DRIVER\n\nStaunton", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Trump's racism is equaled by his misogyny, and some of you like it: Letter", "description": "\"Make America Great Again\" is pejorative code\u00a0for \"Make America White Again.\"", "url": "https://www.newsleader.com/story/opinion/readers/2020/08/14/trumps-racism-equaled-his-misogyny-and-some-you-like/3345476001/", "site_name": "The News Leader", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/02/27/PSTA/d048b9b7-0e07-410e-972a-a0d5a8738230-B9324585365Z.1_20161103091147_000_GERG999LU.1-0_1.jpg?crop=272,153,x0,y75&width=272&height=153&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 272, "height": 153}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "DAVID DRIVER", "content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "true"}, "description": "\"Make America Great Again\" is pejorative code\u00a0for \"Make America White Again.\"", "fb": {"pages": 104935809704, "app_id": 169868743049940}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/02/27/PSTA/d048b9b7-0e07-410e-972a-a0d5a8738230-B9324585365Z.1_20161103091147_000_GERG999LU.1-0_1.jpg?crop=272,153,x0,y75&width=272&height=136&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@NewsLeaderNOW", "creator": "@NewsLeaderNOW", "title": "Trump's racism is equaled by his misogyny, and some of you like it: Letter", "description": "\"Make America Great Again\" is pejorative code\u00a0for \"Make America White Again.\""}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
