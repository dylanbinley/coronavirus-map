It also expects a mid three-digit-million amount in euros for the settlements.\n\nInvestors in Germany are also suing Daimler for $1 billion, accusing it of concealing the use of emissions cheating software. Daimler denies the allegations.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Emma Thomasson; Editing by Susan Fenton and David Evans)", "METADATA": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooFinance", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Daimler has reached an agreement to settle U.S. proceedings relating to investigations into software to cheat diesel emissions tests that will result in costs of about $1.5 billion, the German carmaker said on Thursday.
