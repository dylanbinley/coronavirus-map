It has 136 staff, 87 being teachers and 49 support-staff.\n\nThe case was filed after the teachers, who were categorised as nonessential staff, were subjected to a 65 per cent salary reduction and locked out of virtual learning program as the institution scaled down operations due to Covid-19 pandemic that disrupted learning across the country.\n\nBesides subjecting teachers to 65 and 45 per cent salary reduction, the institution was also forced to reduce tuition fees by 30 per cent for nursery section, 25 per cent and 20 per cent for primary and secondary schools respectively following pressure from the parents.\n\nThe school's senior head teacher Jonah Safari said owing to the untimely closure of all schools, the institution was faced with difficulties on how best the situation could be managed and after wider consultations pay-cut option was arrived at as opposed to layoffs.\n\nHe said that as soon as the Covid-19 pandemic set in and persisted, parents and guardians agitated for fee reduction, which upon implementation, led to a reduction in cash flow.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Kenya Legal Affairs By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

The critical challenge the school is faced with is the ability to pay salaries when there is no normal schooling,\" said Mr Safari.\n\nThe institution noted that reduction of salaries was forecast on reduced income from school fees, unbudgeted costs of virtual learning and ICT infrastructure and unpaid school fees.\n\nBut the teachers argued that the institution has failed to provide equal treatment including right to equal opportunity at work when it selectively discriminated against them.\n\n\"There was no consensus and negotiations over the pay cuts the decision was made entirely by the board at the exclusion of the teachers. We feel victimised and discriminated upon and have been subjected to psychological stress,\" said the teachers.\n\nThe teachers also complained that the process of categorising them into critical, essential and non-essential service providers was not transparent since it did not consider those employees who have served the school for longer years.", "METADATA": {"description": "Seven teachers, who had sued a private school in Mombasa over pay cut, have suffered a blow after the court declined to review the reduction and award damages.", "google-site-verification": "bGxG4qeN9up-gMXKjsgylykqjVrzxLjg1rQrP3K-rJk", "keywords": "Africa, news, politics, economy, trade, business, sports, current events, travel, Kenya, East Africa, Legal and Judicial Affairs", "msvalidate.01": "72401C28AAAC95E8D3FF1881A90F2C4D", "robots": "noarchive", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Seven teachers, who had sued a private school in Mombasa over pay cut, have suffered a blow after the court declined to review the reduction and award damages.", "image": "https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png", "site": "@allafrica", "title": "Kenya: Mombasa Teachers Lose Case Against School Over Pay Cut"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "article": {"modified_time": "2020-08-12T16:55:14+0000", "published_time": "2020-08-12T16:55:14+0000", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/allAfricacom/98946450029", "section": "News", "tag": "Legal and Judicial Affairs"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100369188719, "pages": 98946450029}, "og": {"description": "Seven teachers, who had sued a private school in Mombasa over pay cut, have suffered a blow after the court declined to review the reduction and award damages.", "image": "https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png", "site_name": "allAfrica.com", "title": "Kenya: Mombasa Teachers Lose Case Against School Over Pay Cut", "type": "article", "url": "https://allafrica.com/stories/202008120955.html"}}}}
