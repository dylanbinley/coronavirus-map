They told Mnangagwa that Ramaphosa, who is also the AU chair, was keen to know what was happening and what role he can play to diffuse tension.\n\nMnangagwa and Moyo, however, reportedly expressed concern over the three\u2019s conduct.\n\nOfficials said Mnangagwa and his delegation kept telling the envoys that there was no crisis in Zimbabwe, arguing that the impression that there was a crisis was coming from the countries\u2019 Western enemies working with local partners, averments he already had made in his Heroes and Defence Forces Day speeches.\n\n\u201cThey produced old videos and pictures which were being circulated on the social media to argue that the #ZimbabweanLivesMatter campaign was being run on old material belonging to the previous administration and insisted that there was no crisis in the country,\u201d an official said.\n\n\u201cThe president actually accused the envoys of breaching protocol by setting up meetings outside their mandate since their role was to just convey President Ramaphosa\u2019s message and to hear the side of the Zimbabwe government.\n\n\u201cHe told them that they were just presidential envoys and not a fact-finding mission and as such, they were not mandated to meet everyone else except the president and his team.\u201d\n\nThrough South African ambassador to Zimbabwe Mphakama Mbete \u2013 brother to Baleka \u2013 the envoys had already scheduled meetings with MDC Alliance leader Nelson Chamisa, MDC-T leader Thokozani Khupe and the Political Actors Dialogue through Lovemore Madhuku as well as a number of civil society organisations.\n\n\u201cThe common sentiment within was that there is unjustified pressure on government ahead of the Sadc heads of state meeting which is taking place next week, probably so that the country can be put on the security agenda. That is the main reason why they could not be allowed to get a second opinion,\u201d a source said.\n\n\u201cThe envoys tried to argue that they had a mandate to meet the other stakeholders but were told in no uncertain terms that that would not happen and from there was nothing they could do but pack their bags and return to their country.\u201d\n\nAs preparations for the Sadc summit gather momentum, government yesterday rushed to pre-empt the agenda, arguing that Zimbabwe will not even be on the table.\n\n\u201cThere is no Zimbabwean issue before the Sadc Organ on Politics, Defence and Security. Neither is there one such issue before the Sadc summit. Definitely, there is no such issue before the continental body, the African Union,\u201d Information minister Monica Mutsvangwa said in a statement last night.\n\nShe also said spirited efforts to force regional intervention by South African opposition leader Julius Malema and senior ANC officials have no effect on Zimbabwean diplomatic relations in Africa and beyond.\n\n\u201cCrisis in diplomacy has specific and defined circumstances if that goes beyond day to day banter. All said, there is no crisis in Zimbabwe which needs external intervention under established international treaties and conventions,\u201d she said.\n\nForeign Affairs secretary James Manzou on Wednesday told the state media the envoys had no obligation to meet opposition parties and civic society as that would have been a breach of diplomatic protocol.\n\n\u201cThe task of the special envoy is to faithfully deliver the message to the receiving head of state and none other. Upon delivery of the message, the envoy listens attentively to the response of the receiving head of state. After which the envoy returns to his head of state to faithfully deliver the response he would have received.\n\n\u201cUpon delivery he may or may not get further instructions depending on the issue. Just to emphasise that such matters are between the heads of state and none other. This is the diplomatic etiquette or protocol followed during the important bilateral visit to Zimbabwe by special envoys of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, to the head of a neighbour and sisterly country,\u201d Manzou, who is Zimbabwe\u2019s former ambassador to the European Union, said.\n\nUsing his official Twitter account, @Jamwanda2, Mnangagwa\u2019s spokesperson George Charamba echoed the same sentiments saying: \u201cClearing confusion over purpose and mandate of presidential special envoys: Presidential special envoys are deputations between two heads of state. Theirs is to deliver a message from one head of state to another and, to take back the response to sending head of state.\u201d\n\nBut secretary for external relations in the MDC-A, Gladys Hlatswayo, accused the Zanu-PF government of blocking the envoys because they had things to hide.\n\n\u201cWe received invitations through the South African Embassy to the effect that we were supposed to be on standby for a meeting with the envoys. So we prepared for the meeting and waited the entire day only to be called at the end of the day by the South African embassy and being told that unfortunately, the meeting had been cancelled and the envoys were going back to South Africa,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is quite clear that the meeting was cancelled because Mnangagwa does not want the envoys to engage with us and others despite having been invited. There was willingness by the envoys to meet with us. So our understanding is that it is Zanu-PF that blocked the envoys from meeting with us because they have things to hide.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Mnangagwa has been accused of frustrating diplomatic overtures.\n\nSadc leaders were left frustrated early this year by the Mnangagwa administration following his decision to block former South African president Thabo Mbeki from mediating in the proposed dialogue with MDC-T leader Nelson Chamisa.\n\nSadc countries \u2013 in particular economic powerhouse, South Africa, and Botswana \u2013 were unhappy with Zimbabwe\u2019s ongoing social, economic and political crisis, bad investment environment, state interference in public institutions, lack of respect for trade agreements and lack of competition in business.\n\nMbeki visited Zimbabwe mid-December last year on a Sadc-initiated mission to nudge Zanu-PF and MDC into negotiations. This was after regional leaders realised Harare\u2019s problems were caused more by a political crisis than the so-called Western sanctions.\n\nDuring his visit, Mbeki \u2013 famed for brokering the 2009 Global Political Agreement, which brought together Zanu-PF and MDC into a unity government \u2013 also met political leaders who are part of the Political Actors Dialogue (Polad) and civil society organisations.\n\nThe former South African president promised to return to Harare by December 30, 2019, to continue with the preliminary talks, but has not done so, amid reports Mnangagwa ignored calls from the respected African elder.\n\nBefore Mbeki\u2019s visit, regional leaders had the view that Chamisa did not want dialogue, but they later realised through discussions with him and other senior MDC party officials that he was just against the idea of participating in a dialogue being held under the discredited Polad platform, which many have dismissed as Mnangagwa\u2019s political fan club.Source \u2013 the independent", "METADATA": {"yandex-verification": "f61f76fcaa642799", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "CORNERED President Emmerson Mnangagwa blocked envoys sent by his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa from meeting opposition political party leaders", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mnangagwa in a fix as the world crumbles under his feet | Zimbabwe News", "description": "CORNERED President Emmerson Mnangagwa blocked envoys sent by his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa from meeting opposition political party leaders", "url": "http://www.thezimbabwenewslive.com/mnangagwa-in-a-fix-as-the-world-crumbles-under-his-feet/", "site_name": "Zimbabwe News", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.thezimbabwenewslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mnangagwa.jpg", "width": 1080, "height": 765}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theZimNewsLive", "published_time": "2020-08-15T00:11:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-15T00:18:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@thezimnewslive", "site": "@thezimnewslive"}, "generator": "Site Kit by Google 1.13.1", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.thezimbabwenewslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cropped-newlogo-270x270.jpg", "google-site-verification": "nxVrehMbq5wJku85QXTHZpWdU05bJP7CHqSkYkAuKHY"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
