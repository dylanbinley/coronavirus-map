A video of this has gone viral on social media.\n\n\u201cThe riots of Tuesday night were not communal. But the mob was very violent and directionless. If it had attacked the temple, it could have descended into a communal riot. So some of the youths who were trying to pacify the crowds formed a human chain around the temple,\u201d said a resident.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress MLA Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy has appealed for peace and said there had been no incident of this nature in the last 25 years in the locality. His house was set on fire when and he and his family members were away. The rioters carried machetes and petrol bombs and looted jewellery and all other material at home, he said. \u201cNot even pillows were spared in my house,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been living in that house for the past 50 years. I was born and raised in that house. Even my brother\u2019s house was burnt. Where do we go now? What protection do I have as an MLA?\u201d he asked.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Bengaluru violence | Muslim youth stand guard at local temple", "atdlayout": "articlepage", "description": "They form a human chain to protect it", "fragment": "!", "keywords": "muslim youth,temple,Bengaluru violence,offensive post against Prophet Mohammed,communal clashes,Muslim mobs protest,Kaval Byrasandra,DJ Halli Police Station,Naveen,Akhanda Srinivasamurthy,inflamatory post on Facebook,violence in Bengaluru due to FB post,communal flareup", "news_keywords": "muslim youth,temple,Bengaluru violence,offensive post against Prophet Mohammed,communal clashes,Muslim mobs protest,Kaval Byrasandra,DJ Halli Police Station,Naveen,Akhanda Srinivasamurthy,inflamatory post on Facebook,violence in Bengaluru due to FB post,communal flareup", "publish-date": "2020-08-13T04:44:00+05:30", "created-date": "2020-08-13T04:44:00+05:30", "modified-date": "2020-08-13T14:23:00+05:30", "twitter": {"creator": "Special Correspondent", "title": "Bengaluru violence | Muslim youth stand guard at local temple", "description": "They form a human chain to protect it", "image": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/6xqfl2/article32343293.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bangalore", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@The_Hindu", "domain": "thehindu.com", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "The Hindu", "googleplay": "The Hindu (Official App)", "iphone": "The Hindu for iPhone"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.mobstac.thehindu", "iphone": 771672321}}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=584786636", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mobstac.thehindu", "fb": {"app_id": 137450626398044, "pages": 163974433696568}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hindu", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bengaluru-violence-muslim-youth-stand-guard-at-local-temple/article32339814.ece", "type": "article", "title": "Bengaluru violence | Muslim youth stand guard at local temple", "description": "They form a human chain to protect it", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/6xqfl2/article32343293.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bangalore", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"author": "Special Correspondent", "tag": "communal flareup", "section": "Karnataka"}, "msvalidate.01": "00762243DAFA333A5A6D97CE4545BDB2", "yandex-verification": "ff4648e5089d361d", "ahrefs-site-verification": "6df5b97abf2ea60f2d4123265496b92b4faa009ceff5444e0b8482ebddd508d6", "theme-color": "#fff"}}}
