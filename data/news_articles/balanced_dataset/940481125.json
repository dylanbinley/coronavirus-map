(File photo)\n\n\u201cMixed messages\u201d on coronavirus testing advice and a lack of funding during lockdown left doctors feeling \u201cincompetent when [they] were trying their hardest\u201d, research has found.\n\nA survey of GP practices carried out by University of Auckland researchers in the lead-up to the latest Covid-19 lockdown showed as many as one in five were worried about getting funding for testing, while others reported having referrals for swabs declined altogether.\n\nThe research, carried out among 182 GPs between July 24 and August 6 (before community transmission re-emerged), paints a picture of the importance of clear messaging about testing.\n\nPeople join the long queues at a pop-up testing station in South Auckland's \u014ctara.\n\nProfessor Felicity Goodyear-Smith of the university\u2019s faculty of medical and health sciences said it was \u201ccrucial\u201d that clear messaging was accompanied by the \u201ccriteria, resources and funding for getting it done\u201d.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* GPs' financial strain a function of funding system, researcher says\n\n* Coronavirus: GPs 'angry' and 'disappointed' by funding back-track\n\n* Coronavirus: GP practices' finances hit by drop in patients during lockdown\n\n\n\nTesting was the biggest concern raised in the survey \u2013 the latest in a series of four since Covid-19 emerged in New Zealand.\n\nOne in five practices \u2013 20 per cent \u2013 had concerns about getting funding for testing.\n\nGPs felt demoralised by inconsistent, \u201cconstantly changing rules\u201d for Covid-19 testing, and felt unfairly blamed in the media for low surveillance when they were unable to test due to restrictive criteria or lack of supplies, they found.\n\nOne doctor surveyed said what was said in stand-up daily press conferences \u201cdidn\u2019t necessarily reflect reality\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister was telling everyone to get a test, but we couldn\u2019t do them due to criteria or funding or lack of equipment,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cThis made us look incompetent when we were trying our hardest.\u201d\n\nWhile most were able to get patients tested, about 16 per cent of GPs were unable to do this for a few or more, the results showed.\n\nMYTCHALL BRANSGROVE/STUFF Some GPs reported having difficulty in getting people tested despite their judgment it was necessary.\n\nOne GP said their swab referrals had been declined on \u201cmultiple occasions\u201d at local testing centres \u201cdespite it being my clinical judgment that they should be swabbed\u201d.\n\nOnly 7 per cent of practices tested 40 or more patients \u2013 down from 28 per cent in the previous survey, carried out in late June.\n\nOne reported \u201congoing confusion\u201d about testing among GPs and a \u201cdisconnect between what we actually do versus what the Minister thinks we don\u2019t do\u201d.\n\nThey raised the issue of requiring more accessible/walk-in community-based assessment centres (CBACs) \u2013 something that has been ramped up in the response to new community transmission in Auckland.\n\nAnother said they felt the Government was \u201cblaming\u201d them for not testing enough \u201cwhen it is their problem\u201d, and complained of \u201cbroken promises to support us financially\u201d.\n\nAnother said media often reported information that had not yet trickled down to individual practices, such as advice to be tested while clinics were not given \u201cenough supplies to do so\u201d.\n\n\u201cPatients think you are lying to them as [they] have been told to go and get tested.\u201d\n\nOverall, the strain of Covid-19 on general practice continued, with 69 per cent of those surveyed reporting significant to severe impact, and only 6 per cent no ongoing effect.\n\nOn Tuesday, after more than 100 days with no community transmission, four people in Auckland were confirmed as Covid-19, prompting a change in alert levels across the country.\n\nIt is still not known how the family contracted the illness.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "noarchive",
