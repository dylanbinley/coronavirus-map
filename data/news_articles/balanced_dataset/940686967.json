Susukan had reportedly been seen earlier in the day in President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s home city of Davao.\n\nPhilippine National Police (PNP) Chief Gen. Archie Gamboa said in a statement that Susukan was turned over to the local police at the residence of Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) chair Nur Misuari in Y\u00f1igue Subdivision, Maa, Davao City.\n\n\u201cWe thank chairman Nur Misuari for facilitating the negotiation between the PNP, headed by Police Col. Kirby John Kraft, the Davao City director and (Susukan),\u201d said Gamboa.\n\nUpon learning of Susukan\u2019s presence in the city, the PNP informed Davao\u2019s mayor, Inday Sara Duterte, \u201cwho assured us of her full cooperation and assistance to ensure the peaceful handover and orderly transfer of custody to proper authorities,\u201d Gamboa said.\n\nSusukan has been arrested in connection with 23 murders, five kidnappings and illegal detentions, and six frustrated homicides. He is a member of the ASG faction led by Hadjan Sawadjaan, whom the US has identified as the acting leader of Daesh in the Philippines.\n\nThe PNP said Susukan will undergo a medical examination at Camp Quintin Merecido Hospital before being transferred to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) General Headquarters in Camp Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, Quezon City.\n\nThe military is investigating reports that Susukan had surrendered to Misuari in Jolo in the first week of August, according to AFP Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom) spokesman Maj. Arvin Encinas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still verifying the information,\u201d Encinas told Arab News. \u201cConsidering he did not surrender to government authorities, we still consider him an enemy. And even if he did surrender to Misuari, that does not give him amnesty. He is still liable for all his crimes.\u201d\n\nCiting intelligence sources, reports claimed Misuari had brought Susukan to Davao City for medical treatment, specifically to have him fitted with a prosthetic replacement for his left arm, which he lost last year during a shootout with government forces. According to Encinas, however, Susukan \u201cwas still in Jolo.\u201d\n\nDefense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, meanwhile, told reporters there was no official confirmation of the ASG leader\u2019s alleged presence in Davao City.\n\n\u201cI already talked to the commander of Eastern Mindanao Command. He was also unaware of why Misuari and Susukan (were) together in Davao City. Susukan is wanted by the military,\u201d Lorenzana said. \u201cI\u2019m still awaiting the official report.\u201d\n\nMisuari, meanwhile, is expected to meet with President Duterte in the next few days. MNLF spokespeople were not available for comment at the time of writing.\n\nSusukan is also wanted in Malaysia for involvement in cross-border crimes in the waters off the Malaysian state of Sabah on the northeast coast of Borneo. He has been charged with the murder of Malaysian national Bernard Then Ted Fen, who was kidnapped by ASG gunmen at a restaurant in Sabah in May 2015.", "METADATA": {"description": "MANILA: The Philippine authorities announced\u00a0late Thursday that Anduljihad\u00a0Indang Susukan, a leader in the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), is now in police custody.
