More than 10,000 fires were recorded in the first 10 days of August, up 17pc from the same period a year ago, according to data from the country's national space research agency, Inpe.\n\nBut in a speech to other South American leaders on Tuesday, Mr Bolsonaro challenged foreign representatives to fly over the Amazon, saying that travelling by air from the far-flung cities of Boa Vista to Manaus, you would not see a single flame.\n\n\"They won't find any spot of fire, nor a quarter of a hectare deforested,\" the former army captain told a meeting of members of the Leticia Pact, an agreement between Amazon countries to protect the rainforest.\n\n\"This story that the Amazon is going up in flames is a lie and we must combat it with true numbers,\" he said.\n\nMr Bolsonaro interfered in Inpe after it released unfavourable data on Amazon deforestation last year, firing the agency's head, Ricardo Galvao, who defended his agency's numbers that showed rising destruction.\n\nIn his speech, Mr Bolsonaro argued that Brazil has shown itself capable of protecting the Amazon alone because the majority of the forest is still standing.\n\nHe said the Amazon is a wet forest that preserves itself and does not catch fire.\n\nThe media and foreign governments are presenting a false narrative about the Amazon, he said.\n\nExperts say that fires are not a natural phenomenon in the rainforest, but are usually man-made in order to clear deforested land for pasture.\n\nIrish Independent", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover", "description": "Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has angrily denied the existence of fires in the Amazon rainforest, calling it a \"lie,\" despite data produced by his own government showing that thousands of fires are surging across the region.", "fb": {"pages": 96796398469, "app_id": 714861305308164}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=335158729, app-argument=https://www.independent.ie/world-news/latin-america/data-showing-10000-fires-in-amazon-forest-a-lie-claims-bolsonaro-39445790.html", "og": {"title": "Data showing 10,000 fires in Amazon forest 'a lie', claims Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro", "site_name": "independent", "description": "Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has angrily denied the existence of fires in the Amazon rainforest, calling it a \"lie,\" despite data produced by his own government showing that thousands of fires are surging across the region.", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/world-news/latin-america/data-showing-10000-fires-in-amazon-forest-a-lie-claims-bolsonaro-39445790.html", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/96fe8/39445548.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/page32_bolsonaro.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/96fe8/39445548.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/page32_bolsonaro.jpg", "type": "image/png", "width": 1240, "height": 700}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Independent_ie", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/world-news/latin-america/data-showing-10000-fires-in-amazon-forest-a-lie-claims-bolsonaro-39445790.html", "title": "Data showing 10,000 fires in Amazon forest 'a lie', claims Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro", "description": "Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has angrily denied the existence of fires in the Amazon rainforest, calling it a \"lie,\" despite data produced by his own government showing that thousands of fires are surging across the region.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/96fe8/39445548.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/page32_bolsonaro.jpg", "alt": "Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
