But, scores of celebrities seem to have their finances thrive despite a global health crisis. And, Dwayne Johnson tops the list yet again as Hollywood\u2019s highest-paid actor for two years in a row.\n\nAs per the stats revealed by \u201cForbes\u201d; Johnson raked in a whopping $87.5 million in the last fiscal year ending June 2020. A sizeable portion of it comes from the former wrestler\u2019s forthcoming Netflix release, \u201cRed Notice\u201d that saw him draw $23.5 million. That aside, Johnson\u2019s uber-successful Under Armour line, \u201cProject Rock\u201d has been one of the actor\u2019s other successful innings too. The publication estimated that the top 10 male earners collectively made $545.5 million this year.\n\nJohnson made it to the top spot the last year as well, as his earnings were $89.4 million. A large part of it came from his roles in the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d spin-off \u201cHobbs & Shaw.\u201d\n\nComing a close second is Ryan Reynolds, with a total income of $ 71.5 million. The third on the list is Mark Wahlberg at $58 million, followed by Ben Affleck at $55 million, and Vin Diesel with $54 million. Indian actor Akshay Kumar finds a spot in the list with annual earnings of ($48.5 million) followed by Lin-Manuel Miranda ($45.5 million), Will Smith ($44.5 million), Adam Sandler ($41 million), and Jackie Chan ($40 million).\n\nJohnson might be a heartthrob onscreen, but he\u2019s an out and out doting father off it. This quarantine, while The Rock is cooped up indoors just like most of us, he\u2019s up to something special: convince his youngest daughter that he is the voice of Maui in Moana.\n\nWhile the news is gush-worthy, here\u2019s what fans need to know. His little daughter Tia happens to be a fan of \u201cYou\u2019re Welcome\u201d from Moana. But there\u2019s a catch: no matter how many times Johnson tries to croon the track to the little one, she just doesn\u2019t seem to be convinced that he\u2019s actually Maui. The actor put up a rather adorable Instagram post suggesting the same, and how he\u2019s not lost hope despite the repeated failures. He actually sings to her soft toys!\n\nIf there\u2019s something heartwarming that\u2019s on IG at present, it has got to be this.\n\nReuters", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "news, dwayne johnson, forbes, highest earning, actor, netflix", "fb": {"app_id": 229373533940657, "pages": 492371650790156}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Latin Times", "url": "https://www.latintimes.com/dwayne-johnson-rocks-chart-hollywoods-highest-paid-actor-460840", "title": "Dwayne Johnson Rocks The Chart As Hollywood's Highest Paid Actor", "description": "Johnson made it to the top spot the last year as well, as his earnings were $89.4 million.
