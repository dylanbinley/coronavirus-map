According to the ONS, July figures showed an increase in cases which has since levelled off.\n\nAn array of new lockdown measures, including bans on indoor meetings in Greater Manchester and other parts of northern England, as well as ordering quarantine for travellers returning from Spain, appears to have halted the spike.\n\nBut the number of cases has not gone down and there were an average of 3,800 people a day in England getting infected with virus between August 3 and August 9.\n\nRead more Brits face huge costs to return from France before quarantine- LIVE\n\nThis is up from an average of 3,700 in the previous week, but down from an estimated 4,200 infections the week before.\n\nThe ONS said in an update on its website: \"There is some evidence of a small increase in people testing positive for COVID-19 in July 2020 after a low point in June, but this appears to have now levelled off.\"\n\nThe ONS uses statistical modelling to estimate how many people have had the virus, rather than just relying on tests themselves. This means that the figures it gives are estimates.\n\nThe figure of 28,300 people with coronavirus could be as high as 40,700 or as low as 19,000, the ONS said, while the 3,800 new cases a day might be as high as 5,900 or as low as 2,300.\n\nIts numbers provide a more consistent picture than Government figures because the number of people it tests has remained the same since April, whether or not they have symptoms.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#dc062b", "og": {"url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/england-coronavirus-cases-steady-ons-figures-a4525076.html", "title": "Virus case numbers steady for two weeks straight after July jump", "description": "The number of people infected\u00a0with coronavirus in England has remained steady for the second week in a row, official figures suggest.
