the coordination of all the traffic signals in the Region and the development of a Traffic Management Centre to manage them to minimise traffic challenges.\n\nThe completion of the dualization of the Accra- Tema Beach Road between the Black Star Square to Tema Community Three would ease traffic congestion along the stretch.\n\nThe project seeks to improve the traffic capacity along the stretch to ensure the safety of commuters and other road users.\n\nThe project would go through communities like Osu, La, Teshie, Nungua, Tema Community Three and Sakumono.\n\nAt the groundbreaking ceremony at Nungua, Vice President Bawumia said the Akufo-Addo led Government had begun constructing six major interchanges across the country and at the various stages of completion.\n\nThey included Accra-Tema Motorway Interchange First Phase, Pokuase Interchange, Tamale Interchange, Obetsebi-Lamptey Interchange, Nungua Barrier Interchange and Takoradi PTC Interchange.\n\nThe Vice President stated that since 2017, the Akufo-Addo's Government had asphalted a total of 595 km of roads in urban areas, particularly in Accra, Kumasi, Cape Coast and Takoradi.\n\nAdditionally, there are ongoing 84-km Accra inner city roads and 100-km Kumasi inner city roads being funded under the Sinohydro Development Project Agreement, whilst various feeder roads upgrading were underway across the sub-urban areas to boost economic activities and productivity.\n\nMr Kwasi Amoako-Attah, the Roads and Highways Minister, on his part, said the Akufo-Addo's government was putting his promises into action as the President declared the year 2020 as the \"Year of Roads\".\n\nGiving more information about the Accra-Tema Beach Road Project, Mr Amoako-Attah stated that the contractors would construct new culverts and bridges to improve the flow of running water, erect streetlights to improve lightening along the stretch and walkways to ensure the safety of pedestrians.\n\nThe Minister gave the assurance that the government would pay requisite compensation to those who would be affected by the construction works.\n\nMr Amoako-Attah assured of his Ministry's determination to supervise the construction works to ensure value for money.\n\nNii Odaifio Wulentsi, Nungua Mantse, expressed appreciation to President Akufo-Addo for making real his promises and pledged the cooperation and support of the traditional authorities in the area to ensure timely completion of the project.\n\nHe was of the conviction that the completion of the road project would boost economic activities in the area and improve their livelihoods.\n\n\u2014GNA", "METADATA": {"title": "Bawumia Cuts Sod Cor Construction Of $100 million Accra-Tema Beach Road Improvement Project", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1", "description": "Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia Friday cuts the sod for the construction of $100 million Accra-Tema Beach Road Improvement Project.", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@modernghanaweb", "title": "Bawumia Cuts Sod Cor Construction Of $100 million Accra-Tema Beach Road Improvement Project", "description": "Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia Friday cuts the sod for the construction of $100 million Accra-Tema Beach Road Improvement Project.", "creator": "@modernghanaweb", "image": {"src": "https://cdn.modernghana.com/images/content/814202084151-1j041q5ccw-1.18650331.jpg"}, "domain": "www.modernghana.com"}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Modern Ghana", "title": "Bawumia Cuts Sod Cor Construction Of $100 million Accra-Tema Beach Road Improvement Project", "url": "https://www.modernghana.com/news/1023122/bawumia-cuts-sod-cor-construction-of-100-million.html", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.modernghana.com/images/content/814202084151-1j041q5ccw-1.18650331.jpg", "alt": "Bawumia Cuts Sod Cor Construction Of $100 million Accra-Tema Beach Road Improvement Project"}, "description": "Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia Friday cuts the sod for the construction of $100 million Accra-Tema Beach Road Improvement Project."}, "fb": {"app_id": 1403992796296002}, "article": {"section": "News", "author": "https://facebook.com/modernghanaweb"}, "google-site-verification": "RB6eN0-MWUIQzfBhZxVzb1_6i4asmj0bAS6GmeqlKnE", "msvalidate.01": "829F79F50089C06F7BA89C25B804CC7D", "theme-color": "#bb1919", "application-name": "Modern Ghana", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#bb1919", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "#bb1919", "msapplication-TileColor": "#bb1919"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
