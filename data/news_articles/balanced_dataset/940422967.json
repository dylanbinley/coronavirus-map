He hailed the California senator, the 55-year-old former prosecutor who a year ago excoriated Biden on a primary debate stage, as the right woman to help him defeat Trump and then lead a nation facing crises in triplicate: a pandemic, wounded economy and long-simmering reckoning with racism.\n\nHarris, Biden declared at a high school gymnasium in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, is \u201csmart, she\u2019s tough, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s a proven fighter for the backbone of this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cKamala knows how to govern. She knows how to make the hard calls. She\u2019s ready to do this job on day one,\u201d he said.\n\nReflecting the coronavirus pandemic, both candidates came onstage wearing protective masks in a high school gym with relatively few in attendance, not in a hall filled with cheering supporters as would normally be the case. Both spoke without masks but did not physically embrace.\n\nBiden praised her experience vigorously questioning Trump administration officials in the Senate, and highlighted the historic nature of her pick, noting she\u2019s the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica.\n\n\u201cThis morning, all across the nation, little girls woke up \u2014 especially little black and brown girls, who so often feel overlooked and undervalued in their communities. But today, today, just maybe, they\u2019re seeing themselves for the first time in a new way,\u201d Biden said.\n\nHarris sat feet away from Biden, listening with her protective mask off.\n\nTaking the stage after him, she flicked at some of the gender critiques she\u2019d faced throughout the Democratic primary, saying she was \u201cmindful of all the ambitious women before me, whose sacrifice, determination and resilience makes my presence here today even possible.\u201d She then launched into an attack on Trump, lambasting him for a lack of leadership on the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment of real consequence for America. Everything we care about \u2014 our economy, our health, our children, the kind of country we live in \u2014 it\u2019s all on the line,\u201d she said.\n\nBiden and Harris showed clear affection toward one another, with Biden calling her an \u201chonorary Biden\u201d and Harris offering an emotional tribute to his son Beau, whom she was friends with when both served as attorneys general. Biden seemed overcome with emotion as Harris spoke of Beau, who died in 2015, as \u201cthe best of us\u201d and a man who modeled himself after his father.\n\nShe signaled that she\u2019ll offer a vigorous defense of Biden\u2019s qualifications on issues of race and civil rights, though she made headlines for assailing him for his past opposition to federally mandated bussing during a primary debate last year.\n\nNoting his own vice presidency under President Barack Obama, she said he \u201ctakes his place in the ongoing story of America\u2019s march towards equality and justice\u201d as the only person \u201cwho\u2019s served alongside the first black president and has chosen the first black woman as his running mate.\u201d\n\nHistoric or not, the event was not without its challenges. It started an hour late, and the high school gymnasium in which the candidates spoke lost its air conditioning after a power outage hit the area. While most of the cable news networks took the event live, the online livestream cut out just a few minutes into Biden\u2019s remarks.\n\nThe surreal nature of the scene was not only a woman of color stepping into the role that could carry her to the White House, but doing so in a mostly empty gym. Masked reporters nearly outnumbered campaign aides and the candidates\u2019 families members in a grim reminder of a coronavirus pandemic that has killed 165,000 Americans, while yielding Depression-level unemployment and World War II-level national deficits.\n\nIn any other presidential election, vice-presidential picks are greeted with adoring throngs, and Harris, given her profile, almost certainly could have expected an even more enthusiastic welcome to the ticket. On Wednesday, about 100 supporters stood outside the gymnasium waving signs prior to her arrival, with no hopes of being allowed inside.\n\nThe event was the first in a rollout that Biden aides say blends the historic nature of Harris\u2019 selection with the realities of the 2020 campaign and the gravity of the nation\u2019s circumstances. Later Wednesday, the pair were leading an online grassroots fundraiser. They will continue campaigning together through the Democrats\u2019 virtual convention that runs next Monday through Thursday.\n\nHarris was considered a favorite throughout Biden\u2019s search, and she\u2019s been a regular surrogate campaigner and fundraiser for him since he became the presumptive nominee.\n\nThey\u2019ll nonetheless have to paper over differences exposed during the primary campaign, from Harris\u2019 initial support for a single-payer health insurance system and the Green New Deal to her deeply personal debate-stage broadside against Biden over his opposition to federally mandated busing to integrate public schools in the 1970s.\n\nTrump has seized on those dynamics, tagging Harris as \u201cPhony Kamala\u201d and casting her as the latest evidence that Biden, a five-decade veteran of the Democratic establishment, is captive to his party\u2019s left flank.\n\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway on Wednesday insisted Harris is \u201cvery much part of the radical left\u201d and suggested the senator will have a hard time not outshining Biden, whose age and fitness for office Conway frequently mocks. \u201cHe\u2019s overshadowed basically by almost everyone he comes in contact with,\u201d she said.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign seemed prepared for the counteroffensive, noting that just weeks ago, Trump said Harris would be a \u201cfine choice.\u201d And campaign finance records show that Trump contributed as a private citizen to Harris\u2019 attorney general campaigns in California. Harris was elected to the Senate in 2016.\n\nHarris no longer supports a single-payer health insurance system, aligning instead with Biden\u2019s proposal to add a public insurance option to compete alongside private plans. Still, Harris memorably raised her hand during one Democratic primary debate when candidates were asked whether they could back a system that scrapped private health insurance altogether.\n\nShe has broadly endorsed the Green New Deal, progressives\u2019 most ambitious set of proposals to combat the climate crisis, but she didn\u2019t make that an anchor of her presidential bid. Biden has moved left on his climate proposals during the 2020 campaign but has not fully embraced the Green New Deal.\n\nIn Washington, Harris has advocated overhauling the criminal justice system, intensifying her efforts since George Floyd\u2019s killing by a white Minneapolis officer in May. And she\u2019s called for sweeping domestic programs to benefit the working and middle class. But she has taken heat for some of her aggressive stances as a local prosecutor in the San Francisco area and for not prosecuting bank executives in the wake of the 2008 financial collapse.\n\nThat mixed record could have unpredictable effects in a national campaign.\n\nBiden bets that, on balance, Harris has broad appeal that will shore up any weaknesses with Black women, an anchor of the Democratic Party, and other voters of color, while juicing turnout among white liberals and coaxing support from independents and Republican-leaning white voters who have soured on Trump.\n\nKaren Finney, a prominent Black strategist in the Democratic Party, pointed to immediate fundraising success as evidence that Biden\u2019s take on Harris is better than Trump\u2019s. Act Blue, Democrats\u2019 online fundraising arm, reported taking in almost $11 million in the hours after Biden\u2019s announcement, and the Biden campaign expected a massive haul from Wednesday evening\u2019s fundraiser, potentially rivaling previous events with Obama and former 2020 rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t get the visual,\u201d Finney said, referring to the realities of a coronavirus-era campaign. \u201cBut you can already feel the energy and excitement.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden retrieves his face mask from the podium as his running mate Sen.
