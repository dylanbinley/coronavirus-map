The medical community earlier called for stricter lockdown to ease the burden on the healthcare system from the huge spike in coronavirus cases.\n\nMetro Manila and the four areas were placed under more relaxed general community quarantine (GCQ) prior to the plea from the medical professionals.\n\nRoque earlier said extending the MECQ in the capital region and neighboring areas would be \u201chighly unlikely\u201d after the government ran out of funds for financial aid for sectors affected by the pandemic.\n\nHe said the government task force has made a recommendation on the quarantine level for other parts of the country, which is set to lapse on August 15.\n\n\u201cMayroon na pong recommendation for all other areas except Metro Manila the four provinces under MECQ. It is without prejudice that hanggang 15th lang ang all other areas,\u201d he said.\n\nThe GCQ status remained in effect in Batangas, Lapu-Lapu City, Mandaue City, Talisay City, municipalities of Minglanilla and Consolacion in Cebu, and Zamboanga City until August 15. The rest of the country is under the most relaxed modified general community quarantine (MGCQ) until mid-August.\n\nThe country has become the nation with highest coronavirus cases in Southeast Asia following recent spikes in the number of infections. As of August 12, more than 143,000 people have been infected with the coronavirus in the country. The country\u2019s death toll has soared to 2,404.\n\nLow fatality rate, increased testing efforts\n\nMalaca\u00f1ang has maintained that the country is doing a lot better in managing the coronavirus outbreak compared to other nations like the United States.\n\nAs testing, tracing and treatment efforts are escalated, Roque said the country still has a low COVID-19 mortality rate despite the increase in the cases of coronavirus. He also cited that severe and critical cases constitute 1.3 percent of the total cases of infections.\n\nRoque likewise trumpeted that the Philippines has the highest testing level in Southeast Asia with 1.7 million tests conducted as of this month.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of total cases per million population, ang Pilipinas ay mayroon lamang pong 1,272 infected per million at sa bilang na ito, 1.2% at 1.3% nga lang po ang severe at critical (On the basis of total cases per million population, the Philippines only has 1,272 infected per million and of this figure, 1.2% and 1.3% are severe and critical),\u201d he said.\n\nThe country\u2019s cases of infections have also not yet exceeded the hospital bed capacity, according to Roque. More quarantine and isolation facilities are being established to isolate and treat coronavirus patients.\n\n\u201cHindi po tayo nagkukulang ng mga bed capacity o iyong kakayahang magbigay ng medical attention sa mga nagkakasakit (We are not in shortage of bed capacity or capacity to give medical attention to the sick),\u201d he said.\n\nCiting data from the Department of Health, he said 55 percent of the 1,500 intensive care unit beds are occupied while 49 percent of the 11,500 isolation beds are in use. At least 51 percent of the 4,500 ward beds are occupied while 30 percent of the 2,100 ventilators are being used.\n\nHe said the country also proved wrong the University of the Philippines (UP) forecast about having 1.3 million to 3.5 million infections by end of June.\n\n\u201cAng pinakapatunay na we are able to manage COVID-19 ay naiwasan nga po natin ang UP forecast \u2018no na laging tumatama (A huge proof that we are able to manage COVID-19 is we avoided the UP forecast that is often correct),\u201d he said.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#25387A", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#25387A", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Manila Bulletin The Nation's Leading Newspaper", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Duterte to announce next quarantine level on August 17 - Manila Bulletin", "description": "The new community quarantine classification of Metro Manila and other areas will be known next week as the government continued to ramp up testing, tracing and treatment to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
