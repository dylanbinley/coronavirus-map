The Wagoneer, meantime, will go up against the upcoming 300 Series Toyota LandCruiser.\n\nWhile the new RAM pick-up is not produced in factory right-hand drive form, the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer are both expected to be global models sold in all key markets including SUV-mad Australia.\n\nFinally giving Jeep not one but two large three-row SUVs to also take on the Nissan Patrol, both models are expected to be offered in five-seat and seven-seat form (rather than the Wagoneer being five-seat and the Grand Wagoneer seven-seat).\n\nWith the Grand Wagoneer teaser campaign starting this week, Jeep\u2019s all-new flagship could be revealed within weeks.\n\nHowever, another all-new seven-seat Jeep will quickly follow in the form of the next-generation Grand Cherokee, which FCA plans to put into production in the third quarter of 2021. The first three-row Grand Cherokee will be joined by a more luxurious five-seat version.\n\nNaturally, the new Jeep Grand Cherokee \u2013 including the first seven-seat version \u2013 is a shoo-in for Australia, and both the Grand Wagoneer and Grand Cherokee are certain to eventually be offered in V8-powered SRT and even supercharged Trackhawk guises.\n\nHowever, when FCA first listed the new Grand Cherokee and all-new Grand Wagoneer in its 2018-2022 product plan, it said both models will be available with plug-in hybrid powertrains, which could come at the expense of diesel power in either big SUV.\n\nGiven production of the new Jeep Grand Cherokee is still a year away, there\u2019s still time for it to be tested in Australia, which we understand was the plan before the COVID-19 pandemic broke out this year.\n\nWhen we asked FCA Australia chief Kevin Flynn about the new Grand Cherokee, he said: \u201cThere\u2019s something we want to share with you in the coming weeks. We\u2019ve got a strategy for releasing information so we\u2019ll stick to that.\u201d\n\nFlynn said he didn\u2019t believe the Grand Cherokee name had been tarnished by the WK current model, which holds the dubious title of Australia\u2019s most recalled vehicle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re passionate about making sure that we deliver a quality product and without doubt we\u2019ve made massive strides there. The product that we sell today from a quality perspective is a very different product to some years back,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think Grand Cherokee right now in this stage of life cycle it\u2019s in is one hell of a great package. It\u2019s still got huge appeal. The styling tweaks that have been done over the years, the spec that\u2019s been added, it\u2019s still a great product and it still has appeal.\u201d\n\nJeep is preparing a third new seven-seat model, which could be the \u20183-row full-size SUV\u2019 it last month scheduled for production as soon as the first quarter of 2021 and the \u2018Low D 3-Row\u2019 that appeared in its previous 2018-2022 product plan. Whether this is a global model remains to be seen.\n\nAlso previously promised by 2022 was a new Jeep Cherokee mid-size SUV, a new Renegade small SUV and an all-new A/B-segment micro-SUV, all with PHEV power.\n\nJeep Australia has axed the Renegade, but Flynn hasn\u2019t ruled out a local return for Jeep\u2019s smallest existing SUV.\n\n\u201cCurrent generation Renegade just doesn\u2019t work for us, but that doesn\u2019t mean that future generations won\u2019t,\u201d he told carsales.\n\n\u201cIt uses very expensive componentry. The job it\u2019s supposed to do is one below Compass so in a sense it\u2019s almost too good for that. Never say never but it doesn\u2019t work for us right now.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "fb": {"app_id": 207120465991115, "admins": 100004682627394, "pages": 208393055860470}, "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://motoring.pxcrush.net/motoring/general/editorial/jeep_gc_interior_006.jpg?height=427&width=640&aspect=fitWithin", "secure_url": "https://motoring.pxcrush.net/motoring/general/editorial/jeep_gc_interior_006.jpg?height=427&width=640&aspect=fitWithin"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "New Jeep Grand Cherokee and Wagoneer coming - motoring.com.au", "description": "The official countdown has commenced for the all-new Jeep Grand Wagoneer, which will be the first of three new-generation seven-seat models to emerge from the US off-road auto brand over the next two years.
