By Thursday night, the blaze still threatened more than 5,400 homes and had charged through 17 square miles (44.5 square kilometers) of brush and forest land.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Press A burned vehicle rests along Pine Canyon Rd. as the Lake Fire burns in the Angeles National Forest, Calif., north of Santa Clarita on Thursday, Aug. 13, 2020.

It's one of several wildfires burning in the region.\n\nSeveral new fires erupted Thursday. The largest was near the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa. It burned nearly 4 square miles (10.13 square kilometers) of brush but was moving away from homes. However, some evacuations were ordered.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Press A firefighter works against the Lake Hughes fire in Angeles National Forest on Wednesday, Aug. 12, 2020, north of Santa Clarita, Calif.
