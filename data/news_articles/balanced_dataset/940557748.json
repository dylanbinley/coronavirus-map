Nelson.\n\n\u201cI have felt great sorrow about this pandemic,\u201d he wrote last week on social media. \u201cI have mourned with families who have lost loved ones. Many have lost jobs. Some have struggled to find adequate food and supplies.\u201d\n\nAmid the \u201cclouds of sorrow,\u201d though, Nelson has found \u201csilver linings.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany families have re-enthroned their homes as sanctuaries of faith,\u201d the 95-year-old church leader noted. \u201cMany better understand how important the family is and that it really is ordained of God, with an eternal destiny.\u201d\n\nNelson said Latter-day Saints can find relief from the \u201cfear, isolation and loss\u201d by turning their hearts to others. He pointed to the example of medical workers, farmers, pharmacists, truckers, grocers and others who \u201chave risked their own health to serve the urgent needs of others.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe road ahead may be bumpy, but our destination is serene and secure,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, fasten your seat belt, hang on through the bumps, and do what\u2019s right. Your reward will be eternal.\u201d\n\nThe priesthood ban from a global perspective\n\nIf the 1978 announcement removing the priesthood/temple ban on Black Latter-day Saints is seen in the context of U.S. political history of the 1960s and \u201970s, a historian said at the recent FAIRMormon Conference, \u201cthe timing of the revelation feels like a delayed response that was at best a decade late.\u201d\n\nIt makes much more sense, argued Ryan W. Saltzgiver of the church\u2019s History Department, to see the move as a response to the experience Latter-day Saint authorities were having outside the United States.\n\nThe historian pointed to the case of Eduardo Contieri of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, a convert who was called as president of the S\u00e3o Paulo Ipiranga Branch three months after joining the Utah-based faith in 1963. After doing some genealogy, Contieri discovered a picture of his maternal grandmother \u2014 whom he had never known \u2014 who appeared to be Black.\n\n\u201cHe immediately reported his discovery to the mission president,\u201d Saltzgiver said, and was told that he \u201cshould not use his priesthood to perform any public rituals and he would be released from his position as branch president, but he was allowed to continue to use the priesthood in private to bless his family.\u201d\n\nContieri remained in the faith and, in 1971, the governing First Presidency ruled that the photo evidence was insufficient to prove he was Black. So he was allowed to use his priesthood publicly again.\n\n\u201cIn 1973, five years before the priesthood ban was lifted, Contieri, a Latter-day Saint who self-identified as of African lineage,\u201d the historian explained, \u201caccepted the call to serve as bishop in the S\u00e3o Paulo First Ward.\u201d\n\nEncounters with Black Latter-day Saints like Contieri \u201ccoupled with the increasing impossibility of establishing a functional church structure globally,\u201d Saltzgiver said, \u201chad the most profound impact on [top Latter-day Saints leaders'] racial notions and sparked their desire to seek the revelation, which ultimately ended explicitly exclusionary racial practices.\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019re No. 3, Elder\u2019\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Salt Lake Tribune (Courtesy | MagicSpace/Broadway Across America) First National Tour Cast in the \"Book of Mormon\" musical.\n\nHello, what\u2019s this? The first song from the Tony-winning \u201cBook of Mormon\u201d has been voted the third best musical opening number of all time?\n\nYep. \u201cHello\u201d finished just behind \u201cWelcome to the Rock\u201d from \u201cCome From Away\u201d and \u201cAlexander Hamilton,\u201d the unsurprising top vote-getter, from \u201cHamilton,\u201d in a reader poll on the London-based WhatsOnStage website. \u201c\u2018Hello' placed ahead of \u201cCircle of Life\u201d from \u201cThe Lion King\u201d and \u201cNo One Mourns the Wicked\u201d from \u201cWicked.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it. Goodbye.\n\nThis week\u2019s podcast: A rabbi\u2019s life in Utah\u2019s Zion\n\n\u00a9 Trent Nelson (Trent Nelson | Tribune file photo) Cantor Wendy Bat-Sarah and Rabbi Samuel Spector at Congregation Kol Ami in Salt Lake City on Thursday, Oct. 3, 2019.\n\nRabbi Sam Spector of Congregation Kol Ami has been in Utah a little more than two years but has already built strong relationships with members and leaders of the state\u2019s predominant faith.\n\nJust last week, the 30-something rabbi was on hand to oversee a group of Latter-day Saint volunteers who spent five days working alongside Kol Ami congregants to xeriscape the Salt Lake City synagogue\u2019s six-acre plot.\n\nOn this week\u2019s podcast, the young and energetic rabbi discusses coming to Utah, meeting a Latter-day Saint apostle named \u201cJeff,\u201d traveling to Jerusalem with Brigham Young University professors and engaging in an interfaith dialogue that doesn\u2019t tiptoe around big differences. He also addresses why Christians doing Passover Seders can make him uncomfortable and who uses the term \u201cZion\u201d more \u2014 Latter-day Saints or Jews.\n\nListen here.\n\nA \u2018giant\u2019 of Mormon literature\n\nFans of Maurine Whipple, author of \u201cThe Giant Joshua,\u201d the landmark 1941 novel about early Mormon settlers in southern Utah, can take heart: You\u2019ll soon be able to read more of her writings.\n\nBy Common Consent Press will be publishing \u201cA Craving for Beauty: The Lost Works of Maurine Whipple.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe volume contains over 450 pages of literary work by Maurine in her prime,\u201d co-editors Andrew Hall and Lynne Larson write in a BCC blog post, \u201cmost of which has never been published, including over 200 pages from \u201cCleave the Wood,\u201d her planned sequel to \u201cThe Giant Joshua.\u201d\n\nIn a buildup to the new release, the BCC Late Summer Book Club will be reading \u2014 and, for many members, rereading \u2014 \u201cThe Giant Joshua.\u201d\n\nClosing the \u2018gender gap\u2019 in church history\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Salt Lake Tribune (Courtesy photo) Scholar Melissa Inouye\n\nThe church\u2019s \u201cGlobal Histories\u201d project is collecting stories of female and male Latter-day Saints from around the world and working especially hard to highlight women\u2019s voices.\n\nMelissa Inouye, a historian in the church\u2019s History Department, discussed the undertaking at FairMormon\u2019s recent virtual 2020 conference.\n\nInouye urged attendees to \u201cfind and magnify women\u2019s words and voices in lessons, talks, conversations. ... Notice situations where women\u2019s voices, talents and perspectives are weirdly absent. If you see something, say something.\u201d\n\n\u2018Elders\u2019 Biden and Trump\n\nJoe Biden and Donald Trump are seeking to convert Latter-day Saints to their respective presidential campaigns.\n\nVice President Mike Pence traveled to Mesa this week to help launch a new coalition, Latter-day Saints for Trump, and shore up the usually reliably Republican LDS voting bloc in the battleground state of Arizona.\n\n\u201cOn issues most important to people of faith across this country \u2014 issues like life and religious liberty \u2014 Joe Biden and the radical left are deeply out of step with the American people,\u201d Pence argued. \u201cI\u2019m proud to tell you, though, this president has stood for the religious freedom of every American of every faith every day of this administration.\u201d\n\nA Utah lawmaker attended the launch party for the new coalition.\n\n\u201cSo much about President Trump and Vice President Pence\u2019s agenda [is] consistent with and crucial to some of the things that matter most to Latter-day Saints: faith, family, freedom, pro-life and religious liberty,\u201d Rep. Kim Coleman, R-West Jordan, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural coalition, and I\u2019m sure it will grow and have an impact on this election. I\u2019m excited to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nBut Rob Taber, national co-chairman of LDS Democrats of America, believes that fellow church members are looking for a candidate who suits their values and that Biden should be their choice.\n\nAnd Joshua Dickson, the national faith engagement director for the Biden campaign, told The Salt Lake Tribune that \u201cLatter-day Saints see strong contrast between Vice President Biden\u2019s family-first, opportunity-focused agenda and President Trump\u2019s continued attempts to separate children from their parents, put kids in cages, abuse his power, deny refuge to the stranger, and normalize racism and incivility.\u201d\n\nWhile polls show most U.S. Latter-day Saints vote Republican and back Trump, many remain uncomfortable with his personal behavior and his combative political style.\n\nMother in Heaven\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Salt Lake Tribune (File photo illustration by Amy Lewis | The Salt Lake Tribune)\n\nJournalist Richard Ostling explores and explains the church\u2019s evolving belief in a Heavenly Mother in a recent GetReligion piece.\n\nThis doctrine, he writes, is \u201ca wholly unique aspect of the LDS faith.\u201d\n\nOstling quotes a church Gospel Topics essay, which concedes that \u201cour present knowledge about a Mother in Heaven is limited.\u201d\n\n\u201cNevertheless,\u201d the essay adds, \u201cwe have been given sufficient knowledge to appreciate the sacredness of this doctrine and to comprehend the divine pattern established for us as children of heavenly parents.\u201d\n\nOstling also points to a 2013 Times and Seasons blog post by Rachel Whipple that calls Mother in Heaven \u201cthe dark side of the moon, the substantial half of God as yet hidden from the searchlight of institutional revelation and the strictures of correlated curriculum.\u201d\n\nAnother BYU petition\n\nThere\u2019s a new petition circulating among BYU students. This one isn\u2019t seeking to change the Honor Code, boost racial awareness or rename certain buildings on the Provo campus.\n\nNo, this latest online petition is urging church-owned BYU to put greater emphasis on Christ in the curriculum and has gained thousands of signatures.\n\n\u201cCertain official actions taken by BYU have been out of accord with the clearly stated principles of the gospel, to the point where the church has had to issue corrections. While we are grateful to our church leaders for exercising authority to correct BYU where necessary, we do not believe it should ever have to come to that,\u201d students Hanna Seariac and Tristan Mourier write on Change.org. \u201c...We do not believe that the university should trade the eternal life of its students for the praise and accolades of modern, secular academia.\u201d\n\nThe petition\u2019s advocates have come under fire, reports BYU\u2019s student newspaper, The Daily Universe.\n\n\u201cThey continue to say that BYU is not currently fulfilling its mission statement \u2018to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life,\u2019\u201d student Grace Soelberg tweeted. \u201c...How is BYU helping its students to reach eternal life if it does not help them to root out their implicit bias and internalized racism?\u201d\n\nTemple updates\n\n\u2022 Good news for missionaries serving in Utah who never had the chance to be endowed \u2014 due to coronavirus-related closures \u2014 and for those prospective proselytizers in the state waiting to leave for their fields of service: They\u2019ll soon be able to go to the temple for their endowments.\n\nThe church announced that 17 more temples \u2014 10 of them in Utah \u2014 will expand their operations under Phase 2 guidelines next week to allow \u201call temple ordinances for living individuals,\u201d including the newly altered endowment. A total of 29 temples will have entered Phase 2.\n\nIn addition, three more temples will reopen under Phase 1 \u2014 offering marriage \u201csealings\u201d only \u2014 putting 130 of the faith\u2019s 168 temples back in service.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Salt Lake Tribune (Rendering courtesy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) The San Pedro Sula Temple in Honduras.\n\n\u2022 A groundbreaking has been set for Sept. 5 to begin work on the San Pedro Sula Temple, which will become Honduras\u2019 second temple.\n\n\u2022 Later, on Sept. 26, a groundbreaking is scheduled for the Bras\u00edlia Temple. The single-story, 25,000-square-foot edifice will be Brazil\u2019s 11th either operational or announced temple.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Salt Lake Tribune (Rendering courtesy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Bras\u00edlia Temple in Brazil.\n\n\u2022 The church has posted a YouTube video that talks about \u201cTemples Through Time.\u201d It includes remarks from apostle David A. Bednar, scholars, ministers of other faiths and rank-and-file Latter-day Saints from across the globe.\n\nReplay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Skip Ad\n\nQuote of the week\n\n\u201cThe problem with home church is that it means licking the frosting off the cake, week after week. It\u2019s fantastic, but we also need spiritual fiber, fresh vegetables and whole grains. It\u2019s too easy for me as an individual or us as a family to focus on our favorite topics and avoid what we don\u2019t want to hear. Eventually, even the best intentioned of us will start to drift into our own favored side currents. Home church doesn\u2019t challenge us with the gospel of Jesus Christ as filtered through the experience and perception of another human being.\u201d\n\nJonathan Green, in a Times and Seasons blog post\n\nMormon Land is a weekly newsletter written by David Noyce and Peggy Fletcher Stack.
