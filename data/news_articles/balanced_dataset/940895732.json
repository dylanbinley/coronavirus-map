This was seen as Pakistan challenging the Kingdom's leadership of OIC.\n\nThis was not taken well by Saudi Arabia which is the biggest source of remittance income to Pakistan's falling economy, and also one of its largest creditors.\n\nIt is in this light that Bajwa has decided to fly to Saudi Arabia to undo the damage caused by Qureshi's threat.", "METADATA": {"author": "Swarajya Staff", "news_keywords": "Kashmir,Pakistan Military,Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa,Saudi Kingdom,Qureshi", "title": "Pakistan Army Chief To Fly To Saudi Arabia To Undo The Damage Caused By Foreign Minister Qureshi's Threat To Kingdom", "keywords": "Kashmir,Pakistan Military,Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa,Saudi Kingdom,Qureshi", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://swarajyamag.com/insta/pakistan-army-chief-to-visit-saudi-arabia-to-undo-the-damage-caused-by-foreign-minister-qureshis-threat-to-kingdom", "title": "Pakistan Army Chief To Visit Saudi Arabia To Undo The Damage Caused By Foreign Minister Qureshi's Threat To Kingdom", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.assettype.com/swarajya%2F2018-03%2F82c0fa31-dffe-4f90-b963-241f5e3aee6c%2Fb780ac0e-39b0-4fa2-9118-da25aed2bd59.jpg?w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true", "width": 1200}, "site_name": "Swarajyamag", "description": "Saudi Arabia is the biggest creditor, as well as biggest source of remittance income to Pakistan's falling economy."}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Pakistan Army Chief To Visit Saudi Arabia To Undo The Damage Caused By Foreign Minister Qureshi's Threat To Kingdom", "image": "https://images.assettype.com/swarajya%2F2018-03%2F82c0fa31-dffe-4f90-b963-241f5e3aee6c%2Fb780ac0e-39b0-4fa2-9118-da25aed2bd59.jpg?w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true", "site": "SwarajyaMag", "description": "Saudi Arabia is the biggest creditor, as well as biggest source of remittance income to Pakistan's falling economy."}, "description": "Saudi Arabia is the biggest creditor, as well as biggest source of remittance income to Pakistan's falling economy.", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/icons/fav/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
