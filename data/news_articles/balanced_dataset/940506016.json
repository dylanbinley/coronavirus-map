Greek Ministry of Defence/Handout via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS PICTURE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY\n\nATHENS (Reuters) - The French military conducted training exercises with Greek forces off the southern island of Crete on Thursday, defence sources said, as tension persisted with Turkey over disputed waters in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThursday\u2019s exercise was the first manifestation of French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s commitment to temporarily reinforce his country\u2019s presence in the eastern Mediterranean. France has called on Turkey to halt oil and gas exploration in disputed waters.\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis discussed the situation in the region with Macron by telephone on Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, the French armed forces ministry said it was sending two Rafale fighter jets and the naval frigate \u2018Lafayette\u2019 to the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThe frigate and the jets had arrived in Crete earlier on Thursday and carried out joint manoeuvres with Greek forces, the Greek defence sources said.\n\n\u201cEmmanuel Macron is a true friend of Greece and a fervent defender of European values and international law,\u201d Mitsotakis tweeted, in French, after the call with Macron.\n\nTensions have simmered between NATO allies Greece and Turkey in recent days over overlapping claims to hydrocarbon resources in Mediterranean waters.\n\nA Turkish seismic vessel, the Oruc Reis, has been sailing between Crete and Cyprus since Monday, despatched by Ankara days after Greece signed a maritime deal with Egypt designating an exclusive economic zone between the two nations.\n\nTurkey says it plans to open up some of the area for potential hydrocarbon exploration, and a precursor to that is collecting seismic data it can process and sell to potential bidders. Both countries lay claim to the area.", "METADATA": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "middle-east", "DCSext.ChannelList": "middle-east;worldNews;everythingNews;UK-The-Wire;UKWire_EL", "description": "The French military conducted training exercises with Greek forces off the southern island of Crete on Thursday, defence sources said, as tension persisted with Turkey over disputed waters in the eastern Mediterranean.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "UK,GREECE,TURKEY,FRANCE,Defense,South,Eastern Europe,Western Europe,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,North Atlantic Treaty Organization,Greece,France,European Union,General News,Cyprus,Europe,Middle East,International / National Security,Conflicts / War / Peace,Turkey", "news_keywords": "UK;GREECE;TURKEY;FRANCE;Defense;South;Eastern Europe;Western Europe;Diplomacy / Foreign Policy;North Atlantic Treaty Organization;Greece;France;European Union;General News;Cyprus;Europe;Middle East;International / National Security;Conflicts / War / Peace;Turkey", "REVISION_DATE": "Thu Aug 13 17:28:30 UTC 2020", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2020-08-13T17:28:30+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-greece-turkey-france-idUKKCN25914B", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Amid tensions with Turkey, Greece in joint manoeuvres with France", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.K.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "UK,GREECE,TURKEY,FRANCE,Defense,South,Eastern Europe,Western Europe,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,North Atlantic Treaty Organization,Greece,France,European Union,General News,Cyprus,Europe,Middle East,International / National Security,Conflicts / War / Peace,Turkey", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "UK-GREECE-TURKEY-FRANCE", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "Slideshow", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Amid tensions with Turkey, Greece in joint manoeuvres with France", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2020-08-13T17:28:30+0000", "sailthru.title": "Amid tensions with Turkey, Greece in joint manoeuvres with France", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "U.K.", "title": "Amid tensions with Turkey, Greece in joint manoeuvres with France", "url": "https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-greece-turkey-france-idUKKCN25914B", "type": "article", "description": "The French military conducted training exercises with Greek forces off the southern island of Crete on Thursday, defence sources said, as tension persisted with Turkey over disputed waters in the eastern Mediterranean.", "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200813&t=2&i=1529487195&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7C0XP", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T17:28:30+0000", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T17:28:30+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "UK,GREECE,TURKEY,FRANCE,Defense,South,Eastern Europe,Western Europe,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,North Atlantic Treaty Organization,Greece,France,European Union,General News,Cyprus,Europe,Middle East,International / National Security,Conflicts / War / Peace,Turkey"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ReutersUK"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ReutersUK", "creator": "@ReutersUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Amid tensions with Turkey, Greece in joint manoeuvres with France", "description": "The French military conducted training exercises with Greek forces off the southern island of Crete on Thursday, defence sources said, as tension persisted with Turkey over disputed waters in the eastern Mediterranean.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200813&t=2&i=1529487195&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7C0XP", "src": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200813&t=2&i=1529487195&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7C0XP"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "uk.reuters/world/middleeast/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Home", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}}}
