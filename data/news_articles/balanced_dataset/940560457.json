Among them have been representatives from Kenya, Egypt, Ethiopia, China and Taiwan.\n\nEach country sent representatives to try and win Hargeisa\u2019s cause to its side of tiffs, in moves which point to an increasingly more adept administration in the breakaway region.\n\nEthiopia\u2019s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent representatives to try and undo a growing relationship between Hargeisa and Cairo, which could see the two open representative offices in each other\u2019s capitals and could give Cairo a military foothold in the Horn. Ethiopia and Egypt are at daggers drawn over the management of water from the Nile River.\n\nKenya\u2019s former prime minister and opposition leader, Raila Odinga, also sent representatives to Hargeisa, in what analysts view as another growing dispute between Nairobi and Mogadishu. Kenyan troops are in Somalia to fight against the threat of the Islamist militants of Al-Shabaab.\n\nNairobi is particularly important to Somaliland\u2019s cause after Kenya won a United Nations Security Council seat in a competition that revealed the broad lines of geopolitics in East Africa. Djibouti, the home of foreign military bases vital, received support from Somalia and other countries.\n\nAttracting Asian attention\n\nGlobally, Somaliland\u2019s growing relationship with Taiwan immediately attracted Beijing\u2019s attention, as it would give Taipei a foothold in the Horn, as well as on the continent. eSwatini is the only state on the continent that currently recognises Taiwan.\n\nREAD MORE Somalia: Ahead of polls, parliament votes Prime Minister Khaire out\n\nIn late June, China and Somalia agreed to conduct joint naval patrols in the Red Sea. Regional analysts says as a front in both their interests in curbing Somaliland\u2019s growing geopolitical importance. A few weeks later, China sent its ambassador to Somalia, Qin Jian, to Hargeisa. According to local media reports, he failed to meet President Bihi, whose discussions with Taiwan are at an advanced stage and could see Somaliland hosting a Taiwanese military base and a representative office.\n\nAt a follow up meeting on 6 August, where ambassador Jian showed up with other high-level diplomats from Beijing, China agreed to finance multiple development projects and open a liaison office in Hargeisa on condition that Bihi severs talks with Taiwan.\n\nChinese ambassador to Somalia went to Somaliland to meet Prez Bihi. As soon as he started putting on the \"warrior diplomacy\" act & threatening Somaliland, Bihi stood up and gave him marching orders. A few hours later Bihi instructed his MFA to begin process to recognise Taiwan. pic.twitter.com/XVdWG8KBmF \u2014 Rashid Abdi (@RAbdiCG) August 4, 2020\n\nThese moves in July and August follow a resumption of talks between Hargeisa and Mogadishu in neighbouring Djibouti in mid-June, which followed a meeting brokered by Ethiopia\u2019s Prime Minister Abiy in February.\n\nDaily newsletter: join our 100 000 subscribers!

Both Somalia\u2019s President Mohammed Farmaajo and Ethiopia\u2019s Abiy are currently engaged in political manoeuvres at home, and the Somalia-Somaliland talks may no longer be on their main to-do lists.\n\nREAD MORE Somalia: The dawning of a new era of oil exploration\n\n\u201cSomalia can\u2019t engage significantly over the next few months,\u201d Omar Mahmood, International Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst for Somalia, tells The Africa Report, \u201cso Somaliland\u2019s is embedding its engagement in external competitive frameworks such as Ethiopia/Egypt, Taiwan/China.\u201d\n\nThe effectiveness of exploiting \u2018external competitive frameworks\u2019 is, however, in question unless it can bring the two sides back to the table or at least keep them there for the smaller, technical issues.\n\nAccording to commentary by International Crisis Group, the Djibouti meeting in June, the first such direct talks in six years, was due to Abiy\u2019s pressure as well as \u201ca sustained push from the US, which together with the EU was also trying to facilitate a return to the table.\u201d\n\nThe article continues below Free download Get your free PDF: Top 500 african companies 2019 Your guide to Africa's leading corporates Complete the form for your free download of The Africa Report\u2019s 2019 Exclusive Ranking of Africa\u2019s top 500 companies from last year.

In 2018, Farmaajo\u2019s government in Mogadishu rejected a previous arrangement that allowed aid to flow directly to Somaliland; in 2019, it assumed airspace control from the International Civil Aviation Organisation. \u201cThis move reversed a previously negotiated plan that would have established a joint regulatory body in Somaliland\u2019s capital, with Hargeisa and Mogadishu sharing the revenues accruing from overflights,\u201d International Crisis Group analysts noted in August commentary.\n\nWhere to now?\n\nIt is unlikely that the Somalia-Somaliland talks will resume until 2021 and there\u2019s a real possibility that there could be new leaders and governments on both sides. While analysts view the political question of Somaliland\u2019s sovereignty as difficult to solve now even if talks were to resume, they point out that there are key technical issues that could still be resolved to avoid the attendant crises in airspace management, international aid flow, and security management.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "As the Horn of Africa nears its elections seasons, Somaliland\u2019s quest for statehood takes regional and international angles.", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.theafricareport.com/media/2020/08/RTX6ETIJ.jpg", "width": 732, "height": 422}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Somaliland plays up its geopolitical role, courting China and Taiwan", "description": "As the Horn of Africa nears its elections seasons, Somaliland\u2019s quest for statehood takes regional and international angles.", "url": "https://www.theafricareport.com/37463/somaliland-plays-up-its-geopolitical-role-courting-china-and-taiwan/", "site_name": "The Africa Report.com", "updated_time": "2020-08-13T14:42+00:00"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T14:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T14:42+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Somaliland plays up its geopolitical role, courting China and Taiwan", "description": "As the Horn of Africa nears its elections seasons, Somaliland\u2019s quest for statehood takes regional and international angles.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.theafricareport.com/media/2020/08/RTX6ETIJ.jpg", "width": 732, "height": 422}}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/media/2019/03/cropped-theafricareport-icon-square-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#0078e1"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
