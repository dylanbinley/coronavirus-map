An autopsy determined that Remus Sr. had been strangled with the rope, investigators said.\n\nKuybus said her family believes her grandfather was robbed because all his jewelry was missing as was his wallet.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what makes us believe he was robbed and his wallet was thrown out and money missing!\u201d Kuybus said in her email.\n\nRemus Sr.\u2019s wallet, a hair tie wrapped around cash, several cards and is identification was found a month later in the area of Highbanks Road and Sanctuary Avenue in DeBary, investigarors noted in their report.\n\nSheriff\u2019s detectives said they learned that Robert Remus Jr. and his father had gone out boating on Dec. 8, 2012, and that his father was not seen after that day.\n\nWhen Remus Jr. was first questioned, he told deputies his father was probably out of the country, either in Belize or Costa Rica because his father owned property overseas, a report shows.\n\nRemus Jr. told deputies his father had many enemies because he was a \u201cshrewd businessman,\u201d a charging document states.\n\nRemus Jr. also told deputies that he wanted his father to sell his Costa Rica property for $2 million but that his father wanted to sell it for a higher price, reports indicate.\n\nAfter executing a search warrant, deputies found Remus, Sr.\u2019s will, which listed Remus, Jr. as the executor of his estate, as well as power of attorney, investigators said.\n\nDeputies learned that Remus Jr. told workers remodeling a home of his father\u2019s not to go to his father\u2019s home because he was sick with the flu, investigators said.\n\nDetectives also discovered that Remus Jr. used his father\u2019s cellphone days after he was last seen and even after the father\u2019s body was found, the report said.\n\nDeputies then spoke to the son of the girlfriend of Remus Sr., who told investigators that Remus Jr. became paranoid after his father\u2019s body was discovered. He said Remus Jr. spoke of how investigators put cameras in trees and were following him because they were looking for him in connection with his father\u2019s death, the report detailed.\n\nIn a second interview, Remus Jr. told detectives that while out on the boat ride on Dec. 8, 2012, they talked about his father\u2019s affairs in case of his death, the report outlined.\n\nRemus Jr. also said the white and blue rope found around his father\u2019s neck belonged to him, and he kept asking detectives what video evidence they had, deputies said.\n\nRemus Jr. described the boat ride as somber and when asked about his father\u2019s killing, he said he believed detectives thought maybe he \u201csnapped\u201d but said that was not his \u201cstyle\u201d because he did not have a \u201cmean bone in his body,\u201d investigators said.\n\nBut deputies said they believe Remus Jr. killed his father for money.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that Remus, Jr. had significant financial gain after Remus, Sr.\u2019s death, as per family account he was awarded thousands of dollars after Remus, Sr.\u2019s assets were liquidated via probate court,\u201d sheriff\u2019s investigators wrote in their report.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "DeBary man who got inheritance arrested in river killing of father", "description": "A DeBary man killed his father while out on a boat ride eight years ago, deputies say, to collect money left behind...", "url": "https://www.news-journalonline.com/story/news/crime/2020/08/12/debary-man-who-got-inheritance-arrested-in-river-killing-of-father/113145048/", "site_name": "Daytona Beach News-Journal Online", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d1527f8d4e93205223ba6d7be38fab3ab0a339a4/c=0-165-480-435/local/-/media/2020/08/13/DaytonaBeach/ghows-LK-200819663-9ce1ec4a.jpg?width=480&height=270&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 480, "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Patricio G.
