Traditionally, in north Poland, work is less advanced with about 65-70% harvested.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn many regions, the quality parameters of this year\u2019s wheat are quite decent. Most wheat meets milling criteria.\u201d\n\nTraders estimate this year\u2019s British wheat crop will fall about 35% on 2019 to around 10.0 million to 10.5 million tonnes after plantings were cut.\n\nBritain\u2019s wheat harvest was 47% complete on Tuesday, following rapid progress during the preceding fortnight, said the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board.\n\n\u201cMost regions had begun harvesting winter wheat with conditions mostly favourable,\u201d the board said.
