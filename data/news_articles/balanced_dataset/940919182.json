Japan says the issue was resolved by the 1965 economic cooperation pact that normalized diplomatic ties with South Korea.\n\nAlthough Abe refrained from visiting controversial Yasukuni Shrine, where Class-A war criminals are honored along with the war dead, four Cabinet members \u2014 Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, internal affairs minister Sanae Takaichi, education minister Koichi Hagiuda and state minister for Okinawa and the Northern Territories Seiichi Eto \u2014 did.\n\nIt was the first time in four years for Cabinet ministers to make official visits to the shrine on the anniversary of Japan's surrender.\n\nSouth Korea and China both view the shrine as a symbol of Japan\u2019s past militarism.", "METADATA": {"verify-v1": "+h35BdFddo/f1upXot92yGKSB4d5EuWWGbARz9SJE6A=", "twitter": {"account_id": 7424642, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/np_file_30986-870x489.jpeg", "site": "@japantimes", "creator": "@japantimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Japan Times", "robots": "noodp", "author": "Satoshi Sugiyama", "article": {"author": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/author/satoshi-sugiyama/", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thejapantimes", "tag": "covid-19 in Japan"}, "thumbnail": "https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/np_file_30986-200x200.jpeg", "description": "A minute of silence was observed to remember the estimated 3 million Japanese who perished in World War II, as the emperor and prime minister paid their respects.", "keywords": "China, Shinzo Abe, WWII, U.S., North Korea, South Korea, Cabinet, Shinjiro Koizumi, Emperor Naruhito, covid-19, covid-19 in Japan", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Japan marks 75th surrender anniversary in solemn ceremony thinned by pandemic", "description": "A minute of silence was observed to remember the estimated 3 million Japanese who perished in World War II, as the emperor and prime minister paid their respects.", "url": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/08/15/national/75th-anniversary-wwii-surrender/", "site_name": "The Japan Times", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/np_file_30986-870x1303.jpeg", "width": 870, "height": 1303}}, "fb": {"app_id": 119406745111}, "DC.date.issued": "2020-08-15T21:06:07+09:00"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": true, "NOTES": true}}
