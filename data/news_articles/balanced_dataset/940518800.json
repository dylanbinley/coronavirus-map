Belarusian Investigative Committee addressed the citizens asking for assistance in search for coordinators of actions of participants of mass disturbances, the BelTA news agency reported on Thursday, quoting the representatives of the investigative agency.\n\nThe committee also reported that \"there were people planted in the crowd who were instigating the violence against the law enforcement officials thus provoking the implementation of forceful measures while they themselves during these actions were walking away from the sites of confrontation between the citizens and the riot police.\"\n\nIn that respect, the Investigative Committee addressed the eyewitnesses of these events. \"If you have video footage or photographs of these individuals or if you possess the information important for the investigation on the identities of instigators and coordinators, please report this to the operative duty services of the Minsk directorate of the Investigative Committee,\" the committee noted. \"Only together we are able to stop the mass turmoil, to ensure security for everyone and to bring back peace to our native land,\" the agency said.\n\nThe presidential election was held in Belarus on August 9.
