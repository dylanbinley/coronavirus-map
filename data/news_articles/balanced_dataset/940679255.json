They said the community supported the rule of law and immediate release of missing persons.\n\nThey said that the community was in a shock and dismayed because they never took up arms against the state, while they also never did anything against national security. Despite their \u201cpatriotism and huge services for Pakistan\u201d, they said that the officials treated them as though they had violated national security.\n\nInnocent youths of the community and notables, they said, were suffering due to \u201cbiased mindset\u201d. The affected families, parties, scholars, notables and other community leaders had been running a peaceful joint campaign to seek justice.\n\nThey also referred to a past meeting with President Dr Arif Alvi with the families of the missing persons where they were assured of immediate action on their demand. But, they said, no effort had been made by the government so far for the justice and safe recovery of their loved ones. They said that the family members of the missing persons were extremely concerned over the prolonged disappearance of their relatives and urged the government to ensure their release or production in court if they had violated any law.\n\nThey also said victims of the enforced disappearances also enjoyed fundamental rights as human beings and as citizens of Pakistan. They recalled that they had been asking the authorities to produce these detainees in court if they have any formal charges filed against them.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 14th, 2020", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "subject": "Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.", "description": "KARACHI: The Joint Action Committee for Shia Missing Persons on Wednesday announced a protest demonstration on ...", "fb": {"app_id": 1383068068604634, "pages": 86398345441}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "DAWN.COM", "url": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1574226", "type": "article", "title": "Families of \u2018missing persons\u2019 to protest in front of Governor House on Sunday", "description": "KARACHI: The Joint Action Committee for Shia Missing Persons on Wednesday announced a protest demonstration on ...", "image": "https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/08/5f35a2536e8ec.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@dawn_com", "url": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1574226", "title": "Families of \u2018missing persons\u2019 to protest in front of Governor House on Sunday", "description": "KARACHI: The Joint Action Committee for Shia Missing Persons on Wednesday announced a protest demonstration on ...", "image": "https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/08/5f35a2536e8ec.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.dawn.com", "published_time": "2020-08-14 07:03:33", "modified_time": "2020-08-14 07:03:33", "author": "https://www.dawn.com/authors/397/the-newspaper-s-staff-reporter"}, "author": "The Newspaper's Staff Reporter"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
