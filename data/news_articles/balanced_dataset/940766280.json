Medical personnel qualify in combat arms once every 36 months by firing 100 rounds with the M4 carbine using both iron sights and red dot sights, said Tech. Sgt. Matthew Nunemaker, a CATM instructor for the 910th Security Forces Squadron.\n\nAir Force medical professionals are considered noncombatants under the Geneva Conventions, said Master Sgt. Hector Mendez, the health services supervisor for the 910th MDS. However, not every enemy plays by the rules. If our medical Airmen are engaged by enemies, they need to defend not only themselves but those under their care as well.\n\nThe 910th MDS provides manpower augmentation for medical support of Expeditionary Air Force activities for theater hospitals and medical treatment facilities. This support takes the form of triage, treatment and patient stabilization for transport while in combat zones. During peacetime, the 910th MDS provides support to YARS through immunizations, physical examinations and pre and post-deployment medical screenings.", "METADATA": {"REVISIT-AFTER": "1 DAYS", "RATING": "GENERAL", "RESOURCE-TYPE": "DOCUMENT", "DESCRIPTION": "While many medical professionals around the world are busy combating COVID-19, the medical professionals at Youngstown Air Reserve Station are training on defending themselves from more traditional foes.,", "KEYWORDS": "youngstown air reserve station, youngstown ars, youngstown, 910th airlift wing, 910aw, 910th aw, 910 aw, air force reserve command, afrc", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "host": "DMA Public Web", "contact": "pubwebhd@defense.gov", "twitter": {"site": "@USairforce", "creator": "@USairforce", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "910th MDS receives combat arms training", "description": "While many medical professionals around the world are busy combating COVID-19, the medical professionals at Youngstown Air Reserve Station are training on defending themselves from more traditional", "image": "https://media.defense.gov/2020/Aug/06/2002472159/825/780/0/200801-F-UU934-1359.JPG"}, "og": {"url": "https://www.youngstown.afrc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2303464/910th-mds-receives-combat-arms-training/", "title": "910th MDS receives combat arms training", "description": "While many medical professionals around the world are busy combating COVID-19, the medical professionals at Youngstown Air Reserve Station are training on defending themselves from more traditional", "site_name": "Youngstown Air Reserve Station", "image": "https://media.defense.gov/2020/Aug/06/2002472159/825/780/0/200801-F-UU934-1359.JPG", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
