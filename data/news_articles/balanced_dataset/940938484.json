This is about the UAE, Israel and the United States,\u201d Anwar Gargash, UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, said in a phone interview, according to Reuters.\n\n\u201cThis is in no way meant to create some sort of grouping against Iran.\u201d\n\nWhile the Trump administration and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have sought to frame the agreement as part of their attempt to confront and further isolate Iran, Gargash claimed that the UAE isn\u2019t looking to provoke its near neighbor.\n\n\u201cWe have a very complicated relationship with Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile we have our concerns, we feel also that resolving these issues should be through diplomacy and de-escalation.\u201d\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday said Turkey could withdraw its ambassador to the UAE over the country\u2019s agreement with Israel, saying it dealt a blow to Palestinian rights. Gargash dismissed the statement as a \u201cdouble standard\u201d which glossed over Turkey\u2019s own significant trade links with Israel.\n\n\u201cThey receive over half a million Israeli tourists, have $2 billion worth of bilateral trade and an existing embassy there. And I ask myself whether this is a principled position or not,\u201d Gargash said.\n\nUnder the deal, Israel agreed to put aside for now its pledge to annex West Bank land the Palestinians want for a state. \u201cWe have been very concerned with the issue of annexation,\u201d Gargash said. \u201cThrough this imaginative proclamation, we have at least been able to give negotiations space.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1,,minimum-scale=1", "description": "TEHRAN (Tasnim) \u2013 The United Arab Emirates said its decision to normalize ties with Israel isn\u2019t about countering Iran, and dismissed criticism of the pact from Turkey\u2019s president.", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "UAE Says Pact Not about Confronting Iran, Rejects Erdogan Threat - World news - Tasnim News Agency", "description": "TEHRAN (Tasnim) \u2013 The United Arab Emirates said its decision to normalize ties with Israel isn\u2019t about countering Iran, and dismissed criticism of the pact from Turkey\u2019s president.", "site_name": "Tasnim News Agency", "article": {"author": "Tasnim News Agency"}, "url": "/en/news/2020/08/15/2327940/uae-says-pact-not-about-confronting-iran-rejects-erdogan-threat", "image": "https://newsmedia.tasnimnews.com/Tasnim/Uploaded/Image/1398/02/26/1398022613053596517433554.jpg"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
