You can't have peace and annexation at the same time.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the UAE wants to push forward on normalization with Israel \"as soon as possible\", Gargash said. \u201cI see teams meeting in order to address many of the areas of interest in Israel and in the UAE.\u201d\n\nGargash specified that the fields the UAE wanted cooperate with Israel on included agriculture, food security, cyber security, tourism, technology and trade.\n\n'Mossad chief to lead delegation to UAE next week'\n\nAn Israeli delegation is reportedly about to travel to the United Arab Emirates early next week to meet with the Persian Gulf state\u2019s top leaders.\n\nIsrael's Channel 12 television said a senior Israeli official would lead the team. The Ynet news site said this would be the director of Mossad spy agency, Yossi Cohen, who is said to have led normalization bids over the past year.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s office said in a statement that Israel's national security adviser, Meir Ben-Shabbat, would lead preparations for the talks \u201cin coordination with all the relevant parties.\u201d\n\nChannel 12 said some aspects of the normalization agreement may be signed during the visit. The two sides would also schedule a meeting between Emirati and Israeli leaders to take place within the next few weeks.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said on Thursday he believed a deal-signing ceremony could take place at the White House in about three weeks.\n\nIn his interview, Gargash stressed that his country\u2019s normalization deal with Israel was not a symbolic measure, and that Abu Dhabi wanted wide-ranging bilateral relations with Israel.\n\nThe agreement, he said, would involve opening embassies and that he hoped cultural exchanges would begin taking place \u201csoon\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is not something we are talking about being gradual, we need to get things moving, we need to start, so I hope soon and Israel is going to be part of Expo Dubai, so clearly this is important that we also see Israeli visitors coming to Dubai,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Thursday, the UAE, Israel and the US issued a joint statement announcing an agreement on \u201cthe full normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates\u201d.\n\nThe Emirates presented the move as an achievement for West Bank Palestinians, in that it halts Israel\u2019s plans to annex parts of the territory, but Palestinians castigated the new accord as \u201cdespicable\u201d and a \u201cbetrayal\u201d.\n\n'Poisonous dagger from an Arab country'\n\nSecretary-General of the Palestine Liberation Organization Saeb Erekat said on Friday the agreement is a stab in the back of the Palestinian nation.\n\n\u201cI never expected this poisonous dagger to come from an Arab country,\u201d Erekat said as he addressed UAE rulers.\n\n\u201cYou are rewarding aggression \u2026 You have destroyed, with this move, any possibility of peace between Palestinians and Israelis,\u201d the senior Palestinian official and a veteran negotiator added.\n\nVarious Palestinian factions in the occupied West Bank and besieged Gaza Strip have roundly condemned the normalization announcement.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has voiced his \u201cstrong rejection and condemnation\u201d and called for an emergency meeting of the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).\n\nHamas denounced the pact as a \u201cstab in the back of the Palestinian people and a desperate attempt to undermine the resistance front, which aims to defeat the Israeli occupation and restore Palestinians\u2019 rights\u201d.\n\nThe movement said \"Emirati rulers will gain nothing but shame and loss, as they will sooner or later realize that the replacement of Arab allies with the Israeli occupation equals to political suicide\".\n\nThe Islamic Jihad movement also said normalization of ties between Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi marks a moral and strategic downfall in the UAE\u2019s policies.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "og": {"site_name": "PressTV", "title": "UAE rows back on claim after Israel rejects annexation cancelled", "type": "video", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The UAE has been forced to admit that its initial claim of having normalized ties with Israel in exchange for Tel Aviv", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.presstv.com/photo/20200815/4b60a546-7dac-46f6-9aee-07f0e5cd342a.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn.presstv.com/photo/20200815/4b60a546-7dac-46f6-9aee-07f0e5cd342a.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 360, "type": "image/jpg"}}, "title": "UAE rows back on claim after Israel rejects annexation cancelled", "description": "Press TV is an Iranian state-controlled news and documentary network that broadcasts in the English and French-language.
