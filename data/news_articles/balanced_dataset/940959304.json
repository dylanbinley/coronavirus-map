(Photo by Rich Fury/Getty Images)\n\nWu Tang really is for the children after all.\n\nThe RZA, music producer and co-founder of hip-hop group The Wu Tang Clan, has been commissioned by ice cream company Good Humor to craft a brand new ice cream truck jingle. The goal is to replace the original jingle which has \u201ca problematic history.\u201d\n\nRead More: Carole Baskin angered over cat imagery in \u2018WAP\u2019 music video\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK \u2013 SEPTEMBER 04: Oliver \u201cPower\u201d Grant (L), and RZA (C) attend Hulu\u2019s \u201cWu-Tang: An American Saga\u201d Premiere and Reception at Metrograph on September 04, 2019 in New York City. (Photo by Lars Niki/Getty Images for Hulu)\n\nIn the official promo video, \u201cThe Story Behind the New Ice Cream Truck Jingle from Good Humor x RZA,\u201d RZA, born Bobby Diggs, explained that the notorious ice cream jingle, \u201cTurkey in the Straw,\u201d has racist roots.\n\nThe video stated that the jingle\u2019s \u201cmelody was popularized in minstrel shows, and some adaptations paired it with hateful, racist lyrics.\u201d In a 2014 report by NPR, some of the offensive lyrics that have been paired with the song included multiple use of the N-word and references to watermelon.\n\n\u201cI remember the days when I would hear that iconic ice cream truck jingle outside, and I would drop what I was doing to chase it down for a treat,\u201d RZA said in a statement. \u201cWhen I learned about that song\u2019s problematic history this summer, I knew I had to get involved and do something about it.\u201d\n\nRead More: Jazz musician Chris \u2018Big Dog\u2019 Davis embraces life after cancer on debut album\n\nRZA said that Good Humor contacted him to create a new jingle.\n\n\u201cWe can change the dynamics,\u201d RZA said. \u201cWe can make a new ice cream jingle for a new era.\u201d\n\nThe ice cream company posted in the video that it was putting a call out to all truck drivers to stop using the \u201cTurkey in the Straw\u201d jingle and offered RZA\u2019s new jingle to play instead which they are releasing for free. Good Humor will also be using the new melody in all its forthcoming \u201cindustry standard ice cream truck boxes.\u201d\n\nGood Humor has not owned the ice cream trucks since 1976 but wanted to make a difference in changing the perception around it.\n\nRead More: Rihanna says new music coming \u2018sooner than you think\u2019\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be part of the solution and offer ice cream truck drivers a jingle that can bring joy to every community,\u201d Russel Lilly, a senior director at Unilever which is the parent company of Good Humor, said in a statement. \u201cSo, to create a new jingle, we knew we had to team up with the mastermind behind some of the most memorable melodies of our time.\u201d\n\nThe new jingle was played in the background as RZA explained the thought process behind composing it. \u201cWe wanted to make a melody that includes all communities, that\u2019s good for every driver, every kid.\u201d\n\nRZA is no stranger to making music attached to the cold, dessert treat. He produced Raekwon\u2019s popular 1995 single, \u201cIce Cream\u201c for his debut album, Only Built For Cuban Linx, which celebrated its 25th anniversary on August 1.\n\nHave you subscribed to theGrio\u2019s podcast \u201cDear Culture\u201d?
