It is childish; it is ridiculous and it shows that that movement as riddled that it is with dissent seeks only to dance to the tune of the United Workers Party,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe said the situation has been discussed at Parliament, the Prime Minister and Senior Minister Reginald Austrie have dealt with it.\n\n\u201cWe have dealt with it on the various radio programmes,\u201d Astaphan explained. \u201cWe have explained to the people that the $32,000 includes a fully furnished house, insurance and whatever have you and that the expenditure for the Prime Minister\u2019s residence may not be substantially used at all because of the new arrangements.\u201d\n\nMembers of the public are invited to join the gathering which is scheduled to be held from 2:30pm to 7:00pm.", "METADATA": {"robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Protest as Dominica PM moves into $32,000 per month mansion; Astaphan says it\u2019s opposition propaganda - Antigua Observer Newspaper", "description": "Spread the love(DNO) \u2013 Members of the Concerned Citizens Movement (CCM) are taking their gripe about the rental fee for the Prime Minister\u2019s residence at Morne Daniel to the entrance of that community today.
