The pair bears the burden of coronavirus (COVID-19) worries at home and the recent rise in the US Treasury yields to ignore the latest Business NZ PMI data for July.\n\nVirus wave 2.0 dims Kiwi\u2019s charm\u2026\n\nOn Thursday, The Guardian quoted New Zealand\u2019s (NZ) health chief, Dr. Bloomfield, to confirm that there 36 active cases in total. Following that NZ Prime Minister (PM) Jacinda Ardern noted that she expects the COVID-19 cluster to grow further before it slows. There is a cabinet meeting around 03:00 AM GMT which will release announcements on lockdown alert levels by 05:30 GMT, as per the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ).\n\nOther than the pandemic woes at home, RBNZ\u2019s dovish stand and recently upbeat statistics from the US also exert downside burden on the pair. Furthermore, the US-China jitters and uncertainty surrounding America\u2019s phase 4 stimulus additionally offer negative clues for the pair.\n\nMarket\u2019s sentiment stays sluggish with the US 10-year Treasury yields recently gaining traction against Wall Street\u2019s mildly negative performance. Even so, S&P 500 Futures rise 0.10% to 3,373 by the press time.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that New Zealand\u2019s Business NZ Manufacturing PMI data for July grew past-56.3 figures to 58.8 but failed to underpin the kiwi pair.\n\nMoving on, likely upbeat prints of China\u2019s Industrial Production and Retail Sales for July, expected to rise to 5.1% and 0.1% respectively versus 4.8% and -1.8%, are less likely to offer major upside to the pair unless being too optimistic. On the contrary, downbeat readings will exert additional pressure onto the pair. While noting this, ANZ said, \u201cRisks to our outlook are now skewed firmly to the downside, with the Q3 rebound in activity likely to be weaker for it. How much weaker, and for how long, will depend on what follows. But even if we get more clarity on alert levels today, uncertainty around the economic implications will be extreme.\u201d\n\nTechnical analysis\n\n50-day EMA near 0.6520 gains immediate attention of the NZD/USD pair sellers ahead of 0.6500 round-figures. On the contrary, 0.6595-0.6600 area comprising 21-day EMA becomes nearby resistance to watch during the pair\u2019s upside attempts.", "METADATA": {"google-site-verification": "xatunrX549RT_RGs4DQzzK3W7EYphAqTiZ-1akhRkEw", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 165130350199320}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://staticcontent.fxstreet.com/website/static-html/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "FXStreet", "application-name": "FXStreet", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "twitter": {"image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/NZDUSD/kiwi-dollar-62496010_Large.jpg", "card": "summary", "site": "@FXStreetUpdate", "title": "NZD/USD: Bears battle 0.6550 ahead of China data dump", "url": "https://www.fxstreet.com/news/nzd-usd-bears-battle-06550-ahead-of-china-data-dump-202008132254", "description": "NZD/USD stays depressed near 0.6545 during the initial Asian session on Friday.
