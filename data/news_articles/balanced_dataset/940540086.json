The latest issue of ISIS\u2019s Al-Naba\u2019 weekly included an article calling for the release of prisoners by force. In the ITIC\u2019s assessment, the article was published in light of the attack on the prison in Nangarhar (Afghanistan), which may have increased ISIS\u2019s motivation to carry out additional attacks to release the prisoners, especially in Syria and Iraq.

The largest number of casualties (122) was in the Khorasan Province (due to the attack on the prison). It was followed by the West Africa Province with 120 casualties; the Sinai Province with 117 casualties (due to the large-scale attack in northern Sinai); Iraq (86 casualties); and Syria (77 casualties). There were relatively few casualties in the other provinces (Al-Naba\u2019 weekly, as reported on Telegram on August 6, 2020).\n\nReturn to \u201croutine\u201d after the Raids of Attrition\n\nOn August 6, 2020, ISIS\u2019s Al-Naba\u2019 weekly released an infographic entitled \u201cThe Harvest of the Fighters,\u201d summing up its activity in the various provinces during the period of July 30 to August 5, 2020 (i.e., on the last two days of the Raids of Attrition, and the five subsequent days). During this period, ISIS operatives carried out a total of 65 attacks around the world, compared to 105 in the preceding week (meaning a decrease of about 40%). Twenty attacks were carried out in Iraq; 19 in Syria; 10 in West Africa (mostly in Nigeria); 5 in the Sinai Peninsula; 4 in Khorasan (i.e., Afghanistan); 3 in Bangladesh; 2 in Central Africa; 1 in Yemen and 1 in Somalia (Al-Naba\u2019 weekly, Telegram, August 6, 2020).\n\nThe Syrian arena\n\nThe Idlib region\n\nExchanges of artillery fire\n\nIn the Idlib region, artillery exchanges between the Syrian army and the rebels continued this week almost on a daily basis. This week as well, most of the incidents took place in Jabal al-Zawiya, south of Idlib. The Syrian army and militias supporting it against the Headquarters for the Liberation of Al-Sham took part in the exchange of fire.\n\nGround activity\n\nOn August 6, 2020, the rebel organizations halted an infiltration attempt by the militias supporting the Syrian army in the Kurd Mountains, about 45 km southwest of Idlib. The militias sustained casualties (Idlib Plus, August 6, 2020).\n\nThe relationship between the Headquarters for the Liberation of Al-Sham and other Salafist-jihadi organizations in the Idlib region\n\nOrwa Ajjoub, a researcher at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Lund University in Sweden, has written an article examining the relationship between the Headquarters for the Liberation of Al-Sham (HTS) and other Salafist-jihadi groups in the Idlib enclave, due to the possibility of imminent confrontation between the rival sides.[1]\n\nOverview\n\nHTS, the dominant jihadi rebel group in the Idlib region, is aggressively persecuting other armed groups in Syria. According to the author of the article, this is nothing new, since as early as January 2019, HTS launched multiple attacks against the Turkish-backed National Liberation Front, driving its forces out of western Aleppo and the Hama countryside. HTS set up its operations room and forced the armed groups to close their military bases, forbidding them to set up operations rooms of their own.\n\nAccording to the author of the article, this is nothing new, since as early as January 2019, HTS launched multiple attacks against the Turkish-backed National Liberation Front, driving its forces out of western Aleppo and the Hama countryside. HTS set up its operations room and forced the armed groups to close their military bases, forbidding them to set up operations rooms of their own. What has changed now is the character of the main rival of HTS. After the Islamic and jihadi armed groups disbanded, they joined the So Be Steadfast operations room[2], whose members had belonged to the Awaken the Believers operations room (headed by the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Guardians of the Religion Organization). The So Be Steadfast operations room comprises Salafist-jihadi groups such as Ansar al-Islam[3] and the Ansar al-Din Front[4].\n\nDetention of senior members of jihadist organizations by HTS\n\nHTS has launched numerous attacks against its main rival, the So Be Steadfast operations room. The groups belonging to this operations room oppose the realpolitik (considered by them as an opportunistic approach) of HTS leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani. In June 2020, HTS detained Abu Salah al-Uzbeki, a former senior commander who had defected from HTS and joined the Guardians of Religion Organization. It also detained other jihadi leaders: Abu Malik al-Tali, former member of the HTS advisory council (Shura) who had defected from its ranks; Abu al-Qassam al-Urdini, senior leader of the Guardians of Religion Organization; and a jihadi leader named Bilal al-San\u2019ani. The common denominator between these four commanders is their affiliation with the So Be Steadfast operations room.\n\nBasic gaps between the jihadi groups\n\nDue to fundamental disagreements which cannot be resolved through compromises between the rival sides, it is unlikely that the organizations belonging to the So Be Steadfast operations room will fight against the Syrian army under HTS even if they are pressured by to do so by HTS or Turkey. There are major ideological gaps between HTS and the organizations of the So Be Steadfast operations room. In addition, HTS has developed a relationship with Turkey, with both sides cooperating on various issues. The So Be Steadfast operations room objects to the agreements with Turkey regarding Idlib.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nA full-fledged confrontation between HTS and the So Be Steadfast operations room would be costly for both sides and would not serve the interests of either side. If such a confrontation occurs, the jihadi organizations that make up the So Be Steadfast operations room would have to fight for survival. Instead, what is likely to happen is an increase in economic pressure on the So Be Steadfast operations room, to stifle access to its already limited resources. HTS, its main rival, has actually started doing so in order to weaken and even disband it.\n\nISIS activity in the Syria Province (according to its claims of responsibility posted on Telegram)\n\nThe area of Deir ez-Zor, Al-Mayadeen, and Albukamal\n\nOn August 10, 2020 , ISIS activated an IED against an SDF vehicle about 10 km northeast of Albukamal.

Several soldiers were killed or wounded.\n\nThe roots of ISIS\u2019s West Africa Province\n\nA recent article by Jacob Zenn, a senior researcher of Islamic movements in Africa, sheds light on the roots and development of ISIS\u2019s West Africa Province.[6] According to the article, ISIS\u2019s West Africa Province began to take shape in Niger and Nigeria in the 1990s through Algerian envoys sent by Osama bin Laden. These envoys joined forces with local jihadist operatives and established the Boko Haram organization. Many Boko Haram operatives later pledged allegiance to ISIS and expanded their activity to other West African countries.\n\nThe Algerian roots of Boko Haram and of ISIS\u2019s West Africa Province\n\nThe jihadist group Boko Haram has long been described as a Nigerian local movement. Yet, today its main faction \u2013 Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) \u2013 operates in five countries outside Nigeria (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Mali).\n\nThe origins of jihad in Nigeria can be traced to the arrival of jihadists from Algeria in 1994. The background to this was the cancellation of the 1992 election in Algeria by the army, because an Islamist party was about to win the election. Algerian Islamists then joined Algerian veterans of the 1980s anti-Soviet Afghan jihad to wage jihad against Algeria\u2019s own rulers. Osama bin Laden, who moved to Sudan from Afghanistan after the war, sent two envoys to Niger, but both of them were arrested in 1994. Another Afghan jihad veteran, an Algerian referred to as Uncle Hassan, fled from Niger and became the first Algerian jihadist to arrive in Nigeria. In addition, in 1994, radical Islamic movements thrived in Nigeria and this led to the rise of Mohammed Yusuf, the future Boko Haram leader.\n\nDevelopment of jihadist groups in Nigeria: background of the establishment of Boko Haram\n\nUncle Hassan recruited youths in Nigeria to smuggle weapons and fight in the Sahel. He was joined by Muhammed Ali, a Nigerian student who had studied in Sudan and returned home after meeting with Bin Laden\u2019s envoys. By 9/11, Uncle Hassan\u2019s and Muhammed Ali\u2019s networks, including their university student recruits and Muhammed Yusuf\u2019s followers coalesced in the short-lived \u201cNigerian Taliban .\u201d This organization was liquidated in 2003 and its two leaders were killed by the Nigerian security forces.\n\nand returned home after meeting with Bin Laden\u2019s envoys. By 9/11, .\u201d This organization was liquidated in 2003 and its two leaders were killed by the Nigerian security forces. Muhammed Yusuf avoided death by fleeing to Saudi Arabia. On his return, he recruited Muslims who opposed the Nigerian rule and thus became a unique threat for the state authorities. He preached about jihad, the application of Sharia (Islamic law) and opposition to Nigeria\u2019s constitution and the Western education practiced there (Boko Haram means \u201cWestern education is sinful\u201d in the local Hausa language, and it has become the name of the group). Muhammed Yusuf was killed by the Nigerian security forces in 2009. His supporters received assistance, which enabled them to escape to the Sahel, where they trained with Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).\n\nEstablishment of ISIS\u2019s West Africa Province (ISWAP)\n\nMuhammed Yusuf\u2019s deputy, Abubakar Shekau, who became the new leader, finally named the group Jamaat Ahlussunnah lid-Dawa wal-Jihad (Sunni Muslim Group for Preaching and Jihad) in 2010. In 2015, he pledged allegiance to ISIS\u2019s leader, and renamed his group Islamic State in West Africa Province . He was deposed in 2016 by Muhammed Yusuf\u2019s son, Abu Musab al-Barnawi , who abhorred the harsh violence that Shekau had inflicted on Nigerian citizens.\n\n. , who abhorred the harsh violence that Shekau had inflicted on Nigerian citizens. ISIS fighters in West Africa led by Al-Barnawi, who are located in southeastern Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon and Chad, are in contact with jihadist groups in Burkina Faso, Mali and northwestern Niger. ISIS\u2019s West Africa Province is militarily and ideologically capable of threatening West African armies. What remains to be seen is whether the ISIS West Africa Province will manage to achieve its goal of creating a jihadist state in West Africa.\n\nChad\n\nOn August 3, 2020, an IED was activated against a Chadian army vehicle in the Lake Chad area in the southwest of the country (near the border with Nigeria). All the passengers were killed.\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\n\nOn August 4, 2020, ISIS operatives ambushed and exchanged fire with a Congolese army force in the area of Beni in the northeastern part of the country.

The two sides exchanged fire for several hours. About 50 soldiers were killed or wounded. In addition, weapons and ammunition were seized (Telegram, August 6, 2020). On August 11, 2020, ISIS\u2019s Central African Province released photos from the scene of the attack showing the bodies of at least 18 Mozambican soldiers as well as weapons, including dozens of assault rifles (Telegram, August 11, 2020).\n\n, ISIS operatives attacked two Mozambican army compounds in the area of Cabo Delgado in the northeastern part of the country.
