from Israeli 5G networks: US official", "TEXT": "The official told Reuters on Friday that a memorandum of understanding would likely be signed \u201cwithin weeks\u201d and confirmed quotes in an earlier Jerusalem Post report.\n\nIsrael and the United States are nearing a deal whereby Israel would commit not to use Chinese technology for its next generation 5G mobile telecoms networks, a U.S. official said.\n\nThe official told Reuters on Friday that a memorandum of understanding would likely be signed \u201cwithin weeks\u201d and confirmed quotes in an earlier Jerusalem Post report.\n\nThe newspaper quoted an unnamed U.S. official as saying that the United States was \u201coptimistic that Israel will \u2026 choose to only allow trusted vendors in its 5G networks\u201d.\n\nWashington has been alarmed by Beijing\u2019s dominance in the 5G infrastructure market and has pressed its allies to exclude kit made by Huawei Technologies from their networks.\n\nThis is partly being done through the U.S. State Department\u2019s Clean Network initiative, which says it seeks to eliminate the \u201clong-term threat to data privacy, security, and human rights posed to the free world from authoritarian malign actors, such as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\u201d.\n\nLast month, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered Huawei equipment to be purged completely from Britain\u2019s 5G network by the end of 2027, risking the ire of China by signalling that the world\u2019s biggest telecoms equipment maker is not welcome in the West.\n\nIsrael, Australia, Canada, Japan, Taiwan and European nations are among Washington\u2019s partners in The Clean Network initiative, according to the State Department\u2019s website.",
