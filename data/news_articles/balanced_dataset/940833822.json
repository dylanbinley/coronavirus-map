The police slaying has drawn a storm of criticism and a demand for improved relations between police and Indigenous people.\n\nBernard-Daisley, a band councillor with We\u2019koqma\u2019q First Nation and president of the Nova Scotia Native Women\u2019s Association, said the justice system has failed Moore\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s so apparent that she was murdered to everyone else other than the people that make the decision,\u201d she said, adding she would like to see the officer involved fired and charged with murder.\n\nBernard-Daisley also thinks the police shooting death of Rodney Levi and the acquittal of Maurice Johnson in the hit-and-run death of Brady Francis are other examples of how devalued Indigenous lives are in Canada. And until she sees the system change, she\u2019ll continue to fight.\n\n\u201cI will never stop until I leave this Earth,\u201d she said.\n\nShe encourages everyone to come on Sunday, bring hand drums, wear yellow to honour Moore and red to honour the MMIW, and bring photos of their own lost loved ones. She also wants to remind people the march will be peaceful and to ignore the detractors because it's all about honouring lost family members.\n\n\u201cCome and join us, and come and support us,\u201d Bernard-Daisley said.\n\nRELATED:", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "WE\u2019KOQMA\u2019Q \u2014 Annie Bernard-Daisley is planning a march at the Canso Causeway this weekend as a continued call for justice for Chantel Moore and other murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls, 2SLGTBQ, and men and boys.\r\n\r\nThe", "author": "Oscar Baker III", "al": {"ios": {"url": "saltwirenewsmobile://content?url=http%3A//www.saltwire.com/news/canada/canso-causeway-shutdown-planned-to-honour-mmiw-485400/&sectionName=All%20News&fallback=1", "app_store_id": 1501537135, "app_name": "SaltWire News"}}, "og": {"title": "Canso Causeway shutdown planned for Sunday to honour MMIW | SaltWire", "description": "WE\u2019KOQMA\u2019Q \u2014 Annie Bernard-Daisley is planning a march at the Canso Causeway this weekend as a continued call for justice for Chantel Moore and other murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls, 2SLGTBQ, and men and boys.\r\n\r\nThe", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.saltwire.com/media/photologue/photos/cache/canso-causeway-shutdown-planned-to-honour-mmiw-1_medium.jpg", "width": 458, "height": 305}, "url": "http://www.saltwire.com/news/canada/canso-causeway-shutdown-planned-to-honour-mmiw-485400/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Canso Causeway shutdown planned for Sunday to honour MMIW | SaltWire", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.saltwire.com/media/photologue/photos/cache/canso-causeway-shutdown-planned-to-honour-mmiw-1_medium.jpg", "alt": "Annie Bernard Daisley"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1501537135", "msapplication-config": "/static/overrides/saltwire/dist/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
