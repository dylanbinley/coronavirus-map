This put them in the situation of using their nuclear weapons\u2014the ultimate guarantor of their security\u2014or losing them.\u201d\n\nIf war erupts with North Korea, then the U.S. military will have problems, according to a series of wargames conducted by the RAND Corporation.\n\nInvading North Korea to capture or destroy Kim Jong-un\u2019s nuclear arsenal, or to knock out artillery batteries threatening Seoul, would overstretch and deplete American and South Korean forces. More ominously, this could also trigger Chinese military intervention.\n\nRAND focused on the ability of the U.S. military\u2014and especially the U.S. Army, which sponsored the research\u2014to respond to three potential issues: the threat of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons, the ability of North Korean conventional artillery to devastate Seoul, and the military and diplomatic challenges of securing Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear arsenal should the Communist regime collapse and North Korea degenerate into civil war.\n\n\u201cWe simply don\u2019t have enough troops to search North Korea for loose nukes and perform all the other missions of a post-conflict or collapse scenario, and we can\u2019t get them into North Korea nearly quickly enough to avoid leakage,\u201d RAND researcher Michael Mazarr told the National Interest.\n\nRegarding nuclear weapons, the report pointed out an obvious but uncomfortable fact: a sufficiently large North Korea atomic arsenal will render an invasion and conquest of North Korea impossible. \u201cWithin five to eight years, North Korea is likely to have enough survivable nuclear capability to make any move into North Korea prohibitively costly in the absence of transformative new capabilities to neutralize the North Korean nuclear force.\u201d And regardless of U.S. policy, South Korea and Japan may be constrained by the prospect of North Korean nuclear retaliation.\n\nAs for threat of North Korea\u2019s formidable artillery arsenal (reportedly more than ten thousand artillery pieces) turning Seoul into a sea of fire, RAND examined either knocking out the guns with air and artillery strikes, or a limited cross-border invasion to seize the Kaesong Heights where the weapons are emplaced. But air and artillery fire could take weeks to knock out the heavily fortified guns, while a ground invasion runs the risk of triggering use of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons.\n\nA major problem is that even a limited invasion would require massive forces, including two full South Korean corps. And there is reason to question whether South Korea could sustain the effort. \u201cIn our wargames, it was not unusual for the equivalent of a corps to be destroyed in one week\u2019s fighting to achieve a single penetration, translating to tens of thousands of casualties,\u201d RAND noted. \u201cCasualties at this scale would likely exhaust the South Korean military\u2019s capacity for follow-on missions, such as unifying the peninsula or securing WMD sites.\u201d\n\nWhile that conclusion is based on a specific scenario\u2014attacking a narrow, heavily defended corridor and with North Korea using chemical weapons\u2014the wargames indicated that \u201cSouth Korea grinds up much of its offensive striking power just to get through or clear out the Kaesong vicinity,\u201d Mazarr said. \u201cThat leaves a lot of ROK [Republic of Korea] capacity but not necessarily the sort that can punch through defenses. What that means in terms of a larger campaign we don\u2019t evaluate. My personal view is that indeed, the ROK alone would stall out long before getting to Pyongyang.\u201d\n\nAs for securing North Korean nuclear weapons, RAND conducted several wargames based on the premise that U.S. troops moved in to capture the nukes after Kim Jong-un died and his nation degenerated into civil war. But the wargames suggested any successors to the North Korean leader would have an incentive to keep control of the nukes as a matter of political power (and hiding them would be easy). Nor could airpower alone destroy them, just as aerial Scud-busting failed in Iraq.\n\n\u201cIt surprised me at how easy it was for the North Koreans to hide, or make it difficult, for the United States and the ROK [South Korea] to find nuclear weapons or nuclear materials,\u201d Stacie Pettyjohn, co-director of RAND\u2019s Center for Gaming, told The National Interest.\n\nThose who believe that toppling Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime would solve the problem should pay attention to this finding in the RAND report: \u201cIn all the wargames, at least one of the North Korean factions employed a nuclear weapon during the conflict. While the United States may believe that securing North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal is a limited mission, some North Korean factions in the wargames tended to view U.S. intervention as the prelude to unification and thus an existential threat to North Korea as an independent entity. This put them in the situation of using their nuclear weapons\u2014the ultimate guarantor of their security\u2014or losing them.\u201d\n\nThen there is the China question. During the RAND wargames, Chinese forces entered North Korea to secure the Sino-North Korean border as well as nuclear weapons facilities in the northern part of the country. In addition, a ground operation to destroy artillery batteries on the Kaesong Heights would also place U.S. and South Korean troops on the Kaesong corridor, one of the few invasion routes toward the Chinese border. In 1950, this provoked a massive Chinese response, and the same could happen again.\n\nHowever, Mazarr cautions that a lot depends on the situation. \u201cThe behavior of China in our games both suggests and assumes that Beijing would want to stay out of a U.S.-North Korea clash as much as it could. The question becomes the origins of the clash and whether it feels its credibility is on the line at a critical moment as it seeks greater influence and status. So if North Korea begins an unprovoked artillery barrage on Seoul, clearance ops in Kaesong might not cause China to flinch. But what if we hit first and the North Korean shots are a response?\u201d\n\nMichael Peck is a contributing writer for the National Interest. He can be found on Twitter and Facebook.
