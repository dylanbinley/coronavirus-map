REUTERS/Lisi Niesner/Pool\n\nThe U.N. Security Council has started voting on a U.S. bid to renew the embargo, expiring in mid-October. Veto-powers Russia and China are opposed, and results are due within hours.\n\nVisiting Austria as part of a tour of central Europe, Pompeo said Iran must also provide full and immediate cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog, whose head he met in Vienna.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense to permit the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism to purchase and sell weapons systems,\u201d Pompeo told a news conference. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s just nuts.\u201d\n\nIran denies promoting terrorism.\n\nPompeo said Washington would \u201cdo everything that we can within our diplomatic toolset to ensure that arms embargo doesn\u2019t expire\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe voting will be in the next handful of hours and we are hoping that we will be successful. When we see the results, we will make the decision about how to move forward.\n\n\u201cWe have been unambiguous about the fact we have no intention of allowing this arms embargo to expire. None whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe embargo is set to end mid-October under Tehran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration quit in 2018.\n\nIAEA head Rafael Grossi, whose agency is policing Iran\u2019s nuclear deal with major powers, told reporters after meeting Pompeo that talks with Tehran on full access to all sites continued.\n\n\u201cWe have requested Iran to grant access. That hasn\u2019t happened yet. We are working on that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur objective is to get access to continue the verification work which is essential for the international community.\u201d", "METADATA": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "worldNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "worldNews;everythingNews;middle-east-news;middle-east;middle-east-full-coverage;US-The-Wire;USWire_EL", "description": "The United States will do everything in its power to renew the international arms embargo on Iran under review at the United Nations, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday.", "Author": "Kirsti Knolle", "keywords": "US,AUSTRIA,USA,POMPEO,Defense,Western Europe,International Trade,Iran,Military Conflicts,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Government / Politics,Austria,International Atomic Energy Agency,Europe,Middle East,US Government News,United Nations,International / National Security,United States", "news_keywords": "US;AUSTRIA;USA;POMPEO;Defense;Western Europe;International Trade;Iran;Military Conflicts;Diplomacy / Foreign Policy;Government / Politics;Austria;International Atomic Energy Agency;Europe;Middle East;US Government News;United Nations;International / National Security;United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Fri Aug 14 15:57:30 UTC 2020", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2020-08-14T15:57:30+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Kirsti Knolle", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-austria-usa-pompeo-idUSKCN25A1LQ", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "U.S. will do utmost to renew Iran arms embargo: Pompeo", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,AUSTRIA,USA,POMPEO,Defense,Western Europe,International Trade,Iran,Military Conflicts,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Government / Politics,Austria,International Atomic Energy Agency,Europe,Middle East,US Government News,United Nations,International / National Security,United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-AUSTRIA-USA-POMPEO", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "Slideshow", "analyticsAttributes.title": "U.S. will do utmost to renew Iran arms embargo: Pompeo", "sailthru.author": "Kirsti Knolle", "sailthru.date": "2020-08-14T15:57:30+0000", "sailthru.title": "U.S. will do utmost to renew Iran arms embargo: Pompeo", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "U.S. will do utmost to renew Iran arms embargo: Pompeo", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-austria-usa-pompeo-idUSKCN25A1LQ", "type": "article", "description": "The United States will do everything in its power to renew the international arms embargo on Iran under review at the United Nations, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday.", "image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200814&t=2&i=1529654138&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7D1BF", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T15:57:30+0000", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T15:57:30+0000", "section": "World", "author": "Kirsti Knolle", "tag": "US,AUSTRIA,USA,POMPEO,Defense,Western Europe,International Trade,Iran,Military Conflicts,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Government / Politics,Austria,International Atomic Energy Agency,Europe,Middle East,US Government News,United Nations,International / National Security,United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "U.S. will do utmost to renew Iran arms embargo: Pompeo", "description": "The United States will do everything in its power to renew the international arms embargo on Iran under review at the United Nations, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200814&t=2&i=1529654138&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7D1BF", "src": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200814&t=2&i=1529654138&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7D1BF"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Article - News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "World - World", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "World", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "World", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}}}
