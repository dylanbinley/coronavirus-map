And the United States and any entity which may assist it or acquiesce in its illegal behavior, will bear the full responsibility,\u201d Ravanchi said on Friday.\n\nIran has faced a US-led arms embargo for 13 years. The embargo is set to expire in October, under the terms of the JCPOA, which would have seen Tehran scale back its nuclear program in exchange for sanction relief. The deal was signed in 2015 between Iran, the United States, China, France, Russia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the European Union.\n\nIn May 2018, US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the JCPOA. Beginning in 2019, Tehran began to step away from its commitments under the deal, reiterating that its nuclear program remains exclusively peaceful.", "METADATA": {"description": "Earlier in the day, the UN Security Council rejected a resolution aimed at extending the arms embargo against Iran, ahead of its expiration in October.", "keywords": "Iran's arms embargo, US on arms embargo extension, UNSC rejected extension", "news_keywords": "Iran's arms embargo, US on arms embargo extension, UNSC rejected extension", "robots": "all", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "ahrefs-site-verification": "ahrefs-site-verification_899ad24abeb428773ae480d902877f72151b81b12d4b7293cbfa1c452c76adcd", "analytics": {"site_domain": "sputniknews.com", "article_id": 1080174831, "p_ts": 1597446616, "author": "Daria Bedenko.
