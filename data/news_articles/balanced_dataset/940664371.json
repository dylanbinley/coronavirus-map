With that strategic mistake, the UAE will be engulfed in Zionist fire,\u201d he added.\n\nIsrael and the UAE reached a historic deal Thursday that will restore diplomatic ties between them. The Emirates became the third Arab country to recognize Israel after Jordan and Egypt.\n\nThe deal was brokered by US President Donald Trump in a phone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\n\nWhile the deal has been welcomed by some countries, it has triggered tremendous anger and outrage in most Muslim countries.\n\nAlthough Iran does not recognize the state of Israel, calling it \u201can illegitimate regime,\u201d it has recently warmed up to the UAE following the Emirates\u2019 political fallout with Riyadh.\n\nLast week, Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif held a video conference with his Emirati counterpart Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan to discuss issues of mutual interest.\n\nFollowing this, Zarif tweeted that they had \u201cagreed to continue dialogue on the theme of hope \u2014 especially as the region faces tough challenges and tougher choices ahead.\u201d\n\nZarif, who arrived in Beirut late Thursday on his first visit to Lebanon following last week\u2019s devastating explosion, has not yet commented on the UAE-Israeli deal.\n\nThe government of Hassan Rouhani, which is already facing a hostile parliament dominated by conservatives, is likely to face more questions over the recent bonhomie with Israel\u2019s new ally in the region, say observers.\n\nMeanwhile, in another reaction, former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s close aide Abdol Reza Soltani warned that Israel is now \u201cclose to the strategic Strait of Hormuz.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to change the equations to free all holy places,\u201d he said, apparently referring to Jerusalem.\n\nSenior political commentator Foad Izadi, expressing anguish over the accord, said the house of a Palestinian family was demolished in Jerusalem yesterday, and today, the Israeli regime was \u201crecognized by the UAE.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2020 Anadolu Agency.
