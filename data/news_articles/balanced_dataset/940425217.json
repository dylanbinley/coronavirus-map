Creature Comforts Brewing, based out of Athens, Georgia, will open in the summer of 2021 as part of the slow expansion of City Market South, which is already home to Rossoblu, Superfine, Dama, Cognoscenti Coffee, and a slew of offices and event spaces.\n\nForbes and others first picked up the news yesterday, saying that plans are in place to partner with well-known Hollywood writer Marvel director Joe Russo on the project. Russo\u2019s return to the restaurant scene in Downtown LA comes a year after the surprising closure of Simone in the Arts District and the loss of acclaimed chef Jessica Largey in what was one of the wilder restaurant news rides of 2019.\n\n\u201cLos Angeles stood out because of its large craft beer community, the success of numerous independent, small craft breweries and California\u2019s brewery-friendly state laws,\u201d Creature Comforts owners said in a statement. Indeed the entire Southern California craft beer scene has been white-hot for years now, at least before the coronavirus pandemic and slowing economy began seriously eroding industry gains. Downtown, meanwhile, has also seen large losses in the restaurant industry, with prominent projects like Broken Spanish closing in recent weeks.\n\nThere is no definitive timetable for the Georgia-based brewery\u2019s arrival, though at least one partner is relocating to Los Angeles to help facilitate the launch. Expect more details on the size and scope of the facility as time goes on.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Eater LA", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/eaterla", "published_time": "2020-08-12T11:58:00-07:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-12T11:58:00-07:00"}, "author": "Farley Elliott", "fb": {"pages": "6029273333,242726355745404,115169205199800,139755792796580,131547960225574,213601342019363,301223156562915,309491225851948,243335249017579,348494641841991,109814609047278,442143005803582,110073695686645,385346484849141,451388614896528,240433149442075,670887879603309,150611155024023,176453365796072,110358775652218,465169560201718,105842919452319,213198508690703,192135047484517,243781239374345,111376838888644", "app_id": 549923288395304}, "style-tools": "https://www.eater.com/style/community/500/63193d75042f1d6e8f03c71de2137c9c/tools.css", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "description": "The Georgia-based Creature Comforts crew is coming next summer, with the help of Joe Russo of Avengers fame", "og": {"description": "The Georgia-based Creature Comforts crew is coming next summer, with the help of Joe Russo of Avengers fame", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16Eb_av2Oes9AbnR1ng0ZvvhMUs=/0x98:1365x813/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21730262/creature_comforts_beer_facebook.jpg", "alt": "An orange backround highlights a black can of tall beer with a swirly label.", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "Eater LA", "title": "Big New Brewery Planned For Downtown LA\u2019s City Market South Development", "type": "article", "url": "https://la.eater.com/2020/8/12/21364479/creature-comforts-brewery-craft-beer-downtown-la-city-market-south-opening-summer"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://la.eater.com/2020/8/12/21364479/creature-comforts-brewery-craft-beer-downtown-la-city-market-south-opening-summer", "title": "Big New Brewery Planned For Downtown LA\u2019s City Market South Development", "description": "The Georgia-based Creature Comforts crew is coming next summer, with the help of Joe Russo of Avengers fame", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ouskTaPUfsad_ulvnzfo6m1Xvn4=/0x114:1365x797/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21730262/creature_comforts_beer_facebook.jpg", "alt": "An orange backround highlights a black can of tall beer with a swirly label."}, "site": "eaterla"}, "sailthru.title": "Big New Brewery Planned For Downtown LA\u2019s City Market South Development", "sailthru.tags": "general,eater-la,front-page,coming-attractions", "sailthru.description": "The Georgia-based Creature Comforts crew is coming next summer, with the help of Joe Russo of Avengers fame", "sailthru.date": "2020-08-12T11:58:00-07:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WJoeQqnEqSMWCcVJWViJyqullSU=/0x71:1365x839/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67194143/creature_comforts_beer_facebook.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-7dY0ADxZIXCEw9D-hRfn-YF1tE=/228x0:1138x910/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67194143/creature_comforts_beer_facebook.0.jpg", "parsely-title": "Big New Brewery Planned For Downtown LA\u2019s City Market South Development", "parsely-link": "https://la.eater.com/2020/8/12/21364479/creature-comforts-brewery-craft-beer-downtown-la-city-market-south-opening-summer", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WJoeQqnEqSMWCcVJWViJyqullSU=/0x71:1365x839/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67194143/creature_comforts_beer_facebook.0.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-08-12T11:58:00-07:00", "parsely-section": "coming-attractions", "parsely-author": "Farley Elliott", "parsely-tags": "la-eater,front-page,feed-filter-390,coming-attractions,feed-filter-472,feed-filter-508,feed-filter-518,feed-filter-1321,feed-filter-1419,feed-filter-2019,feed-filter-2107,feed-filter-2203,feed-filter-2349", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6253179/apple-touch-icon-144x144.0.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#e20000", "outbrainsection": "coming-attractions"}}}
