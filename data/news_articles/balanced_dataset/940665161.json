It doesn't just tell us what they believed and how they worshiped: the stories also tell what they frowned upon, what they aspired to, and what they believed a person should never, ever do. Here, we're mostly talking about that last part.\n\nWhen we learn about Greek mythology in a formal setting \u2014 like school \u2014 we hear a lot about the heroes. We hear about Herakles and his labors, the warriors of Troy, of Odysseus's journey, and Theseus's battle with the Minotaur. But you know what? You've only heard part of the story, because Theseus wasn't exactly a hero \u2014 he was a total jerk who abandoned Ariadne after she helped him escape the Labyrinth. There are two different versions of that story: in one, he leaves and she hangs herself. In another, he ditches her on Naxos and she's only saved from certain death by Dionysus (via Britannica). But you're never taught that, are you?\n\nIt turns out that there's a lot of little details \u2014 and entire stories \u2014 that are super dark, and just sort of slip through the cracks of higher learning. Let's get dark.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://img1.grunge.com/img/gallery/stories-from-greek-mythology-they-couldnt-teach-you-in-school/intro-1597365416.jpg", "title": "Stories from Greek mythology they couldn't teach you in school", "description": "When we learn about Greek mythology in school, we hear a lot about the heroes.
