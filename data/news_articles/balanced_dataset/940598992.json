The province continues to be the fourth highest in terms of deaths.\n\n\n\nLast week, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize visited the Clairwood, Northdale and Richmond hospitals as part of his preparation for a peak on the east coast.\n\nMkhize said while numbers were dropping slightly, KZN was expected to peak in the coming weeks.\n\nDid you know you can comment on this article?
