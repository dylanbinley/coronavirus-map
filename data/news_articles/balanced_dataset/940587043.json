And we have given the first response today,\u201d Erdogan said in the address, according to state media.\n\nA build-up of Greek Navy ships and Turkish warships - the latter escorting the Oru\u00e7 Reis - has already been confirmed after official Turkish government sources released earlier photos showing a military escort while the seismic research vessel probes near Greece's easternmost islands.\n\nIf there was an actual exchange of fire, or perhaps a ramming incident, it likely would not have involved the Oru\u00e7 Reis directly, but instead one among the multiple Turkish military escort vessels.\n\nThe Oru\u00e7 Reis does not sail alone, it has a navy escort.
