Can it use this momentum and its tieup with Marks & Spencer to crack mainstream grocery in the UK?\n\nOcado is a \u201ctiny, tiny retailer\u201d. That\u2019s according to Ocado Retail CEO Mel Smith. She knows the names of every one of its 377 head office staff, she says \u2013 less a \u201cmanagement trick\u201d then a reflection of her roots in New Zealand, where such things are \u201cjust good manners\u201d.\n\nIn terms of UK sales (as opposed to the eye-watering share price of its parent group), Ocado Retail is indeed small. Despite soaring demand due to the pandemic, its share of the UK grocery market, according to Kantar figures, is just 1.7%. But Ocado has less-than-tiny ambitions in the UK, boosted by the exclusive deal to sell Marks & Spencer products on its website. So how big can it get? Can it be a mainstream operator to rival the major mults? And if so, how?\n\nOcado Group CEO Tim Steiner believes that, thanks to Covid-19, grocery shopping has changed forever. Now accounting for 13% of the market [Nielsen], online grocery will double and become \u201cthe mainstream method for grocery distribution\u201d, he predicts.\n\nSmith is even more ambitious. \u201cI thought he was soft \u2013 I thought he should have been bolder,\u201d she tells The Grocer, in a call from Ocado\u2019s Hatfield headquarters. \u201cHalf the market should be shopping online, it\u2019s just a question of when. I don\u2019t think this is bullish, I think this is realistic.\u201d\n\nOcado\u2019s long-awaited venture with M&S, which kicks off on 1 September, will put it in the best position to capitalise on this mass adoption of online, she adds. Rather than a high-end, niche offering, she sees this as a mainstream proposition.\n\nTrouble is, it\u2019s full. While rivals have been able to leverage their store-picking model to increase output significantly, Ocado\u2019s highly automated CFC model \u2013 and that devastating fire at Andover last year \u2013 means it can\u2019t turn on capacity like a tap. That\u2019s left Ocado with a waiting list of 1.1 million customers \u2013 but it puts an automatic brake on immediate expectations for growth.\n\nAs M&S chairman Archie Norman told investors at the AGM last month: \u201cWe can\u2019t say how much scope there will be for new M&S customers after switchover, [but] it\u2019s likely to be very limited.\u201d\n\nSmith admits that, \u201cmathematically yes\u201d, Ocado\u2019s inability to ramp up capacity as quickly as supermarkets has eroded its share of the online UK grocery market.\n\nBut it\u2019s hardly a negative picture. Its share of the total market has grown faster than anyone\u2019s. Ocado\u2019s overall sales grew 27.2% in the first half, and they are tracking at 40% up in the latest quarter. Smith says the likes of Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s bringing millions of people onto the channel for the first time works in Ocado\u2019s favour, even if it can\u2019t serve them all just yet. Trying online grocery is a bigger hurdle for consumers than switching providers. \u201cThey\u2019ve helped us enormously,\u201d Smith says.\n\nCapacity\n\nCrucially, Ocado is also planning to add 50% more capacity across its network of CFCs and spokes over the next year. The first of the new sites \u2013 a \u2018mini\u2019 CFC \u2013 will open in Bristol early next year, with the reopening of Andover slated for the back end of the year. The joint venture agreement with M&S commits a further eight CFCs over the next decade, but conceivably the figure could now be higher (see box, below).\n\nSmith is playing a long-term game, arguing that unlike store-picking rivals, for whom online delivery is dilutive, with Ocado\u2019s highly automated CFC model, \u201cthe economics work\u201d. As supermarkets try to steer people away from online, Ocado will be there to pick them up.\n\nThere have been some capacity wins, too. The most significant is what the company calls the \u2018shape of the week\u2019. While strain on capacity used to fluctuate across different days, now, with most people still at home, CFCs run at peak every day.\n\n\u201cOur ability to get the maximum capacity out of every day is unprecedented. We\u2019ve never been able to do that before,\u201d Smith says. It\u2019s a \u201cfair assumption\u201d the trend will last.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ocado has also been able to drip feed slots to some of the 1.1 million customers on the waiting list \u2013 a \u201cstrategic\u201d selection made possible due to the fact \u201ca lot of our core customer base is now going on holidays\u201d, Smith says.\n\nThe recent outreach is a delicately balanced and potentially risky move. While it would have been \u201cchurlish\u201d not to let more customers access the service as demand has eased, there \u201cis a risk, yes\u201d that they will be bumped off the site again. And the threat of a second wave means \u201cthere is a chance we may have to be more restrictive about who we can serve\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a gamble with Ocado\u2019s reputation, already damaged by its inability to meet demand. The problem will only be exacerbated by the likely rush on the website post-switchover.\n\n\u201cAs things settle, Ocado will be faced with proving their reliability, and potentially winning back disappointed customers,\u201d says Caroline Lucas-Garner, strategy director at We Are Social. But the challenge, if Ocado is to go mainstream, isn\u2019t just about capacity constraints or business models. It will also take a new approach to marketing. Until now Ocado had a customer acquisition model that relied on leaflets through letterboxes.\n\n\u201cThat was exactly the right strategy when you\u2019re trying to get from zero customers to a million. It\u2019s not the right strategy when you\u2019re trying to get from a million to 10 million,\u201d says Smith.\n\nHearts and minds challenge\n\nSmith is coy on how the next 10 million can be convinced to sign-up, but vacancies posted in the past few weeks reveal the company\u2019s intentions. One marketing role calls for experience in TV and radio advertising.\n\nM&S\u2019s own massive marketing division will likely leap into action too, especially since, as analyst Andy Halliwell at Publicis Sapient says: \u201cIt\u2019s not overstating it to say that M&S will be betting the whole business on this being a success\u201d.\n\nThat \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to signal huge marketing budgets\u201d says Lucas-Garner. Word of mouth and M&S\u2019s celebrity advocacy approach could do the trick.\n\nThe influence of M&S is already showing in Ocado\u2019s celebrity chef blog tie-ups. Social media efforts are already ramping up and \u201cuser generated content\u201d will also play its part.\n\nIt\u2019s understood Ocado\u2019s highly recognisable vans will also be leveraged. \u201cTheir vehicles are a massive advertising resource that should be fully utilised,\u201d says Robin Duxbury, director of branding agency Clements Create.\n\nAcquisition efforts won\u2019t be immediate \u2013 capacity needs to increase first \u2013 but \u201cyou will see a fundamental shift in how we talk to customers\u201d Smith says. \u201cWe\u2019re building an entirely new way of marketing and engaging.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who don\u2019t know who we are. Or they think we\u2019re not for them. And that\u2019s the hearts and minds challenge we\u2019re trying to win right now,\u201d she adds.\n\nThose that think they know Ocado, know it as a premium brand. This barrier to take-up is unlikely to be cracked by switching from Waitrose to M&S, but must be to achieve mainstream status.\n\nGranted, M&S has already completed a massive product matching exercise for all 4,000 Waitrose SKUs on Ocado.com. Most are cheaper, it has claimed. But being cheaper than Waitrose doesn\u2019t make it mainstream.\n\nMiya Knights, head of industry insight at Eagle Eye, says Ocado can address this problem by clearly differentiating between M&S and Ocado\u2019s own-label range. On the one hand, M&S products will ensure it \u201cdoesn\u2019t lose those less price-sensitive customers who are looking for quality\u201d, she says.\n\n\u201cOn the other, the currently comparatively limited food choice from M&S does present an opportunity to diversify by adding more value lines to attract more value-conscious shoppers.\u201d\n\nOcado\u2019s own-label range was launched in 2010 and has grown to about 600 SKUs over the past decade \u2013 about 10% of sales. Ocado plans to expand the range further, says Smith, who adds \u201cwe\u2019re good value for money\u201d and Ocado and M&S\u2019 \u201cprice perception is not entirely aligned to what the actual prices are.\u201d\n\nOne possible marketing opportunity is to raise awareness of its Low Price Promise \u2013 the only remaining price-matching scheme, which gifts customers a voucher for \u201cmore than the difference\u201d if items are cheaper at Tesco.com \u2013 though it doesn\u2019t match promotions or Tesco own-label.\n\nSomewhat coyly, Ocado tweeted recently in reference to the Tesco price war that \u201cif Tesco match Aldi and we match Tesco\u2026\u201d. Smith is optimistic on this point. Better value will come with growth, and bring improved \u201cbuying economics\u201d, she says.\n\nOn the other hand, Ocado\u2019s annual anytime delivery pass \u2013 held by 70% of customers \u2013 is the most expensive on the market at \u00a3109.99.\n\nWhile it may not be able to win on value, it can best the competition on range, however, which Smith says is \u201ctwice as big\u201d as rivals. Winning the nation could come not from mass appeal, but appealing to millions of picky individuals.\n\n\u201cFor most customers there\u2019s three or four things in their basket they can\u2019t get anywhere else,\u201d Smith says. The needs of shoppers seeking organic and vegan products are particularly well met. \u201cOur range is better, so we naturally win in all of those categories. And there\u2019s a lot of them in the UK,\u201d Smith says.\n\nService level is also an advantage over the supermarkets. Currently substitutions are less than 4%, and 97% of orders are delivered on time.\n\n\u201cThose customers who shop with us love us. They really love us. They are massively sticky. All of the stats would say we are much better than everybody else from a range and service perspective. As and when we add capacity I\u2019m confident people will come,\u201d Smith says.\n\nAnd for Smith, she will only consider it job done when the ultimate goal is reached: \u201cWhen we\u2019re as big as Tesco.\u201d In market cap, that\u2019s not so fanciful. In terms of UK share, there\u2019s a fair few hurdles to go.\n\nCapacity growth: maxi, mini or micro?\n\nAcross all Ocado\u2019s sites, pick efficiency continues to improve, boosting throughput, with further gains promised by recent robotic picking wins. But with all of its mature facilities running at peak volumes, Ocado will need to build more CFCs, to grow share.\n\nWork at three facilities is already underway. The Andover CFC, which was devastated by a fire early last year, will reopen in autumn 2021, and handle 70,000 orders per week. Also in 2021, a CFC will open in Purfleet, which will serve areas north of the Thames at a rate of 85,000 orders per week.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing launch is the first \u2018mini\u2019 CFC in Bristol, which will open early next year and handle 30,000 orders per week. The mid-size format stands to massively increase Ocado\u2019s reach. The fact that online grocery shopping has risen to its current rate means that more cities like Bristol that were previously unrealistic targets could open up, and The Grocer understands that several new mini CFCs are now under consideration.\n\nOcado is also bullish on establishing more micro CFCs for its rapid delivery Zoom business. Last month, Tim Steiner said Ocado was on an \u201caccelerated search\u201d for additional sites, given \u201cthere\u2019s clearly demand for a dozen or two dozen Zooms just in London alone\u201d.", "METADATA": {"description": "Ocado\u2019s sales have soared in lockdown.
