Costa Rica has 17,445 known active cases and 8,412 recoveries.\n\nThe data indicate Costa Rica has 5.32 COVID-19-related deaths per 100,000 people.\n\nMost hospitalized patients have at least one risk factor \u2014 hypertension, diabetes, obesity and smoking are the most common \u2014 and elderly adults are at significantly higher risk of COVID-19 complications.\n\nHealth Ministry emphasizes risk to elderly\n\nWith Mother\u2019s Day approaching, the Health Ministry has emphasized the higher risk of coronavirus complications among elderly adults.\n\nAccording to the Health Ministry, 12.1% of elderly adults who tested positive for COVID-19 died due to causes related to the disease.\n\nThe risk of death is significantly lower among younger adults (0.4%), while no minors have died of COVID-19 in Costa Rica.\n\n\u201cWe must implement the necessary measures to take care of our elderly people,\u201d said Health Minister Daniel Salas. \u201cWithin the framework of Mother\u2019s Day this call becomes even more urgent. Let\u2019s find ways to express our love by protecting our loved ones.\u201d\n\nActive coronavirus cases in Costa Rica\n\nStarting July 25, Costa Rica considers some patients as confirmed cases without requiring a positive test. This only applies if a person living with someone who has tested positive begins exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nThe Health Ministry\u2019s definitions also qualify certain patients as recovered based on time rather than a negative test.\n\nDeaths comprise people who tested positive for the coronavirus and died, when health authorities believe COVID-19 either caused or contributed to the death.\n\nThe below graph shows Costa Rica\u2019s test-positivity rate. (Cases confirmed without a test are excluded from the graph.)\n\nThe Greater Metropolitan Area is the country\u2019s current epicenter. Costa Rica is in a \u201cClosed Phase\u201d through August 21; click here to understand the latest restrictions.\n\nThe below graphic will update automatically when the Health Ministry releases detailed information on the number of tests processed and the location of new cases later this afternoon.\n\nIf you believe you have COVID-19, contact Costa Rica\u2019s hotline at 1322.
