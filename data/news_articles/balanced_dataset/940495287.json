New Zealand\u2019s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern delayed the dissolution of parliament, and imposed a three day lockdown in Auckland in order to swiftly deal with the situation.\n\nNew Zealand has been applauded for its handling of the pandemic, but the country received some bad news earlier this week forcing Auckland to back into lockdown.\n\nEarlier this week four new infected family members took the country by surprise, ending more than three COVID-19 free months.\n\nSince then, New Zealand has reported 14 new cases of coronavirus, just one day after Auckland went back into lockdown.\n\nOut of the 14 new cases, 13 of them have been traced back to the family.\n\nThe other new case is an overseas arrival who was in quarantine.\n\nREAD MORE- New Zealand lockdown: Nation records first coronavirus outbreak", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "NEW ZEALAND attracts about 200,000 Brits a year, all eager to explore its picturesque landscape.
