She has partnered with the Pontifical Council for the New Evangelization to host a conference on catechesis for people with disabilities.\n\nThe conference, titled \u201cCatechesis and Persons with Disabilities: A Necessary Engagement in the Daily Pastoral Life of the Church,\u201d will take place Oct. 20-22 at the Pontifical Urbanianum University in Rome.\n\nGangemi told CNA that \u201cto have everybody the same doesn\u2019t celebrate the beauty of diversity, because one thing that we\u2019re all the same in, one true moment of equality, is that we\u2019re all different.\u201d\n\nBut, she said, when people with disabilities participate in parish life, it is sometimes \u201cpresumed by the priest\u2026that they don\u2019t have the learning capacity to be able to be prepared for First Communion or the Sacraments.\u201d\n\nWhile people with disabilities are often described as having \u201clearning difficulties,\u201d Gangemi said the reality is actually the reverse: \u201cthe problem is that there are lots of teaching difficulties.\u201d\n\nShe noted that many resources used in catechetical preparation for the reception of the sacraments are not adapted to the learning styles of intellectually disabled people, who frequently learn best through action, drama, art and music.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve got this paradox. You\u2019ve got people with disabilities who long to receive the sacraments, who from the moment of their conception are touched by God\u2019s grace, and so therefore are called to the sacraments, and then you\u2019ve got this problem in parish structures where nobody really knows how to make all their programs accessible.\u201d\n\nBecause people with disabilities often struggle to learn using traditional methods, \u201cthe presumption is they can\u2019t be catechized.\u201d\n\nThe heart of catechesis and evangelization is essentially \u201cthe echoing down of faith from one generation to another, from one person to another in the parish,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd as for evangelization, everybody, no matter who they are, holds the capacity to be an agent of evangelization.\u201d\n\nPointing to another example, Gangemi recalled the story of a 50-year-old man with disabilities at a parish in London, who at every Mass, during the consecration or when people went up for Communion, would extend his hand toward the altar and make unintelligible sounds.\n\nTypically the man\u2019s caretakers would tell him to be quiet and not to make noise. However, one day as the man was watching others receive Communion, he again reached out his hand and said, \u201cWhy not me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis reaching out for 40-45 years, watching everybody go up to Communion and come back again, was his longing for the Eucharist,\u201d Gangemi said. \u201cAnd if you think of what Jesus did and what Jesus said, he made a special focus on people who are left out.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis lament, \u2018why not me?\u2019 was no different than the psalmists and the people that were exiled. So I think that\u2019s got to stop, my hope is that that will stop, she said.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Pope Francis told an Italian group that excluding anyone from parish life because of a disability is wrong, stressing that it is better to \u201cclose the door\u201d of a parish than to exclude the disabled.\n\nDisability catechesis, Gangemi said, is not simply about making sure people with disabilities have access to the Sacraments, but is more broadly focused on \u201chow can we ensure that every single person, born and baptized, can be an agent of evangelization and can have the faith echoed down to them so that they can echo down the faith to others.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople with disabilities who become active in the Church through their own creative skills then become people that can evangelize to others and call others to salvation,\u201d she said.\n\nThe catechetical conference was proposed in 2016 by Archbishop Rino Fisichella, president of the Council for the New Evangelization, and approved personally by Pope Francis. Gangemi, who has a number of family members with disabilities, was invited to help organize the event because of previous Vatican conferences on disabilities she\u2019d arranged.\n\nSo far, 420 people who work in catechesis have signed up, coming from professions and countries all over the world. Archbishop Fisichella, Baroness Sheila Hollins of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, and representatives from dioceses around the world will present methods for the catechesis of disabled people. Participants will also have an audience with Pope Francis on day two of the event, demonstrating the Pope\u2019s keen interest in the topic.\n\nIn her comments to CNA, Gangemi called the conference \u201chistoric,\u201d since it is among the first global events to address the topic of catechizing those with intellectual disabilities.\n\nGangemi is also partnering with the Archdiocese of Newark\u2019s office for Pastoral Ministry for Persons with Disabilities, to launch a parish training course on catechesis for the disabled.\n\nThe goal, she said, is to engage people so as to \u201ctry to make a shift in the way we see and think\u201d about disability, \u201cbecause the Catholic Church teaches that all life is gift.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our starting point: all life is gift,\u201d she said, and voiced her hope that the conference would be \u201cthe beginning, and that those of us who live now will leave a legacy for those to come, that it won\u2019t die.\u201d\n\n[\u2026]", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/files.catholicworldreport.com/2018/04/cwr-icon.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@cworldreport", "title": "Catholic Archbishop of Minsk calls for end to violence after Belarus election", "description": "CNA Staff, Aug 12, 2020 / 01:01 pm (CNA).- The Archbishop of Minsk-Mohilev called Tuesday for an end to the violent clashes occurring across Belarus following a disputed presidential election.\n\n&ldquo;At this crucial moment in our history, in the name of the God of boundless mercy, love, and peace, I call on all parties to the conflict to end the violence.
