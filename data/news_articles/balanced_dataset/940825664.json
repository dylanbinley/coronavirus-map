Students are selected to become PUPP scholars through a competitive admissions process during ninth grade, and they participate in the program through high school graduation and their transition to college.\n\nMany of the students \u2014 who hail from Ewing, Hamilton, Lawrence Township, Princeton and Trenton \u2014 are the first in their families to attend college.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to replicate being in person,\u201d said Jason Klugman, director of PUPP. \u201cIt\u2019s those small moments in person that create community. But the academic rigor of a PUPP summer is absolutely there.\u201d\n\nThe seven-week program anticipates the students\u2019 personal and academic needs. This year was no exception, taking into consideration what they might require in order to learn from home.\n\nTeaching assistant Germalysa Ferrer, left, a PUPP alumna and member of Princeton\u2019s Class of 2022, checks in with Maia Leonard of Ewing High School, right, at a drive-up station to ensure she has everything she needs to be successful in the program.\n\nBefore orientation, each student received a Chromebook, a laptop computer pillow, calculator, books, sketchpads and a yoga mat. The program also assisted students without reliable internet access to ensure they could participate fully in classes and meetings.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to imagine all the barriers to participation,\u201d Klugman said. \u201cWe tried to think of all the things that would impede on academic and intellectual engagement.\u201d\n\nThe program was especially attuned to students\u2019 wellness this year given the virtual learning environment and the stresses of pandemic life, Klugman said.\n\n\u201cWe altered our schedule and assignments in reaction to the global COVID-19 pandemic, but worked hard to recreate and re-imagine some of the foundational components of the summer, including challenging courses in math, writing, literature, science and sociology, along with our college preparation curriculum, yoga and mindfulness courses, virtual college tours, and more,\u201d Klugman said.\n\nThe virtual format provided some advantages. Authors Angie Cruz and Ernesto Qui\u00f1onez paid a visit to the scholars through Zoom. For their literature class, rising sophomores and seniors read Cruz\u2019s \u201cDominicana\u201d and \u201cLet It Rain Coffee,\u201d respectively. Rising juniors read Qui\u00f1onez\u2019s \u201cChango\u2019s Fire.\u201d\n\nArt classes combined elements of PUPP\u2019s traditional curriculum, while including virtual explorations of artwork and artists. The scholars contributed to a website where they showcased their own work from the summer, incorporating their scholarship and creativity into projects that also served as a much-needed outlet for self-expression, Klugman said.\n\nOver the years, PUPP has become a model for college access programs nationwide.\n\nMost PUPP alumni graduate in the top 10% of their high school class and have a nearly 70% graduation rate at a wide range of selective colleges and universities around the country. The graduation rate is above average for students overall and dramatically higher than the average for students from similar low-income, first-generation backgrounds.\n\nUpon graduating, 2020 PUPP scholars received custom face masks.\n\nPisgah Isabroke, a rising senior at Nottingham High School, said he was grateful that PUPP organizers never considered canceling this year\u2019s program. Although his older brother went to college, they both are first-generation college students and needed guidance navigating the application process.\n\n\u201cI think one thing I\u2019ve gained \u2014 other than my own motivation \u2014 is having this support system around me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have the same goals in mind, so we help each other any way we can.\u201d\n\nMarian Ordonez, a rising senior at Ewing High School, said the program has been challenging, but that\u2019s she\u2019s glad to have been pushed out of her comfort zone.\n\n\u201cComing in sophomore year, I was quiet and reserved,\u201d Ordonez said. \u201cPUPP is always encouraging you to use your voice.\u201d\n\nHer participation also motivated her to apply to two colleges that she never otherwise would have considered: Middlebury and Pomona.\n\n\u201cWithout PUPP, I wouldn\u2019t be thinking of applying to the colleges I\u2019m thinking of applying to right now,\u201d Ordonez said. \u201cOur [high] schools don\u2019t have the resources and the counselors.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Ordonez said she might not have attempted to apply to college or community college at all. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would have pushed myself as hard as I did in school without PUPP,\u201d she added.\n\nSeven of PUPP\u2019s 10 teaching assistants this year were alumni of the program, including Nancy Agosto, a 2018 graduate of Trenton Central High School who attends Muhlenberg College and who served as PUPP\u2019s first teaching assistant in art and literature.\n\nAgosto, an art history major, she said she tried to develop projects that wouldn\u2019t inconvenience students with having to find too many materials. Juniors, for instance, worked on an art project employing digital photography.\n\nAgosto said she is interested in working with high school students eventually, perhaps as a teacher.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always that bit of anxiety that comes with trying to find one\u2019s own identity,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to let students know that if they work hard enough, it will be fruitful.\u201d\n\nPUPP 2020 ended much as it began, with a virtual closing ceremony that highlighted the students\u2019 growth and accomplishments. It came with the usual smiles and tears at a job well-done \u2014 some visible on screen, others shared in a chat box while the ceremony was underway.\n\n\u201cAll of our closing week activities \u2014 the virtual art gallery, literature performances and research symposium \u2014 went on, with updates and innovations to address our current moment,\u201d Klugman said. \u201cNone of us could have imagined a virtual PUPP summer, but we pulled it off and are extremely proud of what we were able accomplish together.\u201d", "METADATA": {"og": {"site_name": "Princeton University", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/08/14/its-20th-year-princeton-university-preparatory-program-brings-enrichment-students", "title": "In its 20th year, Princeton University Preparatory Program brings enrichment to students at home", "description": "Serving low-income, high-achieving\u00a0students from area high schools, the Princeton University Preparatory Program celebrates two decades as a model for college access programs nationwide", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/styles/scale_1440/public/images/2020/08/IMG_0329-MLL-LL2FCRPDalt.jpg?itok=zaWTgLy4", "alt": "Summer teaching assistant for the Princeton University Preparatory Program, prepares backpacks filled with essential supplies for this year\u2019s cohort of PUPP scholars"}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Serving low-income, high-achieving\u00a0students from area high schools, the Princeton University Preparatory Program celebrates two decades as a model for college access programs nationwide", "title": "In its 20th year, Princeton University Preparatory Program brings enrichment to students at home", "site": "@Princeton", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/styles/scale_1440/public/images/2020/08/IMG_0329-MLL-LL2FCRPDalt.jpg?itok=zaWTgLy4,", "alt": "Summer teaching assistant for the Princeton University Preparatory Program, prepares backpacks filled with essential supplies for this year\u2019s cohort of PUPP scholars"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 238312316239555}, "description": "Serving low-income, high-achieving\u00a0students from area high schools, the Princeton University Preparatory Program celebrates two decades as a model for college access programs nationwide", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-config": "/themes/custom/tony/icons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "google-site-verification": "HCFMWeXbGYFnJTWfcWQmuHWebYmZPzueLOKf8RM09I4"}}}
