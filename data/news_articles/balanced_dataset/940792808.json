These issues pertain to the provision of relevant documents as well as providing unimpeded consular access to Kulbhushan,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this month Islamabad High Court (IHC) had formed a larger bench to hear Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, who is on death row in Pakistan.\n\nGeo News had reported that the larger bench, comprising IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Amir Farooq and Justice Mian Gull Hassan Aurangzeb, was formed on Friday and it will hear the case on September 3.\n\nThe decision came after India continued to pressurise Pakistan into allowing consular access to Jadhav.\n\nPakistan media had reported earlier that Islamabad Court has said Indian officials should be given an opportunity to present their stance. India had said that it had not received any communication from Pakistan government.\n\nIndia has also said that Pakistan has blocked all avenues for effective remedy available to it in the case.\n\nPakistan claims that Jadhav was arrested from Balochistan in 2016 on charges of espionage.\n\nIndia has rejected Pakistan's allegations and said he was kidnapped from the Iranian port of Chabahar. In early 2017, a Pakistani military court sentenced him to death.\n\nThe International Court of Justice upheld India's claim that Pakistan has committed an egregious violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations on several counts.
