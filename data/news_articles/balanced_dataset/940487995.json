To accommodate preparation for fully remote learning, the school district has moved the first day of instruction to Sept. 8.\n\nThe first day had been set for Aug. 31. The remainder of the district calendar won\u2019t change.\n\n\u201cI decided we would start the school year fully remote because I believe it\u2019s the best way to protect the health and safety of our scholars, staff, families and community,\u201d district CEO Justin Jennings said. \u201cTo make that happen with as little disruption as possible to scholar learning, the district is providing a device for each and every scholar.\u201d\n\nThe devices will be either Chromebooks or iPads depending on school and grade level.\n\nThe technology staff has worked hard over the past four months to prepare 5,500 iPads and Chromebooks for use at home, John LaPlante, chief information officer, said.\n\n\u201cIn an effort to streamline the process and reduce the number of touchpoints, we implemented an electronic request form that allows parents and guardians to request these devices electronically, and then sign them digitally. We will work in the background to gather all relevant paperwork and create a single point of distribution for everything the scholar will need for the coming year.\u201d\n\nThrough a partnership with the Youngstown Rotary and the Youngstown Foundation, the school district will provide basic home internet access for the 2020-21 school year for students who do not have it.\n\n\u201cOur remote learning plan is designed to meet the needs of all of our scholars,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cThat includes preschoolers, kindergarten through eighth-graders and high school scholars as well as scholars who may require special education services or those in another specialized program.\u201d\n\nThe school schedule will be modified, too.\n\nMondays and Tuesdays will be instructional days and Wednesdays will be reserved for office hours, student independent work time and educator professional development. Instruction will resume on Thursdays and Fridays.\n\n\u201cWe understand that some families and scholars may have a harder time accessing instruction during the typical hours of the school day,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cFor that reason, we\u2019ll be working with our teachers to offer alternate times for instruction to help scholars and families.\u201d\n\nWHAT TO DO\n\n\u201cThis first step is to go to our website to request the device,\u201d Jennings said.\n\nFamilies can visit www.ycsd.org, click the \u201cAbout YCSD\u201d tab and scroll down to \u201cRemote Learning.\u201d From there, families can go to the \u201cDevices\u201d page, and click \u201cRequest My Scholar\u2019s Device.\u201d One request for a device must be submitted per student. A link there also allows families to submit the form in Spanish.\n\nAfter completing the request, the parent / guardian will get a confirmation email. A second email will be sent from the school district when the request is completed. A device cannot be distributed to a scholar until the request is completed so families must wait until they receive the second email.\n\nOnce they receive the second message, they may proceed to their school building between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. and between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on either Aug. 31 or Sept. 1.\n\nTo request home internet access, families also can follow the links for \u201cRemote Learning\u201d under the \u201cAbout YCSD\u201d tab on the website. From there, families will go to the \u201cHome Internet Access\u201d page and click \u201cRequest Home Internet Access.\u201d One request must be submitted per household.\n\nThe district\u2019s remote learning handbook is posted on the district\u2019s home page.\n\nnews@tribtoday.com", "METADATA": {"fb": {"app_id": 492509281298167}, "og": {"title": "City schools start moved to Sept. 8", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.vindy.com/wp-content/themes/coreV3_lazy_vindycustom/images/vindicatorfb.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2020/08/city-schools-start-moved-to-sept-8/", "site_name": "vindy.com", "description": "YOUNGSTOWN \u2014 Youngstown City School District families will be able to pick up district-issued devices Aug. 31 and Sept. 1.
