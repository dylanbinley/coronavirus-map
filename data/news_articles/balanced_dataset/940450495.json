Noble\u2019s Leviathan, one of the world\u2019s biggest offshore gas discoveries of the last decade, is already supplying gas to Israel, Egypt and Jordan.\n\nLISTEN: Trump's tragedy, Netanyahu's debt and Jewish unity Credit: Haaretz\n\nLast year, Noble sought a partner to help finance the multibillion-dollar investment required for Leviathan, according to Tuesday\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission filing.\n\nThe company denied Chevron an opportunity to visit the Leviathan facility in February, but weeks later agreed to a confidentiality agreement to begin discussing their operations in the region, according to the filing.\n\nAs global energy markets collapsed that month and Noble reported a first-quarter loss of nearly $4 billion, its board opted for a sale of the company rather than a regional partnership, according to the filing.\n\nIt contacted eight companies to gauge interest in a stake in its Eastern Mediterranean holdings and held talks with six potential buyers. The alternatives to Chevron were either \u201chigh risk\u201d or \u201cdid not result in any material benefit,\u201d according to the filing.\n\nChevron\u2019s bid valued Noble at $10.38 a share, a 7.5% premium to its closing price before the deal was disclosed. Including assumption of debt, the price tag for the purchase is roughly $13 billion.\n\nDuring their talks, Chevron agreed to raise its exchange ratio while Noble dropped a force-the-vote provision and agreed to pay a higher termination fee if the deal did not close.\n\nThe purchase still faces a vote by Noble shareholders, who are expected to approve it. Chevron shares on Tuesday were off 6 cents at $89.67 while Noble\u2019s lost 4 cents at $10.65. The proxy filing came after 4 p.m.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "fb": {"pages": 82903654348, "app_id": 287530407927859}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#0B7EB5", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/hdc/images/mstile-144x144.png", "referrer": "always", "robots": "noarchive", "isPremiumContent": "true", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "published": "2020-08-12T23:15:00.000Z"}, "og": {"site_name": "Haaretz.com", "title": "Chevron\u2019s interest in giant gas field led to $5 billion bid for Noble Energy", "description": "***", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-chevron-s-interest-in-giant-gas-field-led-to-5-billion-bid-for-noble-energy-1.9068441", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.haarets.co.il/image/fetch/x_0,y_0,w_2200,h_1281,c_crop/q_auto,h_698,w_1200,c_fill,f_auto/fl_lossy.any_format.preserve_transparency.progressive:none/https://www.haaretz.co.il/polopoly_fs/1.7091475!/image/3691357106.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "title": "Chevron\u2019s interest in giant gas field led to $5 billion bid for Noble Energy - Business", "description": "Noble\u2019s Leviathan, one of the world\u2019s biggest offshore gas discoveries of the last decade, is already supplying gas to Israel, Egypt and Jordan", "keywords": "Israel business news,  Israel economy", "ob": {"title": "Chevron\u2019s interest in giant gas field led to $5 billion bid for Noble Energy"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@haaretzcom", "title": "Chevron\u2019s interest in giant gas field led to $5 billion bid for Noble Energy", "description": "***", "image": "https://images.haarets.co.il/image/fetch/x_0,y_0,w_2200,h_1281,c_crop/q_auto,h_698,w_1200,c_fill,f_auto/fl_lossy.any_format.preserve_transparency.progressive:none/https://www.haaretz.co.il/polopoly_fs/1.7091475!/image/3691357106.jpg"}, "next-head-count": 22}}}
