You hear of these things happening, but you never think it\u2019s going to happen to you.\u201d\n\nThumser was at Henry Ford Allegiance Health on Sunday, Aug. 9, ready to deliver the baby. But she left around 10:30 p.m. because, although she was having contractions, other signs showed the baby wasn\u2019t quite ready to come yet.\n\nBy 1:30 a.m. the next day, her contractions had intensified. Still, Thumser said she and her husband Russell didn\u2019t rush back to the hospital because her previous labors had taken a while.\n\nBut, when she got sick in the yard as they were leaving, Thumser knew they wouldn\u2019t make it in time. They called 911.\n\n\u201c(When the ambulance arrived) I was like, \u2018Come on, you got to hurry up,\u2019\u201d Thumser said. \u201c... Thankfully they got me in the ambulance. It was a matter of minutes.\u201d\n\nWhen the paramedics examined Thumser, it was time for her to push, paramedic Shannon Coleman said. She gave birth to Russell Thumser Jr. in the ambulance in her driveway at 2:42 a.m.\n\nNeither Coleman, nor her partner had delivered a baby before.\n\n\u201cWe see a lot of different things in the ambulance but to deliver a healthy baby, and the mom healthy, it made me feel like I was on cloud nine,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cEveryone was happy. It was just a surreal experience.\u201d\n\nThere wasn\u2019t time to give Thumser pain medicine and it was her first birth without it, she told Coleman.\n\n\u201cShe was a champ, man,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cNo pain meds. \u2026 She made it look easy. I know she was in a lot of pain and I know it\u2019s not ideal to deliver in the back of an ambulance but she is a champ.\u201d\n\nThe paramedics stayed calm throughout the birth, which Thumser said she appreciated.\n\n\u201cIt was absolutely amazing how calm they were,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were both super giddy because \u2013 they\u2019re trained for it \u2013 but neither one had experienced it.\u201d\n\nLittle Russell was seven weeks premature and weighed 4 pounds, 14 ounces. So, he\u2019s currently in the neonatal intensive care unit at Henry Ford Allegiance Health,\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing great,\u201d Thumser said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing really, really well.\u201d\n\nRead more from MLive:\n\nMichigan woman celebrating 105th birthday with help of community\n\nIndependent candidate running for Jackson County sheriff\n\nMeterless parking continues downtown, 1 street assessment passes but 3 fail at Jackson council meeting\n\nJackson\u2019s interim city manager appointed to full-time position\n\nJackson ax-throwing bar builds outdoor lanes for use during pandemic", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435, "app_id": 132720883409479}, "title": "Paramedics deliver \u2018driveway baby\u2019 when Michigan mom can\u2019t make it to hospital", "og": {"title": "Paramedics deliver \u2018driveway baby\u2019 when Michigan mom can\u2019t make it to hospital", "url": "https://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/2020/08/paramedics-deliver-driveway-baby-when-michigan-mom-cant-make-it-to-hospital.html", "site_name": "mlive", "type": "article", "description": "Little Russell was seven weeks premature and weighed 4 pounds, 14 ounces.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.mlive.com/resizer/YBPqqtJknTwKMiHfeFtOWEQPvqA=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/ZUQULKEL5BBGVN7FMN4V76OYDY.jpg", "width": 1280}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T13:19:50.973Z", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T13:19:50.973Z", "section": "Jackson", "tag": "@mlive-app,@mlive-river,@jx-river,@jx-app,@subscriberexclusive"}, "twitter": {"title": "Paramedics deliver \u2018driveway baby\u2019 when Michigan mom can\u2019t make it to hospital", "site": "@mlive", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Little Russell was seven weeks premature and weighed 4 pounds, 14 ounces.", "image": "https://www.mlive.com/resizer/YBPqqtJknTwKMiHfeFtOWEQPvqA=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/ZUQULKEL5BBGVN7FMN4V76OYDY.jpg"}, "article_publication_name": "https://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/2020/08/paramedics-deliver-driveway-baby-when-michigan-mom-cant-make-it-to-hospital.html", "article_date_original": "Friday, August 14, 2020, 09:19 AM", "article_date_updated": "Friday, August 14, 2020, 09:19 AM", "sailthru.tags": "jackson,jackson county,thumser,michigan,ambulance,baby,kristy thumser,shannon coleman", "sailthru.date": "Friday, August 14, 2020, 09:19 AM", "sailthru.title": "Paramedics deliver \u2018driveway baby\u2019 when Michigan mom can\u2019t make it to hospital", "sailthru.author": "mweidmay", "sailthru.description": "Little Russell was seven weeks premature and weighed 4 pounds, 14 ounces.", "machine_tags": "@mlive-app,@mlive-river,@jx-river,@jx-app,@subscriberexclusive", "sections": "news,news/jackson", "byline": "Marie Weidmayer | mweidmay@mlive.com", "subscriber_only": "true", "Description": "Little Russell was seven weeks premature and weighed 4 pounds, 14 ounces.", "article_author": "Marie Weidmayer | mweidmay@mlive.com"}}}
