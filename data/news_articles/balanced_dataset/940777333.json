In March 2020, Kenya became the latest African country to ban the export of donkey products, following pressure from farmers' lobbies and animal rights groups. In the wake of the ban, three Kenyan slaughterhouses took the government to court.\n\nAfter licensing its first donkey abattoir in 2016, Kenya became an epicentre in Africa for the multimillion-dollar export of donkey skins to China.
