Several weeks ago, veteran PLO spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi took on Dore Gold, former director-general of Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry, during a one-hour webinar hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nJoining them was Martin S. Indyk, former US ambassador to Israel and now a distinguished fellow at CFR. Some 400 people watched via Zoom as New York Times reporter Farah Stockman moderated the July 29 debate.\n\n\u201cI was in Jerusalem in 2011, and a Jewish Israeli told me at the time that the conflict is like two guys arguing over a pizza. And meanwhile, one of them is eating the pizza,\u201d said Stockman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who\u2019s been covering the conflict since 2005. \u201cI\u2019m just wondering if annexation is the moment we look down at the box and realize there\u2019s not much pizza left.\u201d\n\nIndeed, from Ashrawi\u2019s point of view, only the crust remains.\n\n\u201cUnilaterally, Israel has been destroying the [two-state solution] through a process of settlement activities that has superimposed a grid on the West Bank that prevents normal life,\u201d said Ashrawi, whose official title is head of the PLO\u2019s Department of Public Diplomacy and Policy. \u201cAnnexation means the Israeli settlers have full rights, and they terrorize the Palestinian people, especially in rural areas and in remote villages. Israel is also taking the most fertile areas of the West Bank, controlling all freedom of movement.\u201d\n\nFor Gold, however, it comes down to a \u201cbattle over political terminology,\u201d in his words.\n\n\u201cToday, we\u2019re considering if the term \u2018annexation\u2019 even applies to recent Israeli proposals to extend Israeli sovereignty to parts of Judea and Samaria in the context of the American peace plan,\u201d said Gold, president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs and Israel\u2019s envoy to the UN from 1997 to 1999. He noted that the International Committee of the Red Cross defines annexation as a unilateral act of a state through which it proclaims its sovereignty over the territory of another state.\n\n\u201cThe obvious question is whether the West Bank was the territory of another state,\u201d he said. \u201cThis may be tedious, but those are the facts we have to contend with.\u201d\n\nSemantics aside, Ashrawi said Netanyahu\u2019s proposed move \u201ctells the world and the Palestinian people that this is not a temporary occupation, but a situation where the occupying power is violating the most basic rights of the Palestinian people.\u201d\n\nSpeaking from Ramallah \u2014 de facto capital of the Palestinian Authority \u2014 Ashrawi said the annexation has been going on for a long time. \u201cI know people were shocked that finally Netanyahu came out and openly said he wants to annex this ingeniously. He\u2019s going to extend Israeli law back. But the question is, Israel \u2014 at its core \u2014 has been based on annexation, on appropriation of land and resources, and on creating facts illegally.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 11, the prime minister essentially blamed Washington for the delay in annexing up to 30% of the West Bank, including all Israeli settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley \u2014areas that Trump\u2019s much-hyped \u201cdeal of the century\u201d envisions Israel keeping.\n\nBut the coronavirus pandemic, which has now claimed 166,000 American lives, has taken precedence, as has nationwide racial tensions and a US economy in free fall.\n\n\u201cIt was clear from the start that the application of sovereignty would be done only with agreement from the White House. Otherwise, I would have already done it awhile ago,\u201d Netanyahu told Israel\u2019s Channel 20, adding that \u201cTrump is now busy with other things, and this is not on the top of his mind.\u201d\n\nYet it might be, if a desperate Trump sees his poll numbers tanking and thinks an annexation might generate excitement among evangelicals come Election Day.\n\n\u201cAs polls show him continually trailing Biden by 5 to 8 percentage points, including in most swing states, and as a large majority of Americans say they disapprove of his management of the coronavirus pandemic, Trump\u2019s best chance of eking out a narrow victory is to boost enthusiasm among his base so that they turn out to vote in disproportionate numbers,\u201d argues Dan Shapiro, former US ambassador to Israel.\n\nWriting in Foreign Policy magazine, Shapiro said: \u201cTrump\u2019s quest for political survival may impel him to try to force through an annexation that Israelis have not embraced. In this scenario, Trump would essentially tell Kushner: \u2018Tell Bibi to annex something. Don\u2019t bother me with the details.\u2019\u201d\n\nUnder the Trump plan, said Gold, \u201cIsrael gets 30% of the West Bank, the Palestinians get 70%. So it is not as though we\u2019re taking all the gold coins and leaving them with rubbish.\u201d He added: \u201cIt takes two to tango, and we\u2019re ready to dance.\u201d\n\nActually, it takes three to tango, retorted Indyk, who served as US ambassador to Israel from 1995 to 1997, and again from 2000 to 2001.\n\n\u201cBut in this case, the tango is only between the United States and Israel. The Palestinians have been excluded from this process,\u201d Indyk said. \u201cThe only difference with the Trump plan [and previous negotiations] is that it\u2019s going to fail differently. And it\u2019s still failing and cannot succeed because it\u2019s so fundamentally tilted in Israel\u2019s favor.\u201d\n\nThe Israelis and Palestinians don\u2019t seem any closer to resolving their age-old dispute than they did in the early 1990s, when the Oslo accords were cause for optimism. In fact, plenty of pundits on both sides have declared the two-state solution as an anachronism that has long since been rendered irrelevant by facts on the ground.\n\nEven so, Indyk refuses to accept the notion that the two-state solution is dead.\n\n\u201cBut it certainly is on life support at the moment, and it would be a tragedy for Israelis, as well as for Palestinians, if we were now to pull the plug, because the notion of equal rights in one state \u2014 or what\u2019s referred to as a one-state solution \u2014 is not a solution at all,\u201d Indyk warned. \u201cIt\u2019s an illusion, and a recipe only for continued conflict.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/images/toi_icon_144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 123142304440875}, "og": {"url": "https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/israeli-plo-reps-square-off-in-virtual-debate-on-annexation/", "type": "article", "title": "Israeli, PLO reps square off in virtual debate on annexation", "description": "From the blog of Larry Luxner at The Times of Israel", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/blogs/uploads/2020/08/CFRwebinar.jpg", "width": 1800, "height": 988}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/luxner", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/timesofisrael"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "timesofisrael", "title": "Israeli, PLO reps square off in virtual debate on annexation", "description": "From the blog of Larry Luxner at The Times of Israel", "image": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/blogs/uploads/2020/08/CFRwebinar.jpg", "creator": "lluxner"}, "outbrain": {"site": "www"}, "description": "From the blog of Larry Luxner at The Times of Israel", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": true, "NOTES": []}}
