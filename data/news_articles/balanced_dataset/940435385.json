A year on, she believes the same.\n\n\u201cI felt this within two minutes of discovering that she wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Meabh said. \u201cThis was before I could even absorb what was really happening. I just knew.\u201d\n\nOne year ago \u2013 on August 13th \u2013 N\u00f3ra\u2019s body was found in the jungle about 2km from the Dusun resort where she had been staying with her parents and two younger siblings. The Franco-Irish teenager had been missing for 10 days.\n\nMeabh and N\u00f3ra\u2019s father, Sebastien, hope now that a hard-won inquest in Malaysia, which will start later this month, will finally answer some of the family\u2019s questions.\n\nPoignantly, Thursday is also the day the Malaysian coroner and her team are visiting the Dusun and inspecting the place where N\u00f3ra\u2019s body was found by a group of hikers who had volunteered to join the search. The location had already been scoured many times during a massive search-and-rescue operation.\n\nSixty-seven people, including the Quoirins, will give evidence at the inquest, scheduled to start on August 24th. \u201cWhat we want is that no family would ever go through what we\u2019ve had to go through,\u201d Meabh told The Irish Times.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re looking for is an acknowledgement of the numerous possibilities, and a far greater emphasis on who N\u00f3ra was and why it is just impossible to believe certain theories about what might have happened to her.\u201d\n\nMeabh and Sebastien remain convinced that their 15-year-old daughter, a vulnerable girl with special needs, who would not go outside her own front door alone, could not have reached the spot where she was found on her own.\n\nTime and evidence lost\n\nThey say that crucial time and evidence was lost because the Malaysian police insisted on treating her disappearance as a case of a missing person, not a crime.\n\n\u201cThe first two days were catastrophic,\u201d Sebastien said. \u201cIt was utter chaos.\u201d Forensic tests were only done in the chalet occupied by the Quoirins three days after their daughter had disappeared.\n\nA year on, the Quoirins are coping: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of support from family, friends, professionals and strangers who continue to write to us and visit N\u00f3ra\u2019s grave, but, in the end, I\u2019m still absolutely devastated,\u201d Meabh said.\n\n\u201cWe miss her every minute of every day. It\u2019s my little girl; you can\u2019t get past that. It feels like it happened yesterday,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Quoirins say they do not want foul play to be ruled out by the coroner. The lack of evidence that there was foul play does not mean that that there was not any, Meabh says. \u201cFor us it\u2019s important that the case stays open in case someone speaks up in the future,\u201d Sebastien said.\n\nOne question that has not yet been answered is whether N\u00f3ra died where she was found, or whether her body was moved there.\n\nThere were no marks of struggle on N\u00f3ra\u2019s body. Nor was there evidence of violence. However, this does not prove that she was not abducted, Meabh says. \u201cN\u00f3ra would never have struggled; that wasn\u2019t her nature,\u201d she said.\n\nN\u00f3ra\u2019s body was found naked. \u201cWe have asked many times if the briefs she was wearing were ever found and we have had no response,\u201d Sebastien said.\n\nThe way in which cases like N\u00f3ra\u2019s disappearance are handled in Malaysia needs to be changed completely, the Quoirins say.\n\n\u201cThe morning after N\u00f3ra\u2019s body was found, our police liaison officer was taken off the case, and very quickly the case was classified as \u2018no further action\u2019,\u201d Meabh said.\n\nThe Malaysian postmortem was completed in November, but the report was not released to the Quoirins until May. A second postmortem was carried out in Britain, but this shed no new light.\n\n\u201cThey were really only able to agree with the conclusion of the Malaysian report on the cause of death, which was upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to a duodenal ulcer complicated with perforation,\u201d Meabh said.\n\nDate of death\n\nThe Malaysian pathologists dated N\u00f3ra\u2019s death to two or three days, and no more than four days, before her body was found.\n\nSebastien says police from France, Britain and Ireland offered help: \u201cWe don\u2019t know to what extent those offers of assistance were taken up,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe know that there was a very rudimentary campsite very near to where N\u00f3ra was found and the French police suggested taking samples from the area for DNA testing. We don\u2019t know if those samples were ever obtained.\u201d\n\nThe campsite looked like it had been occupied recently, the Quoirins say, with rubbish and evidence of a fire.\n\nN\u00f3ra\u2019s body was not sunburned, and there were no mosquito bites. \u201cThere were only a few abrasions visible on her feet,\u201d Sebastien said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t fit the argument that she was out in the jungle by herself for seven days.\u201d\n\nSebastien points out that a wide radius around the Dusun was repeatedly and very thoroughly searched and every river and stream near the resort was scoured, but N\u00f3ra\u2019s body was found by volunteers, near to a stream.\n\n\u201cWe wonder how it is the search-and-rescue teams didn\u2019t find her,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we see it, it is likely that she simply wasn\u2019t there, and at some point was brought there.\u201d\n\nThe Quoirins say they believe someone gave N\u00f3ra water. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that she would have drunk from a stream; we don\u2019t believe N\u00f3ra would have easily made it to a stream,\u201d Meabh said.\n\n\u201cWhile someone with survival instincts would know to travel downwards, and to try to find water, N\u00f3ra would never have wanted to leave a known path and suddenly go into the jungle in the hope that she would find water or food. She wouldn\u2019t have known she needed to do that to survive.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Malaysian postmortem report, no organisms from the water in the specific stream where N\u00f3ra was found were present in her body.\n\nThe terrain next to the Dusun is incredibly steep, Sebastien says. \u201cIf she had taken the main path, she would have been spotted and, if she had crossed the abandoned palm oil plantation, she would have been seen during the search.\u201d\n\nEven if N\u00f3ra had, by mistake, gone outside of the Dusun chalet by herself, there is no way she would have gone far, Sebastien says. \u201cHad she gone three metres, she would have tripped and seriously hurt herself. There was total darkness. There was not even any moon that night.\n\n\u201cNormally, when there was an element of uncertainty, N\u00f3ra would just freeze. It is totally impossible to conceive of her going further than just a few metres.\u201d\n\nOpen window\n\nThe lounge window in the chalet was found to be ajar when N\u00f3ra went missing. The latch on the window was broken, so somebody could have pulled it open from outside and got in.\n\n\u201cSomebody opened that window,\u201d Meabh said, \u201cand it wasn\u2019t us.\u201d\n\nMeabh says N\u00f3ra brought a very unique contribution to family conversations. \u201cShe rarely left my side. Having her innocent chatting through every situation was always wonderful, always different.\n\n\u201cIt is wonderful how a little girl as fragile as N\u00f3ra was has touched the world. I believe her gifts to us will live on through us. We are determined that the world will know that you don\u2019t give up just because somebody doesn\u2019t have the strongest voice.\u201d\n\nThe last family photograph the Quoirin family have with N\u00f3ra, at Maurice\u2019s first Communion on June 16th, 2019. Photograph: Supplied\n\nChildren with special needs do not have an ego or an agenda, Meabh says. \u201cThey just accept people as they are. I really miss that deep love and affection, and her companionship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fighting to get N\u00f3ra what she needed from the day she was born and I\u2019m not going to stop that now, but the pain is huge. It\u2019s immeasurable really.\u201d\n\nMeabh says N\u00f3ra\u2019s siblings \u2013 Maurice, aged nine, and Innes, aged 13 \u2013 are very resilient. \u201cWe are making a memory log of all our best memories of N\u00f3ra. The children look back and think of all the ways in which N\u00f3ra made them smile. She was funny and quirky with them and they remember and cherish that.\n\n\u201cShe is very much alive as part of our family. We\u2019ll always be a family of five.\u201d", "METADATA": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "description": "N\u00f3ra\u2019s parents hope a hard-won inquest in Malaysia will answer some of their questions", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom14328667"}, "news_keywords": "News, Annette Gartland, Meabh Quoirin, Nora Quoirin, French Police, Malaysian Police, Meabh, NORA, France, Ireland, Malaysia, United Kingdom", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "all", "og": {"title": "A year after N\u00f3ra Quoirin\u2019s body was found, her parents still believe she was abducted", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/a-year-after-n%C3%B3ra-quoirin-s-body-was-found-her-parents-still-believe-she-was-abducted-1.4328667", "site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "N\u00f3ra\u2019s parents hope a hard-won inquest in Malaysia will answer some of their questions", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4328641&origw=1440", "secure_url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4328641&origw=1440", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IrishTimes", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/a-year-after-n%C3%B3ra-quoirin-s-body-was-found-her-parents-still-believe-she-was-abducted-1.4328667", "title": "A year after N\u00f3ra Quoirin\u2019s body was found, her parents still believe she was abducted", "description": "N\u00f3ra\u2019s parents hope a hard-won inquest in Malaysia will answer some of their questions", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4328641.1597262069!/image/image.jpg", "account_id": 15084853}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "fb": {"pages": 45441411157, "app_id": 1170474839675514}}}}
