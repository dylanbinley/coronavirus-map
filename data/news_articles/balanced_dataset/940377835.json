But holding any kind of human chain and political programme on the issue of suspension of the corona health update is likely to spike further infection of the deadly virus, he added.\n\nRegarding up-gradation of Dhaka-Sylhet highway into four-lane, the road transport and bridges minister said the work of turning the long-awaited Dhaka-Sylhet highway into four-lane will begin soon.\n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has finalized the financing for developing the highway, he continued.\n\nOn the allegations of hiked bus fare and flouting of health guidelines amid the corona pandemic, Quader said some of the public transports are not strictly maintaining the government rules terming it as very unfortunate.\n\nThe public transports have been asked to keep almost 50 percent seat vacant, but they are not maintaining the rules, said the minister.\n\nQuader asked the law enforcement agencies and the BRTA to take strict action against those transport companies out to flout government rules.\n\nAdditional Secretary of Road Transport and Highway Division Chandan Kumar Dey, Chief Engineer of Road and Highway Department M Shahriar Hossen, Additional Chief Engineer of Sylhet Road Zone Tushar Kanti Saha and BRTA and BRTC officials, among others, joined the video conference.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "http://www.bssnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Minister-Obaidul-Quader..jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.0.10", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.bssnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cropped-BSS-Final-Logo-300x300.jpg"}}}
