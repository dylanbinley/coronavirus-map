Among the warships taking part were Greek frigates and a French task force. The exercise included progressive drills, joint operational planning, tactical image exchange, communications, aircraft cooperation to raise the level of operational readiness and combat capability among other activities.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday was also briefed by Mr Mitsotakis on the latest developments in the region ahead of an extraordinary online meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council on Friday.\n\nMs Merkel had previously spoken to Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as well as European Council President Charles Michel in an effort to stave of conflict.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018Greece can\u2019t be blackmailed\u2019, says Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis during visit to Germany\n\nGerman newspaper Tagesspiegel published an op-ed piece on the situation in the area, and expressed certainty that NATO would eventually be compelled to act as a mediator in the crisis.
