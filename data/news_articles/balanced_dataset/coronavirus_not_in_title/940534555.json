The figures also suggest that the outbreaks we are seeing in other countries such as Belgium, France and Spain aren\u2019t having an effect here in the UK yet.\n\n\u201cOn top of this, the hot weather which caused concern by making many flock to crowded beaches and parks doesn\u2019t seem to be having the predicted negative impact.\n\n\u201cOverall, we are pleasantly surprised by the figures this week, which are back down to the early July levels and hope that the good news continues.\u201d\n\nThe Covid Symptom Study app\u2019s Watch List highlights key areas of concern so they can be focused on.\n\nThis week a number of new locations have made the list, including the first area in Scotland, Dumfries and Galloway, Thurrock in Essex, and more regions in the North of England, St Helens, Middlesbrough, Blackpool and Lancashire.\n\nBlackburn with Darwen has fallen from the top spot to sixth in the table, while Halton in Merseyside has moved to the top slot, making it the one to watch.\n\nWhen an area of concern is highlighted, it means enhanced testing can take place to help confirm if the situation needs further action such as a localised lockdown.\n\nDeveloped by healthcare science company, ZOE, the Covid Symptom Study app has been downloaded by more than 3.9 million people in the UK.\n\nData collected is shared with and analysed by King\u2019s College London.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "OMG-Verify-V1": "4389-366acdfc-5224-4c07-bb70-f74d8fbfc2db", "og": {"url": "https://www.bracknellnews.co.uk/news/national/18648951.latest-figures-confirm-uk-not-beginning-second-wave-says-expert/", "site_name": "Bracknell News", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.bracknellnews.co.uk/resources/images/11646739/", "width": 2400, "height": 1600}, "title": "Latest figures confirm UK \u2018not at beginning of second wave\u2019, says expert", "type": "website", "name": "Latest figures confirm UK \u2018not at beginning of second wave\u2019, says expert", "description": "There were 1,434 daily new Covid-19 cases in the UK on average over the two weeks up to August 8."}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.bracknellnews.co.uk/resources/images/11646739/"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Latest figures confirm UK \u2018not at beginning of second wave\u2019, says expert", "description": "There were 1,434 daily new Covid-19 cases in the UK on average over the two weeks up to August 8."}, "fb": {"app_id": 1666190920261784, "pages": 795330003870917}, "medium": "news", "title": "Latest figures confirm UK \u2018not at beginning of second wave\u2019, says expert", "description": "There were 1,434 daily new Covid-19 cases in the UK on average over the two weeks up to August 8."}}}
