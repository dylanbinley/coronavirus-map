(Photo by Maciek Musialek/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nPassengers travelling to Europe via Eurostar have described the effect on their travel plans following changes to quarantine restrictions announced on Thursday night.\n\nSome passengers are pressing ahead with their plans to travel into France and the Netherlands despite the announcement that from 4am on Saturday, August 15 anyone returning to the UK from those countries will have to quarantine for 14 days.\n\nOthers, however, decided to cancel their trips at the last minute following the news.\n\n\u2018We can\u2019t cancel the wedding\u2019\n\nOne couple, who are due to get married in The Netherlands next month, said they have already had relatives cancel after announcement, which also includes Monaco, Malta, Turks and Caicos and Aruba.\n\nElske Koelman, 29 and her fianc\u00e9 Bertie Chambers, 33, were en route to The Netherlands on Friday morning to finalise plans for their wedding in Leiden next month.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Yahoo! News UK Bertie Lawrence, 33, and Elske Koelman, 29, are sticking to their plans to travel to the Netherlands to prepare for their wedding next month, but many relatives have had to cancel. (SWNS)\n\nThe couple, both management consultants living in the UK, had to reduce their wedding guest list from 130 to 20 due to the pandemic but the new quarantine rule now means it is likely only half of those invited will be able to attend, with Chambers\u2019 aunt and cousins unable to travel due to the quarantine.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis morning we have had calls from my side of the family cancelling: so far my brother and my aunt cannot make it. My mum and dad are retired so luckily they can make it.\n\n\u201cWe are going to the Netherlands today to finalise all the details. We have to speak to the venue, the florist and the restaurant especially because of the quarantine now.\u201d\n\nAfter learning of new travel restrictions last night, Koelman packed her laptop for their initial trip to Leiden today so she can stay there until the wedding to avoid a double quarantine, but her fiance will return to the UK and quarantine for two weeks before travelling back to the Netherlands for the big day.\n\nChambers added: \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything about it, it is out of our hands. We can\u2019t cancel the wedding and our plans should still go ahead.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put your life on hold. We\u2019re lucky we can both work from home so it\u2019s worthwhile to get married even if we have to quarantine when we get back.\u201d\n\n\u2018An informed risk\u2019\n\nRobert Lawrence, 65, from Islington in north London, also decided to stick to his plans to travel on the Eurostar on Friday to visit friends in the Netherlands and Germany.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Yahoo! News UK Retired broadcast worker Robert Lawrence still plans to travel to visit friends. (SWNS)\n\nHe said: \u201cObviously it is a risk but I have probably taken more of a risk going around the supermarket than I am doing this.\n\n\u201cIf you are bending down to the shelves in busy shops, it is probably more of a risk than this trip with socially distanced walks and alfresco meals.\n\n\u201cMy main concern was travel insurance and health cover. My policy said it does not cover travel if the Foreign Commonwealth Office our restrictions in place before I took out the policy or before I booked it.\n\n\u201cBut I had booked it all already so it seems I am still covered and I will just quarantine when I\u2019m back.\u201d\n\nHe said he was aware restrictions might change and saw it as an \u201cinformed risk\u201d, adding: \u201cWe decided to go ahead because the new restrictions were only announced last night so it was very very short notice for us.\n\n\u201cEverything had already been booked and we knew about the advice so we are relatively happy.\n\n\u201cI can quarantine when I return and I have a local supermarket that deliver food and a friend who has offered to drop things to me if needed.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s going to be catastrophic\u2019\n\nLawyer John Strange, from Reading was also planning to continue with his journey to Paris on Friday morning, with plans to stay for 10 days.\n\nThe 60-year-old, who said he can work from home on his return, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a disaster for me but it seems for many people it will be, particularly those with young families, it\u2019s going to be catastrophic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure many will have to cancel their plans and have to accept all that pain and cost that goes with it.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Yahoo! News UK Retired accountant Richard Wilkins, 83, from Dorset was trying to get onto an earlier Eurostar train to pass through France into Switzerland before the quarantine restrictions become enforced. (SWNS)\n\nRichard Wilkins, 83, arrived at St Pancras International station three hours early for his Eurostar train to Paris in the hope he could switch to an earlier train and pass through France into Switzerland before 4am on Saturday when the rules come into play.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are hoping to get through France before 4am tomorrow, but I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019ll be able to do it.\n\n\u201cThe original plan was to spend tonight in Paris and travel onto Basel tomorrow morning but we are hoping to travel straight through today.\n\n\u201cWe are also talking about flying back direct from Switzerland and avoiding France altogether.\n\n\u201cThe return is booked in 12 days time back through Paris via Eurostar. But if the travel restrictions are still in place then, we might have to lose our return tickets and fly home.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not worth it\u2019\n\nA traveller who gave her name as Sonata K, a 39-year-old dentist, was due to head to Paris for four nights with her mother \u2013 but cancelled her plans after finding out about the quarantine measures at St Pancras on Friday morning.\n\nShe told PA: \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it to go out and have to self isolate. With my work I can\u2019t do the procedures from home.\n\n\u201cWe were too late to get the news, we\u2019re just finding out here but it\u2019s better than on the train.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at going to Cardiff and checking trains now, but the weather is changing a bit.\u201d\n\nShe added that for \u00a330 they could change their Eurostar tickets to another day and said one hotel had charged them one night\u2019s stay for late cancellation.\n\nCoronavirus: what happened today\n\nClick here to sign up to the latest news and information with our daily Catch-up newsletter", "METADATA": {"application-name": "'You can't put your life on hold': Eurostar passengers juggle travel plans following quarantine announcement", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "Politics", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Passengers travelling to Europe via Eurostar have described the effect on their travel plans following changes to quarantine restrictions announced on Thursday night.
