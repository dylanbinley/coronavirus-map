(Courtesy: Elli Kriel)\n\nKriel, who is originally from South Africa, said she was excited by the peace treaty, which she said paves the way for positive developments in the Middle East.\n\nTo the news of the setting up of direct flights between UAE and Israel, she said: \u201cI am ready to embrace Israeli visitors into the UAE and share with them the delights of my Emirati-influenced Kosher cuisine and appreciation of my adopted home.\u201d\n\nKriel\u2019s husband Ross, who is president of the Jewish Council of the Emirates (JCE), said the announcement \u201creflects the extent to which the UAE has demonstrated sustained courage and pragmatism in seeking opportunities for peace and economic development in the region.\u201d\n\nElli Kriel, second left, and her husband Ross, far left, sample some of her dishes with friends in Dubai.

(AFP)\n\n\u201cWhat excites me most about the agreement is the potential to collaborate on education and culture,\u201d Rabbi Sarna added.\n\nIsraeli and Emirati delegations are set to meet in the coming weeks to establish bilateral agreements on a range of issues including education, culture, tourism, telecommunications, and healthcare.\n\nIt is Israel\u2019s first peace treaty with an Arab country in 25 years.\n\nHope for Israeli-Palestinian peace\n\nDavid Zabinsky, a young American who moved to Dubai five years ago, said he hopes the diplomatic breakthrough would serve as a bridge to \u201cenduring cooperation between Israel and the entire Arab world starting with a symbiotic peace agreement between Israel and Palestine,\u201d he told Al Arabiya English.\n\nIn exchange for full diplomatic relations with the UAE, Israel has pledged to halt annexation of Palestinian territory in the occupied West Bank.\n\nPalestinians demonstrate in front of Israeli bulldozers that were bulldozing land outside Deir Qaddis village near Ramallah for an apparent plan to expand a nearby Jewish settlement. (AP)\n\nZabinsky said some of his closest friends in Dubai are Emirati and Palestinian and that he hopes the new agreement breaks down \u201cwalls between communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI envision Jews and Muslims throughout the UAE and the region having Shabbat dinners and Ramadan iftars together \u2013 realizing there is far more that brings us together than pushes us apart,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nUAE refuses to be silent while religion \u2018hijacked and politicized\u2019: Ambassador to US\n\nBeirut explosion: Lebanese community ships 138 tonnes of glass to Beirut from UAE\n\nLebanon\u2019s people are calling out the disease of corruption, but say cure out of reach\n\nLast Update: Friday, 14 August 2020 KSA 23:18 - GMT 20:18", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Elli Kriel, founder of the first Jewish kosher eatery in the UAE, had just exchanged traditional Arabic food with an Emirati client on Thursday when she he", "robots": "all", "aa": {"contenttype": "news", "contentid": "ad858405-e206-4a45-aa6d-f4f3e061a065", "created": 1597344600000, "modified": 1597349909137}, "gwt": {"property": "locale=en"}, "fb": {"pages": 114884335231354}, "thumbnail": "https://vid.alarabiya.net/images/2020/08/13/5d3bdd02-8308-41cc-8fd7-dd0a0326d05e/5d3bdd02-8308-41cc-8fd7-dd0a0326d05e_4x3_186x139.jpg", "uuid": "ad858405-e206-4a45-aa6d-f4f3e061a065", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T22:50:00.000+0400", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T00:18:29.137+0400", "section": "Features"}, "og": {"image": "https://vid.alarabiya.net/images/2020/08/13/5d3bdd02-8308-41cc-8fd7-dd0a0326d05e/5d3bdd02-8308-41cc-8fd7-dd0a0326d05e_16x9_600x338.jpg", "title": "UAE\u2019s Jewish community reacts to country\u2019s historic agreement with Israel", "description": "Elli Kriel, founder of the first Jewish kosher eatery in the UAE, had just exchanged traditional", "url": "https://english.alarabiya.net/en/features/2020/08/13/UAE-s-Jewish-community-reacts-to-country-s-historic-agreement-with-Israel.html", "site_name": "Al Arabiya English", "locale": "ar_AR", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://vid.alarabiya.net/images/2020/08/13/5d3bdd02-8308-41cc-8fd7-dd0a0326d05e/5d3bdd02-8308-41cc-8fd7-dd0a0326d05e_16x9_600x338.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@AlArabiya_Eng", "creator": "@AlArabiya_Eng", "title": "UAE\u2019s Jewish community reacts to country\u2019s historic agreement with Israel", "description": "Elli Kriel, founder of the first Jewish kosher eatery in the UAE, had just exchanged traditional"}}}}
