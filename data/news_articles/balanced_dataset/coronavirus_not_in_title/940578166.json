"TEXT": "The FBI will join Lebanese and other international investigators in the probe of the huge explosion at Beirut\u2019s port that killed more than 170 people, injured thousands and caused widespread destruction, a US diplomat has said.\n\nLebanese authorities invited the FBI to take part and it is one way Washington can help the country deal with the effects of the disaster, US undersecretary of state for political affairs David Hale said.\n\nHe spoke during a tour of the Gemayezeh neighbourhood, which was damaged by the August 4 blast.\n\nExpand Close Volunteers hold up

Lebanese politicians as they protest during David Hale\u2019s visit (Hussein Malla/AP)\n\n\u201cThe FBI will soon join Lebanese and international investigators at the invitation of the Lebanese in order to help answer questions that I know everyone has about the circumstances that led up to this explosion,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nIt is still not known what caused the fire responsible for igniting nearly 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate that were stored for years in Beirut\u2019s port.\n\nBut documents have emerged that show the country\u2019s top leadership and security officials were aware of the stockpile.\n\nFrench investigators are also taking part in the probe.\n\nThe US Embassy said Hale is expected to \u201creiterate the American government\u2019s commitment to assist the Lebanese people in recovering from the tragedy and rebuilding their lives\u201d.\n\nHe will also stress the \u201curgent need\u201d for embracing fundamental reforms by Lebanon\u2019s leaders.\n\nExpand Close Volunteers from the American University of Beirut walk next to destroyed buildings (Felipe Dana/AP) AP/PA Images / Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsapp Volunteers from the

Agency for International Development and the departments of State and Defence.\n\nThe US is one of the largest donors to the Lebanese armed forces.\n\nBut Washington views Hezbollah, a powerful political player in the government and Parliament, as a terrorist group.\n\nUS officials have expressed concerns about aid not going to the Hezbollah-backed government.\n\nThe government resigned on Monday, nearly a week after the blast that killed more than 170 people, injured at least 6,000 and wrecked the capital\u2019s port and caused widespread damage across the capital.\n\nThe Cabinet remains in a caretaker capacity.\n\nOn Thursday, Lebanon\u2019s Parliament approved a state of emergency in Beirut in its first session since the explosion, granting the military sweeping powers amid rising popular anger at official corruption and mismanagement and political uncertainty.\n\nThe disaster has raised popular fury towards Lebanon\u2019s leaders to a new level as the country reels from an unprecedented economic and financial crisis, along with the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBefore it resigned, the government declared the state of emergency that gave the military the power to declare curfews, prevent public gatherings and censor the media, as well as refer civilians to military tribunals for alleged security breaches.\n\nThe action required approval by politicians, which they granted on Thursday.\n\nThe move has been criticised by rights groups and others who say the civilian government already was operating with increased powers because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nSome pointed to the military crackdown on protesters last week, fearing the extended powers could lead to silencing dissent.\n\nPA Media", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,
