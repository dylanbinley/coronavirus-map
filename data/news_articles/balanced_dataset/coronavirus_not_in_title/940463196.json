Babagana Monguno (retd.), to coordinate the erection of safe storage facilities for explosives to prevent the type of explosion that happened recently in Lebanon.\n\nThe FEC meeting, which was presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, also directed the NSA to curb insecurity around mining areas across the country, especially in the Northwest.\n\nThese were among the approvals in a memorandum presented to the FEC by the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite.\n\nInformation and Culture Minister Lai Mohammed broke the news to State House correspondents after the 11th virtual FEC in Abuja.\n\nMohammed said the FEC approved the request that the NSA should set up secure storage facilities for explosives, saying the need for these became imperative, following the disaster that recently tore through Beirut, the Lebanese capital, where scores of the residents were killed, thousands rendered homeless and wreckage in billions of dollar left behind.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Mines and Steel Development presented a memo today (Wednesday), which largely was to ask for the council\u2019s approval in addressing the major challenges the mining industry is facing. These include insecurity in certain parts of the country, notably the Northwest where mining activities have been suspended due to the activities of bandits and kidnappers.\n\n\u201cThe industry is also faced with the problem of collusion between some major stakeholders, sometimes traditional rulers. The minister also said the problem of double taxation is actually driving a lot of investors out of the country.\n\n\u201cHe explained that certain decisions of past governments, especially in the area of storage of explosives used for mining, where, before now, the position was that any miner that wants to use explosives for mining must store same in either a military or police barracks. So, he requested that special facilities be built for the storage of such explosives.\n\n\u201cThe minister got the approval of council that the NSA should coordinate the issue of insecurity and illegal mining; the NSA should also coordinate the erection of safe storage facilities for explosives, also known as magazines, so that we don\u2019t have the kind of incident that happened in Lebanon.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "The Federal Executive Council (FEC) on Wednesday urged the National Security Adviser (NSA), Maj.-Gen.
