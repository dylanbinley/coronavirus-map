The funding would go to buy and move large quantities of perishables deemed surplus as the pandemic shut down much of the restaurant and hospitality industries in Canada and the U.S.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe program was opened up for applications from interested non-government organizations from mid-June through mid-July and Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau announced the eight successful applicants Thursday at an event at St-Hyacinthe, Que.\n\nThe eight partnerships, which in all involve over 100 different organizations, are expected to address \u201curgent, high-volume, highly perishable\u201d surplus.\n\nThe funding provided under the program is expected to ensure producers and processors are \u201cfairly compensated\u201d for their work at the cost of production, while also helping to develop relationships with community food providers and support efforts to reduce food waste, the government said.\n\nIn all, the chosen program partners are expected to redistribute about 12 million kilograms of surplus food to \u201cmore food-insecure\u201d families \u2014 food the government said \u201cwould otherwise have been wasted.\u201d\n\nThe chosen organizations are to leverage \u201cexisting food redistribution and recovery networks and agencies,\u201d among them \u201cleading not-for-profits,\u201d which will redistribute products including, among others, potatoes, chicken, turkey, eggs, fruit, vegetables, fish and other seafood.\n\nThe program\u2019s $50 million budget will break down as follows:\n\nCanadian Produce Marketing Association and charitable agencies, $11,429,926\n\nADVERTISEMENT Food Banks Canada, $11,358,529\n\nSecond Harvest, $11,007,095\n\nFisher River Cree Nation, $10,845,048\n\nLa Tablee des Chefs, $1,522,900\n\nClearwater Seafood and Indigenous communities, $1,491,072\n\nLes Fermes Dani, $1,430,000, and\n\nGreen Seafoods Ltd. and Feed Nova Scotia, $55,230.\n\nThe program \u201cleverages the deep supply chain expertise and knowledge the food banking network has, thereby helping those in Canada experiencing food insecurity in the most efficient manner,\u201d Food Banks Canada CEO Chris Hatch said in the government\u2019s release Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful for the opportunity to build deeper partnerships within the agri-food system as well as helping ensure that highly nutritious, available food feeds people in need and that these resources are stewarded responsibly.\u201d\n\nFor its project, Food Banks Canada plans to rescue \u201cmultiple\u201d surplus commodities and flow those foods in both \u201ccurrent and processed formats\u201d to its network of over 3,000 local-level food banks and community agencies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe CPMA\u2019s project will work similarly, moving produce to participating charitable agencies through participating distribution and transport companies.\n\nSecond Harvest\u2019s project will work in much the same way, but will use its FoodRescue.ca online platform and mobile app to determine \u201cwhen and from where\u201d specific surplus foods are acquired, and to make sure the rate of distribution \u201cdoes not exceed the handling and storage capacity of individual food charities.\u201d\n\nQuebec-based La Tablee des Chefs plans to recover over 350,000 kg of surplus foods, to be turned into meals by its network of chefs in Les Cuisines Solidaires in Quebec and in five Canadian cities: Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, Vancouver and Winnipeg. Meals are then to be redistributed through Banques Alimentaires du Quebec, Second Harvest and other organizations.\n\nFisher River Cree Nation, in Manitoba\u2019s Interlake region, expects to secure up to 2.9 million pounds of walleye caught in Canada\u2019s inland lakes, for distribution to over 75 Indigenous communities in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Canada\u2019s North.\n\nFor that project, distribution will be handled by way of the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corp., the Winnipeg-based marketing agency for commercial fishers in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories.\n\nThe Clearwater project will see 150,000 pounds of surplus seafood distributed to Indigenous communities in Nova Scotia and nationally, while the Green Seafoods project will see 24,000 pounds of frozen blue mussels bought and distributed through Feed Nova Scotia. Les Fermes Dani will distribute surplus potatoes to Indigenous communities in New Brunswick and nationally.\n\n\u201cNot only are we helping producers who cannot sell their goods to restaurants, but we are also aiding Canadians that have had to seek help from food banks,\u201d Bibeau said during Thursday\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cThese eight impressive partnerships between food businesses and not-for-profit organizations target those food commodities that had significant and urgent surpluses, making a difference both at the level of the producer and the food bank, from coast to coast to coast.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy working across sectors to build partnerships, we\u2019re creating a mutually beneficial system that meets two urgent needs at once,\u201d federal Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan said in the same release.\n\nBibeau\u2019s event Thursday was held at the St-Hyacinthe head office of Nutri Group, an egg marketing agency which with partners across Canada pledged over one million dozen fresh shell eggs to the Food Banks Canada and Second Harvest projects. \u2014 Glacier FarmMedia Network", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "noindex, follow", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Feds line up projects for surplus food program | Manitoba Co-operator", "description": "The federal government has lined up eight projects to source and distribute perishable produce, meat, eggs and seafood piling up across Canada due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
