After travelling to Japan in March to attend her son's wedding, Cook has been stranded in Japan for five months -- four months longer than expected -- because of COVID-19 travel limitations. She is hoping to fly back to Maine on Aug. 17.\n\nShe planned to spend a month in Japan. Five months later, she still hasn\u2019t made it back to Maine.\n\nOn March 10, when Maine resident and motel owner Linda York Cook traveled to Japan to attend her son\u2019s wedding, she thought she would be back home by mid-April. But that was before the global COVID-19 pandemic brought international air and marine traffic to a near standstill, leaving many travelers stranded while trying to find alternate ways to get home.\n\nOn March 10, when Maine resident and motel owner Linda York Cook traveled to Japan to attend her son\u2019s wedding, she thought she would be back home by mid-April.\n\nBut that was before the global COVID-19 pandemic brought international air and marine traffic to a near standstill, leaving many travelers stranded while trying to find alternate ways to get home. Now, more than five months later \u2014 and after multiple flight cancellations, medical complications from her diabetes, and countless conversations about logistics with her husband, who in her absence has been managing their Guilford motel by himself \u2014 Cook may finally be coming home.\n\nIf all goes well, she says, she will fly back to Bangor via Washington, D.C., on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe Japanese government extended my visa to September 8th but said they would not extend it again,\u201d Cook, 56, said when contacted online about her situation. \u201cMy husband has spent hours upon hours trying to get me a flight out. The [United States] embassy has been contacted and they said it wasn\u2019t their problem. So they have been no help.\u201d\n\nCook is not the only Mainer whose travel plans have been significantly disrupted by the pandemic. But in a year when unexpected COVID-19 interruptions and upheavals have affected nearly every person on the planet, Cook stands out for having a planned one-month trip last five times longer than expected.\n\nCook\u2019s husband, Larry Moon, said it has been a challenge running the Covered Bridge Motel in Guilford without his wife there. He has had to learn how to handle online bookings at the Route 6 motel, which overlooks Lowes Covered Bridge over the Piscataquis River, and to make the business\u2019 periodic tax payments, which Cook usually takes care of. Business has been slow this summer because of the pandemic, he said \u2014 he has lost some customers due to Maine\u2019s restrictions on out-of-state visitors \u2014 yet it has been a major adjustment to cater to pandemic precautions and to manage the business on his own.\n\nBut the biggest challenge, he said, has been trying to get his wife booked on a flight home from Kagoshima, Japan, where she has been staying with her son Joshua Cook, 33, an English teacher, and his new wife.\n\n\u201cI probably have spent days on the phone trying to get this handled,\u201d Moon said. \u201cIt\u2019s been five months now. It\u2019s been quite the situation.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. State Department did not comment on Cook\u2019s situation but said the department \u201chas no greater priority\u201d than the safety of U.S. citizens overseas and that it continues to work to help Americans get home. The department does not have figures or estimates for how many Americans might still be stranded in other countries because of pandemic-related travel limitations, she said. But between late January and early June, in response to the pandemic, the State Department helped more than 100,000 U.S. citizens return home from 136 countries and territories, according to information posted on the department\u2019s website.\n\nBlue Hill residents Tom Bjorkman and Roxanne Donahey were stranded in Sweden after flying there in February to visit their adult daughter, a professor at University of Gothenburg. They flew to Sweden on Feb. 26 and, after a couple of their flights home got canceled, were able to return on July 9 \u2014 more than two months later than they had originally planned.\n\n\u201cWe usually go twice a year for a couple of months,\u201d said Bjorkman, a semi-retired consultant who said that they stay with their daughter and son-in-law when they visit. They were able to help care for their grandson, who is almost 2, while they were there and had ample opportunity to get out for socially distanced exercise during their stay.\n\nBjorkman, 75, said he and Donahey, 76, are fairly healthy and were lucky they could extend their stay without complicating their lives back home in Blue Hill. He said they are hoping to return to Sweden in November.\n\n\u201cFor us, it would be frustrating and an inconvenience [to get stuck again],\u201d he said, \u201cbut it would not be a major crisis for us. We have flexibility a lot of people don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nFor Cook and Moon, aside from having to keep the 10-room motel running in Cook\u2019s absence, one of the complications has been her medical conditions. She has not contracted COVID-19, but only took with her a two-month supply of her regular medications, which she takes for her heart, kidneys and pain relief. Moon has since sent medicine through the mail \u2014 he could not send a new inhaler for her asthma because the canister is considered hazardous \u2014 but the medications were held up in customs, she said. She got them after some delay but still slipped into a diabetic coma in mid-July, and had to be taken to the local hospital in Kagoshima.\n\n\u201cThey got me out of it and I am really thankful but just need to get home to where my medical team is ready to treat me and see what damage has been done,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou never hear about stories like this, only about all the chaos in the world. I am thankful that I am here with my son and daughter in law but need to get home.\u201d\n\nMoon, who is 64 and also diabetic, said the stress of having his wife gone so long has affected his health as well, though not as severely as hers. Still, he said he thinks they and their motel business will make it through the pandemic. He just hopes she doesn\u2019t run out of any of her medications before she arrives back in Maine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m limping along a little bit, but we\u2019re okay considering the circumstances,\u201d he said, adding that he and their dog Zeus are eager to have Cook come home. \u201cJust like Dorothy said: There\u2019s no place like home.\u201d", "METADATA": {"description": "On March 10, when Maine resident and motel owner Linda York Cook traveled to Japan to attend her son\u2019s wedding, she thought she would be back home by mid-April.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut that was before the global COVID-19 pandemic brought international air and marine traffic to a near standstill, leaving many travelers stranded while trying to find alternate ways to get home.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 1276435375760502}, "og": {"title": "She planned to spend a month in Japan.
