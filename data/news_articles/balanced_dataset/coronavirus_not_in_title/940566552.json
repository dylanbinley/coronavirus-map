Turkey counters that it\u2019s entitled to conduct research in the area. Greece placed its military on alert, and sent warships to the area off Turkey\u2019s southern coast.\n\nIn Ankara, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated a call for dialogue.\n\n\u201cThe path for a solution in the eastern Mediterranean is dialogue and negotiation,\u201d Erdogan said during an address to his ruling party's officials. \u201cA formula based on a win-win solution that protects the rights of all can be found if we act with common sense and reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreece's attitude in the Aegean and the Mediterranean is malicious,\u201d Erdogan said, adding that the Greek island on which Athens bases its continental shelf claim is located just 2 kilometers (1.25 miles) from the Turkish coast and 580 kilometers (369 kilometers) from the Greek mainland.\n\nErdogan said: \u201cWe don't have designs on anyone's rights, but we won't let any country take away our rights.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish leader also accused France of \u201cprovoking\u201d Greece and Cyprus into taking \u201cwrongful steps.\u201d\n\nErdogan later held a telephone conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has previously interceded to ease similar tensions between Turkey and Greece. A statement from Erdogan's office said the Turkish leader voiced support for a resolution based on \u201cequity and dialogue within the framework of international law.\u201d\n\nThe Greek Defense Ministry said the French frigate Lafayette and the helicopter carrier Tonnerre held joint exercises with four Greek frigates Thursday in the eastern Mediterranean, including in areas Turkey is exploring. Two French Rafale fighter jets are making a stop Thursday at Souda, on Crete, after being previously deployed in Cyprus for an exercise.\n\nThe French Defense Ministry said France's military presence \u201cis aiming at reinforcing France\u2019s autonomous assessment of the situation and affirms the country\u2019s attachment to free movement, maritime safety and respect for international law in the Mediterranean Sea.\u201d\n\nMacron announced following a phone call with Mitsotakis late Wednesday that he decided to \u201ctemporarily reinforce the French military presence in the eastern Mediterranean in the coming days, in cooperation with European partners including Greece.\u201d\n\nGreece\u2019s NATO and European Union ally France is the EU\u2019s biggest military power. Complicating matters, Turkey \u2014 Greece\u2019s historic regional rival \u2014 is also a NATO member but has poor relations with France.\n\nIn a televised statement Wednesday, Mitsotakis warned of the \u201crisk of an accident\u201d in the area where the Greek and Turkish warships are gathered.\n\n\u201cIn such a case, responsibility lies upon the one who gives rise to these circumstances,\u201d he said. He added that Greece was not averse to \u201ceven the toughest dialogue,\u201d but that \u201cdialogue becomes irrelevant in a climate of tension and provocation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will never be the ones to escalate the situation. Yet, self-restraint is only one aspect of our power,\u201d Mitsotakis said. \u201cNo provocation will ... go unanswered.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias traveled to Israel for talks on the matter, as well as on a project between Israel, Greece and Cyrus to transport Israeli gas from offshore reserves through an undersea pipeline to Italy.\n\nDendias said that during meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign MInister Gabi Ashkenazi, he thanked them for Israel's support and \u201cmade it clear that Turkey's illicit behavior poses a threat to all countries in our region - a threat to security and stability.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu said Greece and Israel enjoy shared interests.\n\n\u201cObviously, we view gravely any aggression by anyone, including Turkey, in the eastern Mediterranean,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\nDendias is also due to meet U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Vienna on Friday, as well as Austria's foreign minister.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu held calls with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell as well as the foreign ministers of Bulgaria, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Hungary and Lithuania ahead of an emergency meeting of the EU\u2019s Foreign Affairs Council to discuss the situation in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nCyprus Foreign Minister Nikos Christoulides tweeted Thursday that Israel's Ashkenazi communicated with him to \u201creiterate Israel\u2019s support and solidarity in the face of escalating aggression in Cyprus\u2019 maritime zones.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFraser reported from Ankara.
