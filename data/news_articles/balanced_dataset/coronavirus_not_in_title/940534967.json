C.J. Stantz.\n\nStantz said the person who fired the shots left the scene by the time sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived. And sheriff\u2019s detectives are pursuing leads and still trying to determine what happened and have yet to make an arrest in the case.\n\nStantz, who declined to release further details about the shooting, said the skills-game establishment, which was not permitted to operate, has closed.\n\nSheriff\u2019s deputies arrested a 32-year-old Canton woman around 1:30 a.m. Thursday while they were carrying out their investigation at a nearby gas station on Waynesburg Drive SE. She was there to pick up someone, Stantz said. But so far, deputies have not found any indication she\u2019s linked to the shooting.\n\nThe woman, whom the deputies encountered during their investigation, Stantz said, was arrested because she was wanted on nine felony warrants, including charges of drug possession, drug possession and drug tampering.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office is asking anyone who knows what may have happened to call 330-430-3800 or the anonymous tip line at 330-451-3937.\n\nReach Repository writer Robert Wang at (330) 580-8327 or robert.wang@cantonrep.com.
