The staff member can alert police and speak to the customer.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Aberdeen woman almost scammed out of \u00a310,000 by fraudulent relationship scheme - Evening Express", "description": "An Aberdeen woman was almost scammed out of \u00a310,000 by a fraudulent relationship scheme.", "url": "https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/fp/news/local/aberdeen-woman-almost-scammed-out-of-10000-by-fraudulent-relationship-scheme/", "site_name": "Evening Express", "image": {"identifier": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/scam-846x564.jpg", "secure_url": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/scam-846x564.jpg", "width": 846, "height": 564}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/EveningExpressAberdeen", "tag": "trading standards", "section": "Local"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "premium-content": "false", "sailthru.date": "2020-08-14 15:11:21", "sailthru.title": "Aberdeen woman almost scammed out of \u00a310,000 by fraudulent relationship scheme", "sailthru.tags": "evening-express, Aberdeen, Crime, police, Scam, trading standards, News, Local", "sailthru.author": "David Walker", "sailthru.description": "An Aberdeen woman was almost scammed out of \u00a310,000 by a fraudulent relationship scheme.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/scam.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/scam-100x60.jpg", "sailthru.image.wp-thumbnail": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/scam-100x60.jpg", "sailthru.image.wp-medium": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/scam-270x180.jpg", "sailthru.image.wp-large": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/scam-846x564.jpg", "sailthru.image.wp-full": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/scam.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/04/cropped-ee-512x512-372x372.png"}}}
