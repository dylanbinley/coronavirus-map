REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nChina has stepped up its military activity near Taiwan, which it regards as a breakaway province.\n\nOn Monday, Taiwan said Chinese fighters briefly crossed the sensitive median line of the Taiwan Strait, the same day U.S. health chief Alex Azar met President Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei. China had denounced Azar\u2019s trip.\n\nTsai\u2019s Cabinet is proposing T$453.4 billion in military spending for the year starting in January, versus T$411.3 billion budgeted for this year, up 10.2% according to Reuters calculations.\n\n\u201cThe steady increase in the defence budget will facilitate the implementation of various military-building and war-preparation tasks ... and ensure national security and regional peace and stability,\u201d Taiwan\u2019s Defence Ministry said.\n\nAbout three hours after the budget announcement, China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s Eastern Theatre Command said its forces had in recent days carried out combat drills in the Taiwan Strait and to the north and south of the island, implying they were aimed at Azar\u2019s trip.\n\n\u201cRecently, a certain large country has continued to make negative moves on Taiwan-related issues, sending serious wrong signals to \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 forces, and seriously threatening the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThe theatre command\u2019s organising of patrols and exercises are necessary actions taken in response to the current security situation across the Taiwan Strait and to safeguard national sovereignty,\u201d the statement added.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Defence Ministry said the situation was normal and people should not worry.\n\nTsai has made modernising Taiwan\u2019s armed forces and increasing defence spending a priority.\n\nThe budget must be approved by lawmakers, though Tsai\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party has a large majority in the legislature, making it unlikely to be blocked.\n\nChina has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, and has denounced the United States for arms sales to the island. Washington is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.\n\nTaiwan is in discussions with the United States to acquire sea mines to deter amphibious landings, as well as cruise missiles for coastal defence, Taiwan\u2019s de facto ambassador to United States said on Wednesday.\n\nLast year, the U.S. State Department approved arms sales worth US$10 billion for Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s military is well-armed, but dwarfed by that of China.\n\n\u201cTaiwan authorities are spending their taxpayers\u2019 money on defence, but no matter how much they spend on defence, Taiwan is still a small place. Confronting the mainland is like an ant trying to shake a tree,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters in Beijing.", "METADATA": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "china", "DCSext.ChannelList": "aerospace-defence;china;worldNews;everythingNews;UK-The-Wire;UKWire_EL", "description": "Taiwan unveiled a T$42.1 billion ($1.4 billion) increase for next year's planned defence spending on Thursday, as China announced details of its latest combat drills near the democratic island.", "Author": "Yimou Lee", "keywords": "UK,TAIWAN,DEFENCE,Taiwan,Video,Asia / Pacific,Major News,Government Borrowing Requirement,Military Procurement,Pictures,Conflicts / War / Peace,Economic News (3rd Party),United States,Americas,Defense,Government Finances,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,China (PRC),Government / Politics,Aerospace / Defense (Legacy),General News,International / National Security,Emerging Market Countries,Aerospace and Defense (TRBC)", "news_keywords": "UK;TAIWAN;DEFENCE;Taiwan;Video;Asia / Pacific;Major News;Government Borrowing Requirement;Military Procurement;Pictures;Conflicts / War / Peace;Economic News (3rd Party);United States;Americas;Defense;Government Finances;Diplomacy / Foreign Policy;China (PRC);Government / Politics;Aerospace / Defense (Legacy);General News;International / National Security;Emerging Market Countries;Aerospace and Defense (TRBC)", "REVISION_DATE": "Thu Aug 13 09:14:25 UTC 2020", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2020-08-13T09:14:25+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Yimou Lee", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-taiwan-defence-idUKKCN2590BR", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Taiwan to raise defence spending as China details combat drills", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.K.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "UK,TAIWAN,DEFENCE,Taiwan,Video,Asia / Pacific,Major News,Government Borrowing Requirement,Military Procurement,Pictures,Conflicts / War / Peace,Economic News (3rd Party),United States,Americas,Defense,Government Finances,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,China (PRC),Government / Politics,Aerospace / Defense (Legacy),General News,International / National Security,Emerging Market Countries,Aerospace and Defense (TRBC)", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "UK-TAIWAN-DEFENCE", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Taiwan to raise defence spending as China details combat drills", "sailthru.author": "Yimou Lee", "sailthru.date": "2020-08-13T09:14:25+0000", "sailthru.title": "Taiwan to raise defence spending as China details combat drills", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "U.K.", "title": "Taiwan to raise defence spending as China details combat drills", "url": "https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-taiwan-defence-idUKKCN2590BR", "type": "article", "description": "Taiwan unveiled a T$42.1 billion ($1.4 billion) increase for next year's planned defence spending on Thursday, as China announced details of its latest combat drills near the democratic island.", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200813&t=2&i=1529437117&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7C06W", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T09:14:25+0000", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T09:14:25+0000", "section": "Subjects", "author": "Yimou Lee", "tag": "UK,TAIWAN,DEFENCE,Taiwan,Video,Asia / Pacific,Major News,Government Borrowing Requirement,Military Procurement,Pictures,Conflicts / War / Peace,Economic News (3rd Party),United States,Americas,Defense,Government Finances,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,China (PRC),Government / Politics,Aerospace / Defense (Legacy),General News,International / National Security,Emerging Market Countries,Aerospace and Defense (TRBC)"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ReutersUK"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ReutersUK", "creator": "@ReutersUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Taiwan to raise defence spending as China details combat drills", "description": "Taiwan unveiled a T$42.1 billion ($1.4 billion) increase for next year's planned defence spending on Thursday, as China announced details of its latest combat drills near the democratic island.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200813&t=2&i=1529437117&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7C06W", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200813&t=2&i=1529437117&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7C06W"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "uk.reuters/business/aerospace/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Home", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Subjects -
