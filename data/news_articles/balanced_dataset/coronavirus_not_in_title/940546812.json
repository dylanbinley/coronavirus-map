We can become crazy here. Please see some way to transfer us to a better place,\" a group of 13 men living in the hostel stated in a letter sent to Justice Minister Helen \u00adMcEntee and Minister for Children Roderic O'Gorman on July 10.\n\nThe Department of Justice said yesterday that \"restrictions on transfers were necessary as a precaution during the pandemic\".\n\n\"While transfers can now take place in limited circumstances, our ability to respond to transfer requests is contingent on public health advice and subject to availability within the accommodation system,\" it said.\n\nIt added that it does \"not disclose the centres to which residents are transferred in order to protect their privacy\", and does not intend to continue to use the hostel in Miltown Malbay.\n\nLast week, the department had said the Miltown Malbay premises was \"clean, safe and meeting the needs of residents\" in response to renewed appeals on behalf of the men.\n\nPaying tribute to Ms McEntee for her decision, the Miltown Malbay Welcome Group said it hoped this was \"just the first step\" in ensuring Ireland complies with its obligations under the Reception Conditions Regulations.\n\nIrish Independent", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover", "description": "The Department of Justice has confirmed that it is relocating asylum seekers from emergency accommodation in the west Clare town of Miltown Malbay.", "fb": {"pages": 96796398469, "app_id": 714861305308164}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=335158729, app-argument=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/asylum-seekers-to-be-moved-from-clare-hostel-39445595.html", "og": {"title": "Asylum seekers to be moved from Clare hostel", "site_name": "independent", "description": "The Department of Justice has confirmed that it is relocating asylum seekers from emergency accommodation in the west Clare town of Miltown Malbay.", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/asylum-seekers-to-be-moved-from-clare-hostel-39445595.html", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/0c63e/39445273.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/page24_mcentee.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/0c63e/39445273.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/page24_mcentee.jpg", "type": "image/png", "width": 1240, "height": 700}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Independent_ie", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/asylum-seekers-to-be-moved-from-clare-hostel-39445595.html", "title": "Asylum seekers to be moved from Clare hostel", "description": "The Department of Justice has confirmed that it is relocating asylum seekers from emergency accommodation in the west Clare town of Miltown Malbay.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/0c63e/39445273.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/page24_mcentee.jpg", "alt": "Plea: Men living at the hostel wrote to Minister Helen McEntee"}, "domain": "Independent.ie"}}}}
