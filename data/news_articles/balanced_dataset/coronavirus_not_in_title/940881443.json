A year later he was old enough and was off to war.\n\nOn Saturday a now-frail Mr Cook laid a wreath at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra in tribute to the near-million Australians who served in World War II, 39,000 of whom lost their lives.\n\n\u201cWhy did Les join up? He puts it simply: \u2018It was the thing to do \u2026 and you didn\u2019t give it a second thought\u2019,\u201d Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.\n\n\u201cThere was another reason too: \u2018To stop the bully\u2019.\n\n\u201cNo truer words have been spoken.\u201d\n\nTerri Lessels was meant to attend Saturday\u2019s event but was unwell and forced to stay home.\n\nShe was part of the Australian Army Medical Women\u2019s Service and helped nurse the victims of war.\n\nLance Cooke was a flight mechanic.\n\n\u201cHe checked every spark plug to keep our pilots and navigators safe. As he said \u2018they were my mates\u2019,\u201d Mr Morrison recounted.\n\nThe trio are among some 12,000 surviving Aussies who represented their country in World War II. About 39,000 Australians lost their lives.\n\n\u201cA country of seven million united and became one in a mighty national effort to defend human civilisation from the bullies who sought to destroy it,\u201d Mr Morrison said.\n\n\u201cEveryone played their part. Australia wasn\u2019t alone. We stood with allies and friends.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister highlighted the Dutch, New Zealand and the US.\n\n\u201cToday we call to mind all who stood with us \u2013 and who we stood with,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong those remembered was Teddy Sheean, a sailor in World War II, who was this week approved by the Queen to receive a posthumous Victoria Cross, Australia\u2019s highest military honour.\n\nThe teenage seaman died in 1942 when the HMAS Armidale was sunk by Japanese bombers in the Timor Sea.\n\nThe 18-year-old strapped himself to an anti-aircraft gun and fired at enemy planes as the ship went down.\n\nHe is credited with saving the lives of 49 crew.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "AustralianAssociatedPress", "url": "https://www.aap.com.au/political-leaders-mark-end-of-world-war-ii-2/", "title": "Aust marks WWII Victory in the Pacific", "description": "Australia's role in defeating the evils of Nazism has been remembered on the 75th anniversary of the ending of World War II in the Pacific.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/aap-nw-aap.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15130003/23e0b2aa-4755-4206-946f-6802c070d9a6.jpg?v=1597460404", "width": 500, "height": 500}, "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AAPNewswire", "url": "https://www.aap.com.au", "title": "Australian Associated Press", "description": "Trusted, accurate and impartial", "card": "summary"}}}}
