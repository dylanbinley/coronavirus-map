I have not given up on that.\u201d\n\nRight-wing figures in Israel see things differently.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu promised us time and again that he would apply Israeli sovereignty. That was his major campaign promise,\u201d David Elhayani, a top settler leader, told The Media Line.\n\n\u201cHe deceived us. He deceived hundreds of thousands of voters,\u201d Elhayani continued before turning his words directly to Netanyahu.\n\n\u201cMr. Prime Minister, you have betrayed our trust,\u201d he stated. \u201cDon\u2019t expect us to stay quiet. Our faith in you has expired.\u201d\n\nMr. Prime Minister, you have betrayed our trust. Don\u2019t expect us to stay quiet. Our faith in you has expired\n\nNaftali Bennett, head of the right-wing Yamina party and a member of the opposition in Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, called the deal a \u201cmissed opportunity of once in 100 years\u201d and bemoaned the \u201ctragic\u201d fact that Netanyahu \u201clacked the courage to seize the moment,\u201d referring to the annexation issue.\n\nIf signed, the landmark deal will make the UAE only the third nation in the Arab world to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel.\n\nIts ambassador to Washington hailed the deal.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a win for diplomacy and for the region. It is a significant advance in Arab-Israeli relations that lowers tensions and creates new energy for positive change,\u201d Yousef al-Otaiba said in a statement.\n\nTrump also promised that \u201cvery exciting things\u201d would soon happen in the region, \u201cincluding with the Palestinians.\u201d He suggested that more diplomatic breakthroughs were expected.\n\n\u201cThings are happening that I can\u2019t talk about,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn the West Bank city of Ramallah, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas merely called for an urgent meeting of officials to be followed by a statement.\n\nHamas, the ruler of the Gaza Strip, issued a statement affirming its \u201crejection\u201d of the agreement, calling it a \u201cdenial of the rights of the Palestinians.\u201d\n\nHanan Ashrawi, member of PLO Executive Committee, said in a tweet: \u201cIsrael got rewarded for not declaring openly what it\u2019s been doing to Palestine illegally & persistently since the beginning of the occupation. The UAE has come out in the open on its secret dealings/normalization with Israel. Please don\u2019t do us a favor.
