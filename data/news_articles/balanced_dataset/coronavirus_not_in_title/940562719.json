Harris is currently a US senator from California and the former attorney general for the state. Biden\u2019s choice brings her back to the fore of the 2020 race after having dropped out as a presidential candidate in early December.\n\nIn many ways, Harris dropped out because she had trouble setting herself apart from other candidates such as Biden, representing the mainstream of the Democratic Party. While Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders represented in many respects the far left of the Democratic coalition, Harris was just one of several establishment Democrats in the race, and competed for many of the same fundraising dollars as Biden and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nBy picking Harris, Biden\u2014or whoever is making these decisions for Biden\u2014will likely placate the Obama-Clinton power brokers in the party who privately oppose lawmakers like Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who are viewed by establishment Democrats as candidates who often alienate middle-class Middle American voters. At the same time, Harris is likely to satisfy\u2014or at least silence\u2014critics on the party\u2019s left wing, who have long called for a black woman on the presidential ticket.\n\nIn 2020, the choice of a vice-presidential candidate is especially high-stakes, because many believe Biden will be either unwilling or unable to run for president in 2024. This sets Harris up as the heir-apparent leader of the party. Because Biden will be the oldest man to ever enter the presidency, and because he is clearly not in excellent health, it is known that Harris has a good chance of succeeding him directly in case he dies or becomes seriously ill.\n\nBut although Harris is \u201cdemographically correct\u201d for the party\u2019s left wing, she remains basically a social climber who is very well ensconced in the mainstream of the party\u2014although the party\u2019s mainstream has itself moved considerably to the left in recent years.\n\nOn foreign policy, for instance, Harris is not significantly different from Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Susan Rice, Joseph Biden, or other high-ranking US officials who have been happy to perpetuate endless wars across the globe in recent decades. According to her official campaign site, no region of the globe is off-limits to US intervention so long as the US intervenes multilaterally. It\u2019s just the Clinton-Obama doctrine yet again. In usual Washington doublespeak fashion, she says she is in favor of ending the war in Afghanistan but insists that the US must maintain a presence there to prop up the Afghani regime. She has advocated continued military intervention in Syria.\n\nHarris is very much an advocate of the conspiracy theory that Russians \u201chacked\u201d the 2016 election and remain a major threat to US security.\n\nOn the environment, she supports a \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d which we would today expect from any Democrat running for the White House. This means immense amounts of new subsidies for \u201cgreen energy,\u201d paid for with new taxes and a host of new regulations on private businesses. It means global management of carbon emissions in line with international agreements like the Paris accords.\n\nOn economic policy, it\u2019s the usual interventionist slate of policies. She wants to \u201cempower\u201d labor unions, more heavily regulate employers, and aggressively prosecute businesses for a variety of \u201ccrimes\u201d that run afoul of the intricate labyrinth of federal laws managing the financial sector. Fiscal policy is sure to be what we\u2019ve come to expect from both Republicans and Democrats: endless deficit spending.\n\nHarris has lauded federally imposed mandates like \u201cforced busing,\u201d in which federal courts dictate public schools\u2019 enrollment policies in the name of racially desegregating schools.\n\nIn all of this, we don\u2019t find very much at all that differs from the eight years of the Obama administration. It\u2019s the usual center-left policy agenda we\u2019ve seen since at least the 2008 election.\n\nWhat is especially dangerous now, however, is that the political context has changed considerably. Both major US parties have adopted far more interventionist stances in terms of fiscal policy, monetary policy, and in terms of domestic police power. What\u2019s more, the presidency has slowly been moving toward a rule-by-decree model for decades, in which the president essentially rules through executive orders and Congress only intervenes on occasion. The Trump administration has only accelerated this trend.\n\nThis is likely music to Kamala Harris\u2019s ears. Harris, after all, as a former prosecutor and as a presidential candidate has never shied away from aggressive use of executive power.\n\nAs Tyler Curtis has noted:\n\nOver the course of her campaign, she has repeatedly promised to bypass Congress and take unilateral action on a whole host of intensely divisive issues. On immigration, she has vowed to issue an executive order granting citizenship to \u201cDreamers\u201d (migrants brought to America illegally by their parents). On the environment, she says she will declare a \u201cstate of water emergency\u201d and force the country to re-join the Paris Climate agreement. She also wants to ban the use of fracking. Many observers have noted how dictatorial these statements sound, and rightly so. To follow through on any one of these proposals would be deeply suspect, but the sheer number of them, coupled with Harris\u2019 brazenly peremptory attitude, must leave no doubt as to her authoritarian ambitions. For Harris, Congress is at best merely an advisory body. As a kindly gesture, the President may ask Congress for permission to do something, but he or she does not really require their assent.\n\nHarris has even said she would do an end run around Congress on gun control:\n\nupon being elected, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass gun safety laws. And if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action. And specifically what I\u2019ll do is put in place a requirement that for anyone who sells more than five guns a year, they are required to do background checks when they sell those guns.\n\nThese are the words of a politician who views the role of the president as an elected dictator. Many presidents, of course\u2014including Donald Trump\u2014have likely viewed things this way, but it\u2019s now easier than ever for a president to carry out these \u201cpromises\u201d in which presidents don\u2019t wait for Congress to pass duly enacted laws. That\u2019s the old way of doing things. The new way is to follow Barack Obama\u2019s strategy of using \u201ca pen and a phone\u201d to issue diktats without the inconvenience of involving an elected legislature.\n\nNo doubt, many of Harris\u2019s detractors will call her radical or a tool of the far left. The reality is actually far more alarming. Radicals have a tendency to lose political battles, because they often stand on principle. Harris is unlikely to have that problem. She is very much a savvy player who fits in well within the party\u2019s mainstream and who will carry on the center-left political program as we\u2019ve come to expect it from the likes of Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama. There\u2019s not much here that\u2019s new. What has changed, however, is that we live in a country where presidents are ever more rapidly becoming unrestrained in taking unilateral action to do what they want. In ages past it might have been reasonable to assume the Congress might effectively intervene to restrain a president\u2019s less popular and more radical proposals. That vision of the US regime is looking more unrealistic than ever.\n\nThis was originally published on Mises.org.", "METADATA": {"robots": "noodp,noydir", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "2020 ELECTION: Kamala Harris is Obama-Clinton 2.0 \u2013 only worse", "url": "http://economiccollapsenews.com/2020/08/13/2020-election-kamala-harris-is-obama-clinton-2-0-only-worse/", "description": "By: Ryan McMaken Presidential candidate and former vice president Joseph Biden announced Kamala Harris as his running mate today.
