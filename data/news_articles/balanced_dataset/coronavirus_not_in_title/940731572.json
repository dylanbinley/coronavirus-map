In a move backed by Estonia, Latvia, and Poland, Naus\u0117da proposed a three-point mediation plan. It was submitted on Thursday via \u201cdiplomatic channels\u201d to the Belarusian authorities, according to the president\u2019s adviser.\n\n\n\nRead more: \u2018We want action\u2019 Lithuania to propose EU sanctions against Belarus\u2019 officials\n\nIf the move to establish a national council uniting the opposition and Lukashenko\u2019s government fails, \u201cwe will probably start to look for other alternatives [including] sanctions\u201d, said Naus\u0117da.\n\nWhen asked about Russia\u2019s interests in Belarus, Naus\u0117da said Moscow is keen \"to have this satellite state and Belarus would be fully integrated into Russia, if it will stay passive and if they will be just watching this process.\u201d\n\nBelarus and Russia have been negotiating the terms of the Union Treaty originally signed in 1999. Lukashenko previously said the Kremlin has been pressuring the country to accept closer alignment.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo our interest, and not only for Lithuania, but also for the European Union, is a stable, democratic, and sovereign Belarus,\u201d said Naus\u0117da.\n\n\n\nMass protests have been shaking Belarus following the election on August 9, which saw Lukashenko secure his sixth term as president. Civil society and the opposition say the vote was rigged.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=200", "msapplication-config": "/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=200", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "ROBOTS": "INDEX", "description": "Lithuanian President Gitanas Naus\u0117da said in an interview with the British Sky News TV that Alexander Lukashenko is not the legitimate leader of Belarus.", "fb": {"app_id": 470743216272990, "pages": 128572499128}, "og": {"site_name": "lrt.lt", "locale": "lt_LT", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1210314/lithuanian-president-lukashenko-not-legitimate-leader-of-belarus", "title": "Lithuanian president: Lukashenko not legitimate leader of Belarus", "description": "Lithuanian President Gitanas Naus\u0117da said in an interview with the British Sky News TV that Alexander Lukashenko is not the legitimate leader of Belarus.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.lrt.lt/img/2020/08/12/702340-73812-1287x836.jpg", "width": 1287, "height": 836}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T08:18:00Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/lrtlt", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/lrtlt"}, "lrt_authors": "LRT.lt", "lrt_section": "News,naujienos", "lrt_type": "news_article"}}}
