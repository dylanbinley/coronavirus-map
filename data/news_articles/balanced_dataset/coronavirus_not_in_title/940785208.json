National Heritage Week takes place from August 15-23. Minister O\u2019Brien said he was looking forward to participating in local events both in person and virtually.\n\n\u201cDue to COVID-19 restrictions many of the events will be held virtually, with people encouraged to participate with \u2018heritage on your doorstep\u2019. I\u2019m fortunate to have many heritage sites in my area and will be visiting Swords Castle next week which has a rich 800-year history\" he said.\n\n\u201cOur heritage is hugely important, it plays a significant role in our lives, it connects us to the past and our ancestors, helps us define our roots and identity and anchors our history. In normal times it is the attraction for hundreds of thousands of visitors to our island each year contributing massively to our local economies.\n\n\u201cI would like to commend the Heritage Council and all the Local Authority Heritage Officers along with local heritage groups and organisations who have managed to create a fantastic programme of events despite the ongoing pandemic. I would encourage people to engage with the events online, to participate in the projects and where possible and safe to visit the heritage sites in their area.\"\n\nSee https://www.heritageweek.ie/.", "METADATA": {"description": "A number of events taking place", "Keywords": "Kilkenny,Heritage Week", "news_keywords": "Kilkenny,Heritage Week", "sections": "Home,News", "viewport": "width=1024,target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Minister O\u2019Brien encourages people to participate in Heritage Week", "description": "A number of events taking place", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_8672933.jpg--kilkenny__.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 315}, "url": "https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/home/566429/minister-obrien-encourages-people-to-participate-in-heritage-week.html"}, "fb": {"app_id": 166682180361179}, "twitter": {"title": "Minister O\u2019Brien encourages people to participate in Heritage Week", "description": "A number of events taking place", "url": "https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/home/566429/minister-obrien-encourages-people-to-participate-in-heritage-week.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_8672933.jpg--kilkenny__.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 315}}, "articleID": 566429, "datePublished": "2020-08-14T14:21:59Z", "google-signin-clientid": "60424671238-8p3viomkb07jcf31lvn5t53v1qrdhct1.apps.googleusercontent.com", "google-signin-scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.profile.emails.read", "google-signin-requestvisibleactions": "https://schema.org/AddAction", "google-signin-cookiepolicy": "single_host_origin"}}}
