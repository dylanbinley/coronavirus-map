It must be noted that the intended point of the envoy\u2019s intervention was not in sync with our political reality and the envoy was adequately briefed to this effect.\n\n\u201cThe coming of the envoy helped to correct propaganda by perennial conveners of the \u2018crisis-narrative\u2019 in Zimbabwe\u2019. The absence of the falsely postured political crisis in Zimbabwe is enough for the region through South-Africa to be guided accordingly about the current political stability in Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cTo us, the envoy is essential as it would adequately bring factual traction to our reality which has been distorted to compensate for the dismal failure of the 31 July organised protests.\u201d\n\nMpofu dismissed as characteristic falsehoods of the opposition that the envoys snubbed them or that the ruling party stopped the envoys from meeting them.\n\nFormer Liberation Movements (FLM), Dr Mpofu said, were aware of the threats posed by the neo-colonialist elements who wanted to push for regime change in the region using social media to cause despondency.\n\n\u201cWe are in regular contacts in the SADC and beyond,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn the SADC, we have a body of FLMs which attends to such matters. In as much as we need to set the record straight on this issue, our fellow liberation movements are aware of such neo-colonial projects across the continent.\n\n\u201cThe perennial threat of neo-colonial infiltration resides at the centre of what we should be grappling with. As it stands, the false alarms of the Zimbabwean crisis substantiate the urgency for FLMs to be resolute in confronting the antagonists of our liberation.\u201d\n\nZimbabwe has been under attack from the country\u2019s detractors who have been on a social media campaign, using doctored images and others from other countries to paint a picture of gloom and doom just to derail positive strides that are being made by the Second Republic in improving the economy. \u2013 Herald", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Zanu PF gloats over SA envoys' opposition snub - The Zimbabwe Mail", "description": "THE visit to Zimbabwe by three South African envoys helped [...]", "url": "https://www.thezimbabwemail.com/politics/zanu-pf-gloats-over-sa-envoys-opposition-snub/", "site_name": "The Zimbabwe Mail", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thezimbabwemail.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Obert-Mpofu.jpg", "width": 404, "height": 293}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T09:26:54+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TheZimbabweMail", "site": "@TheZimbabweMail"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.5", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.thezimbabwemail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cropped-Bird-270x270.png"}}}
