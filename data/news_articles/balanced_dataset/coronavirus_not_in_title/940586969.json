(Jeff J Mitchell/Getty)\n\nQueer activists staged a beautiful rainbow protest at the Polish consulate in Edinburgh to express their solidarity with LGBT+ Poles.\n\nEdinburgh is twinned with the Polish city of Krakow, which recently joined Poland\u2019s growing list of \u201cLGBT-free zones\u201d.\n\nThe two cities were joined in a civic partnership agreement in 1994, and cooperate in areas including culture, heritage, monument protection and education.\n\nAround 100 municipalities in Poland have so far declared themselves to be \u201cLGBT-free zones\u201d after signing a pledge opposing any tolerance or acceptance of the LGBT+ community.\n\nPoland\u2019s recently re-elected homophobic president Andrzej Duda has continuously attacked the country\u2019s LGBT+ community, vowing to ban same-sex marriage, gay adoption and LGBT-inclusive education in schools, and queer people across the country are living in fear.\n\nLast week, Polish police detained 48 protestors as they tried to block the arrest of LGBT+ rights activist Margot, who was accused of draping LGBT+ Pride flags over statues in Warsaw as well as damaging a Pro-Right to Life Foundation campaigner\u2019s car.\n\nOn Monday, 10 August and Thursday, 13 August, queer activists and members of the Scottish Polish community gathered outside the Polish consulate in Edinburgh to protest against government-approved attacks on the LGBT+ community.\n\nOrganisers of the protest wrote on Facebook: \u201cSTOP REPRESSIONS against LGBT+ community in Poland!\n\n\u201cSolidarity with Margot and other arrested activists.\n\n\u201cThe Polish government attacks members of the LGBT+ community, openly promotes homophobia and transphobia, encourages violence against LGBT+ people and itself uses unlawful and brutal violence, ordering police to target activists.\u201d\n\nThe kaleidoscopic protest saw participants wearing rainbow masks, carrying Pride flags, and holding signs which read: \u201cLet my people love.\u201d\n\nLast week, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, Frank Ross, wrote to Krakow\u2019s mayor Jacek Majchrowski asking him to clarify the Polish city\u2019s opposition to homophobia and LGBT+ oppression.\n\nMajchrowski has publicly denounced homophobia and in July this year shared an open letter in support of the LGBT+ citizens of Krakow.\n\nBut Lord Ross urged Majchrowski to explicitly confirm that he still supports the shared principles on which the cities\u2019 twinning relationship was founded.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "description": "Queer activists staged a rainbow protest at the Polish consulate in Edinburgh to express their solidarity with LGBT+ Poles.", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Activists stage beautiful kaleidoscopic protest at Polish consulate with rainbows, pride and solidarity", "description": "Queer activists staged a rainbow protest at the Polish consulate in Edinburgh to express their solidarity with LGBT+ Poles.", "url": "https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/08/13/edinburgh-protest-polish-consulate-queer-activist-poland-pride-scottish-krakow/", "site_name": "PinkNews -
