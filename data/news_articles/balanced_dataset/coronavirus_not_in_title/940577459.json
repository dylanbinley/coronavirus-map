Israel was not ready to accept the return of all of those who were resettled.\n\nDespite a $33m budget, only 30 Palestinians ended up moving and the programme was scrapped after the killing of an Israeli embassy worker by two Palestinians who had moved to Paraguay as part of the programme in 1970.\n\nAll the territories captured by the Israelis in 1967 remain under their effective control. With the exception of Gaza, which has been besieged by Israel since 2007, all host considerable Israeli settlements.\n\nThe founding of Israel led to the permanent expulsion of more than 700,000 Palestinians from land that is now recognised as Israel proper.\n\nThose expelled and their descendants now number around 7.2 million people, the majority of whom live as refugees in the occupied Palestinian territories, Lebanon, Jordan, and other states.\n\nThis article has been adapted from its original source.", "METADATA": {"title": "Israel Planned to Transfer 60,000 Palestinians to Paraguay in The 1960s | Al Bawaba", "og": {"site_name": "Al Bawaba", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.albawaba.com/news/israel-planned-transfer-60000-palestinians-paraguay-1960s-1374344", "title": "Israel Planned to Transfer 60,000 Palestinians to Paraguay in The 1960s | Al Bawaba", "description": "The Latin American state had agreed to \u2018absorb\u2019 60,000 Palestinian Muslims as a counterweight to Communists.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/default/public/2020-08/old%20city%201930s%20afp.jpg?itok=WbyIYFHb", "url": "https://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/default/public/2020-08/old%20city%201930s%20afp.jpg?itok=WbyIYFHb", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The Latin American state had agreed to \u2018absorb\u2019 60,000 Palestinian Muslims as a counterweight to Communists.", "title": "Israel Planned to Transfer 60,000 Palestinians to Paraguay in The 1960s | Al Bawaba", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/default/public/2020-08/old%20city%201930s%20afp.jpg?itok=WbyIYFHb", "height": 630, "width": 1200}}, "description": "The Latin American state had agreed to \u2018absorb\u2019 60,000 Palestinian Muslims as a counterweight to Communists.", "abstract": "The Latin American state had agreed to \u2018absorb\u2019 60,000 Palestinian Muslims as a counterweight to Communists.", "keywords": "West Bank, palestinian, Israel, Paraguay", "referrer": "origin", "rights": "\u00a92020 Al Bawaba.
