The ban will remain in force for 10 years, the ministry said.\n\nForeign Minister Linas Linkevicius thanked Lithuanian and Israeli national security agencies for information that led to the decision.\n\nThe European Union, of which Lithuania is a member, considers only Hezbollah\u2019s military wing to be a terrorist group. Hezbollah officials have said the distinction is false and that all the organs of the movement operate in unison.\n\nAccording to multiple diplomatic sources, the distinction was made at the insistence of France, which has resisted a comprehensive ban on the group because it believes that would harm the EU\u2019s relationship with Lebanon, where Hezbollah is a major political force.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The ban will be in place for 10 years.", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Lithuania Bans Hezbollah-Affiliated Persons From Entering Its Territory", "description": "The ban will be in place for 10 years.", "url": "https://jewishjournal.com/news/worldwide/320330/lithuania-bans-hezbollah-affiliated-persons-from-entering-its-territory/", "site_name": "Jewish Journal", "image": {"identifier": "https://jewishjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-188004018.jpg", "width": 3000, "height": 2000}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/JewishJournal/", "published_time": "2020-08-14T15:55:59+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 147207306627016}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JewishJournal", "site": "@JewishJournal"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://jewishjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-jjlogo6214_512-270x270.png"}}}
