Its population of two million currently receives around six hours of electricity followed by a 10 hour power cut.\n\nOvernight, Israel said its warplanes and tanks struck Hamas facilities in response to the balloons. Israel had earlier shut down Gaza's main commercial crossing and reduced the area where it permits Palestinians to fish.\n\nIn Gaza City, a school run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) was damaged by one of the strikes, Gaza's interior ministry said.\n\nThe school was empty at the time and there were no reports of casualties. \"Apparently the device did not explode,\" an UNRWA statement said.\n\nThe Israeli military said that during its strikes on Hamas military targets, some of which it said were deliberately placed in heavily populated areas, a school building was accidentally damaged. The incident was being looked into, the military said.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought three wars since 2008 and have traded blows in the past few years. Citing security concerns, Israel keeps tight control of its border crossings with Gaza and imposes a naval blockade.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Additional reporting by Maayan Lubell in Jerusalem; Editing by Robert Birsel, Gareth Jones and Daniel Wallis)", "METADATA": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooIndia", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Israel said on Thursday it would stop shipments of fuel into Gaza in response to Palestinians in the enclave launching incendiary balloons that have torched tracts of farmland on the Israeli frontier.
