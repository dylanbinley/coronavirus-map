We stood with our allies and our friends, this was a global fight. All understood that if tyranny was not confronted together, eventually it would be confronted alone. True then, true today.\"\n\nThe Aug. 15 Victory in the Pacific Day commemorates Japan's acceptance of the Allies' demand to surrender, three months after Nazi Germany surrendered in Europe.\n\nAlmost one million Australians served in World War Two. Some 39,000 died and another 30,000 were taken prisoner, according to government data.
