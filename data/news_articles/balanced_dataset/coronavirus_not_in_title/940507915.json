Joseph Klein\n\nhttps://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/2020/08/trump-confronts-chinese-regimes-technological-joseph-klein/\n\nThe Chinese communist empire has weaponized social media, telecommunications and cloud computing to expand the reach of its infiltration and surveillance capabilities way beyond its borders. Americans\u2019 personal data and intellectual property are prime targets for the regime\u2019s malign activities, which have gone on for decades without any blowbacks of consequence. In fact, globalists have encouraged the integration of China into the world economy, falling prey to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu\u2019s stratagem that \u201cAll warfare is based on deception.\u201d But the time has finally arrived for China to pay the piper, thanks to President Trump.\n\nThe Trump administration is seeking to quarantine Chinese-owned apps and China\u2019s digital infrastructure under its \u201cClean Network\u201d program, announced by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on August 5th.\n\n\u201cThe Clean Network program is the Trump Administration\u2019s comprehensive approach to guarding our citizens\u2019 privacy and our companies\u2019 most sensitive information from aggressive intrusions by malign actors, such as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),\u201d Secretary Pompeo said in his press statement. This represents a sharp ramp-up of the technology cold war between the United States and the communist regime.\n\nThe Clean Networks program includes the removal of \u201cuntrusted\u201d Chinese-owned apps from U.S. mobile app stores like those run by Apple and Google. The Trump administration has previously targeted China\u2019s ByteDance-owned TikTok\u2019s United States operations, which the administration wants to either eliminate or require their complete sale (including the transfer of all relevant software code) to a U.S. company such as Microsoft.\n\nThe Clean Network program would prevent U.S. applications from being preinstalled or made available for download on mobile devices manufactured by \u201cuntrusted\u201d Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei. \u201cHuawei, an arm of the PRC surveillance state, is trading on the innovations and reputations of leading U.S. and foreign companies,\u201d Secretary Pompeo\u2019s press statement indicated.\n\nThe Clean Network program is also aimed at Chinese cloud computing platforms. It seeks, according Secretary Pompeo\u2019s press statement, to \u201cprevent U.S. citizens\u2019 most sensitive personal information and our businesses\u2019 most valuable intellectual property, including COVID-19 vaccine research, from being stored and processed on cloud-based systems accessible to our foreign adversaries through companies such as Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent.\u201d\n\nFinally, the Trump administration wants to block certain undersea cables from linking China to the United States in order to \u201censure the undersea cables connecting our country to the global internet are not subverted for intelligence gathering by the PRC at hyper scale.\u201d\n\nThe United States is not doing this alone. \u201cMore than thirty countries and territories are now Clean Countries,\u201d according to Secretary Pompeo\u2019s press statement, \u201cand many of the world\u2019s biggest telecommunications companies are Clean Telcos. All have committed to exclusively using trusted vendors in their Clean Networks.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump followed up Secretary Pompeo\u2019s announcement with executive orders addressing the threats posed by TikTok and WeChat, currently owned by Chinese companies ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. respectively. The orders ban U.S. transactions with TikTok owner ByteDance and Tencent\u2019s WeChat.\n\nIf the Chinese government wants to continue spying on its own residents inside of China, so be it. We are not the world\u2019s human rights policeman. But the United States cannot continue to allow China\u2019s weaponizing of technology it owns to intrude into American governmental institutions and into the lives and businesses of the American people.\n\nThe president\u2019s executive orders certainly got the Chinese regime\u2019s attention. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry on August 7th called them \u201cblatant hegemonic acts.\u201d Leftist apologists for China in this country recite the same Chinese talking points. Columbia University\u2019s left wing economist professor Jeffrey Sachs, for example, denies that the Chinese regime has any global hegemonic ambitions. His proof is China\u2019s own self-serving defense white paper, from which he quotes the following in his recent article entitled America\u2019s Unholy Crusade Against China: \u201cChina will never follow the beaten track of big powers in seeking hegemony.\u201d\n\nCoddlers of the Chinese regime are burying their heads in the sand. China\u2019s President Xi Jinping, whose tenure in office may last the rest of his life, said several years ago that the Chinese people must concentrate their efforts on \u201cbuilding a socialism that is superior to capitalism, and laying the foundation for a future where we will win the initiative and have the dominant position.\u201d\n\nChina has played successive U.S. administrations since its professed opening of its economy to global trade and investments. It wants to replace the current rules-based international system with one dominated by China\u2019s authoritarian model. To that end, the regime is deftly exploiting multilateral institutions from the World Trade Organization to the World Health Organization to the United Nations itself.\n\nThus, China has managed to get away with retaining a \u201cdeveloping country\u201d status within the World Trade Organization, which gives it unfair preferences. China has the second largest Gross Domestic Product in the world, following only the United States. It does not deserve any preferential treatment. But it still gets them. China used the World Health Organization to repeat its lies about the coronavirus pandemic, which started in China. If the World Health Organization had been more independent of Chinese influence and questioned China\u2019s knowingly false claim that there was no human-to-human transmission of the virus at a time when the virus could have been more easily contained, hundreds of thousands of lives could have been saved. And the UN Secretary General\u2019s office has been reduced to responding with a \u201cno comment\u201d when I asked about the number of pro-democracy candidates for the Hong Kong legislative election who were declared ineligible and the subsequent postponement of the election itself for at least a year. These developments followed the Chinese regime\u2019s imposition of its new security law clamping down on the remaining freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. Such draconian measures deserve more from the United Nations, which is unsparing in its criticisms of Israel, than a \u201cno comment.\u201d\n\nWorking from within such submissive globalist organizations, the Chinese regime\u2019s aim is \u201cto promote its own worldview and concepts while sidelining the existing governance norms and values,\u201d the National Bureau of Asian Research noted in its comprehensive January 2020 report entitled China\u2019s Vision for a New World Order. The regime wants to purge as much of the world as it can of the Enlightenment principles of democracy, pluralism, and individual human rights. In their place, China\u2019s communist dictatorship heralds its authoritarian \u2018L\u2019\u00e9tat, c\u2019est moi\u2019 rule as the superior governance model for the world.\n\nPresident Trump grasps what is at stake and has taken strong actions to push back at the Chinese regime for its belligerent acts. Joe Biden, on the other hand, wants to go back to the days of na\u00efve U.S. policies.\n\nComments are closed.", "METADATA": {"generator": "WordPress 5.5"}}}
