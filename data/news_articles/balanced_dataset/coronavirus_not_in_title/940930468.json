He referred to the damage inflicted on Japan and its people, but did not mention the suffering of Japan's neighbors.\n\nFewer than 600 people were at the event \u2014 which was scaled back due to the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 compared to the 6,000 who attended last year. Masks were mandatory, and there was no singing of the national anthem.\n\nRead more: Japan marks 75th anniversary of end of World War II\n\nStriking a more apologetic tone than Abe, Emperor Naruhito told the crowd he felt deep regret over his country's military actions, including its invasion of China and South Korea.\n\n\"Reflecting on our past and bearing in mind the feelings of deep remorse, I earnestly hope that the ravages of war will never be repeated,\" said 60-year-old Naruhito, who has sought to make amends for the period of military aggression overseen by his grandfather, Hirohito.\n\nSocial distancing and masks were mandatory at the scaled-back memorial ceremony\n\nMinisters visit controversial Yasukuni Shrine\n\nSince entering office in 2012, Abe has steered clear of acknowledging Japan's wartime hostilities in his August 15 speeches, instead saying future generations should not be held responsible for past mistakes.\n\nOn Saturday, he sent a ritual offering to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine for war dead but did not visit the site in person. The highly controversial shrine honors 2.46 million war dead, as well as 14 Japanese military leaders who were convicted as war criminals by an Allied tribunal. For that reason, China and South Korea see Yasukuni as a symbol of past Japanese aggression. Abe's last visit there, in December 2013, sparked an international outcry.\n\nWhile Abe stayed away, at least four of his Cabinet ministers paid their respects \u2014 the first ministerial visit in four years.\n\nRead more: Japan summons South Korean ambassador over WWII labor row\n\nWatch video 07:49 Share How one girl shaped our understanding of Hiroshima Send Facebook google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3gSut How one girl's story shaped the world's understanding of Hiroshima\n\nSouth Korea's Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed \"deep disappointment and concern\" over the ministers' visit and said Japan's leaders must show their \"deep remorse through action.\"\n\nJapanese Internal Affairs Minister Sanae Takaichi, one of the ministers who offered prayers at the shrine, told reporters: \"We decide how we want to pay respects to the war dead. This should not be a diplomatic problem.\"\n\nIn a speech on Saturday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Seoul was willing to talk to Tokyo to resolve longstanding disputes related to the war. Ties between the two countries have been strained over a row about compensation for Koreans forced to work in Japan's wartime factories and mines.\n\n\"Our government is ready to sit face to face with the Japanese government at any time,\" the Yonhap news agency quoted Moon as saying.\n\nJapan's revered war criminals Hideki Tojo Hideki Tojo was Japan's prime minister from 1941 to 1944 and Chief of Staff of the Japanese Imperial Army.

Japan used this as a pretext to declare war on China. Itagaki later fought in North Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia until he surrendered in 1945. He was found guilty of escalating the war and was hanged in 1948.\n\nJapan's revered war criminals Akira Muto Ever since the outbreak of the war, Muto fought in China and was later found guilty of taking part in several atrocities, including the Nanjing massacre.

In 1946, he died of tuberculosis before being sentenced.\n\nJapan's revered war criminals Osami Nagano Marshal Admiral Osami Nagano, a supporter of the Japanese attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor, ordered the attack on December 7, 1941.

He was sentenced to life in prison, but was released in 1952. He died that same year.\n\nJapan's revered war criminals Kuniaki Koiso Koiso was Japan's prime minister between July 1944 and April 1945, and served in China and North Korea. He was sentenced to life in prison although the tribunal was of the view he didn't take direct part in the atrocities committed by the military. The judges, however, ruled that he had been in a position to put a stop to them. Koiso died of cancer in 1950 while serving his jail sentence.\n\nJapan's revered war criminals Yoshijiro Umezu From 1939 to 1945, Umezu was in command of the 700,000-strong Guandong Army based in northeastern China. Although he opposed a Japanese surrender shortly before the end of the war, Umezu (seen here in uniform in the first row) was ordered by the emperor to sign the document of unconditional surrender on September 2, 1945. He was sentenced to life in prison and died in jail in 1949.\n\nJapan's revered war criminals Shigenori Togo Togo was an expert on Germany.
