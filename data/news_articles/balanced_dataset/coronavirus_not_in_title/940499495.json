They were taken by ambulance and helicopter to the General Hospital of Alicante and the Sant Joan d\u2019Alacant Hospital. The N-332 highway was closed for about four hours.\n\nThe accident occurred around three in the afternoon at kilometer 128 of the N-332 highway, within an area that has seem many previous serious accidents.\n\nThe Civil Guard Trafico are currently investigating the accident but in a statement released to the press they say that a Mercedes passenger car occupied by three young people from the Petrer area was driving in the direction of Benidorm when, on driving round a steep bend, it crossed into the opposite lane and collided head-on with a motorhome in which a Dutch couple were traveling. The section of road where the accident occurred is limited to 60 kilometres per hour.\n\nThe impact was devastating and the occupants of both vehicles were trapped inside.\n\nGiven the severity of the crash, several crews from the Provincial Firefighters Consortium, patrols from the Civil Traffic Guard, two SAMU ambulances, another two from Basic Life Support (SVB) and a medicalized helicopter were called to the scene.\n\nThe man who was driving the Dutch motorhome and one of the young men from the car both died from the impact of the collision and were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nEfforts were focused on the other seriously injured individuals. A 73-year-old Dutch woman was evacuated to the Sant Joan Hospital, the same centre to which one of the injured pasengers was also transferred by helicopter, while the other was taken to the General Hospital of Alicante.\n\nHelicopter unable to land in Alicante\n\nThis tragic accident has highlighted, once again, the need for a helipad to be set up in the Alicante general Hospital for the helicopter to land. Currently the helicopter has to land in Mutxamel airport and lose a valuable time in then transferring patients to the hospital, time that could save lives. The General de Alicante is the centre where the most critically injured are regularly transferred, hence the need for this landing pad.\n\nThe young man who was evacuated by helicopter yesterday in El Campello was transferred to the Sant Joan Hospital as he was unable to be landed in Alicante.\n\nImages courtesy Alicante Bomberos", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "el campello, head on crash, n332, spanish news, spain, costa blanca, costa de almeria, costa del sol", "original-source": "https://www.theleader.info/2020/08/13/two-dead-and-three-seriously-injured-on-n332-in-el-campello-crash/", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Two dead and three seriously injured on N332 in El Campello crash - The Leader Newspaper", "description": "A 19-year-old man from C\u00e1ceres who was on holiday in Alicante and a 75-year-old Dutch tourist both lost their lives on Wednesday in a traffic accident involving a head on crash between a car and a motorhome on the N-332 road, on the outskirts of El Campello.
