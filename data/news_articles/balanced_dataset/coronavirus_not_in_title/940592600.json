continues", "TEXT": "Jihadists have reportedly taken the northern Mozambican port of Mocimboa da Praia, according to various media sites, as Mozambican security forces have entered the area in order to wrest it from the Islamic fighters.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nFifty-nine presumed terrorists were killed on Wednesday, according to a statement released by the government, but it has refused to indicate there is a battle between government forces and jihadists for Mocimboa da Praia.\n\nPart of the lack of information is directly related to both a media blackout and an internet cut in the city.\n\nMocimboa da Praia, located in the far north of the country, near the Tanzanian border, is a strategic port near a number of natural gas sites.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the fourth time the insurgents have attacked this city, and it\u2019s important to know that a number of insurgents are originally from that city, so this is strategic, but also emotional, personal,\u201d Eric Morier-Genoud, a researcher at the University of Belfast, told RFI.\n\n\u201cThe thing that is different about this attack is that a major part of the population has left and the city has been reinforced by new, special army units, so it\u2019s a bigger victory in that sense,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe rebels said a few days ago that they don\u2019t just want to capture the city for a time, but re-capture it permanently,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe militants are reportedly linked to the Islamic State armed group (IS) and the alleged capture of the strategic port was seen as a big setback for Mozambican troops.\n\nThe country\u2019s neighbors are also worried about the fighting\u2014Tanzania has reportedly stated it would launch an offensive from their southernmost forest bordering Mozambique.\n\n#Tanzania has also said it will launch an offensive against the #IslamicState jihadists in forests along the border with #Mozambique. \u2014 Olivier Guitta (@OlivierGuitta) August 13,
