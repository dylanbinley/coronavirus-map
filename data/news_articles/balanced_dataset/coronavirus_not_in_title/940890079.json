His first visit in that capacity was made in 2017 as Francis\u2019s representative for the World Day of the Sick, and he returned a year later for the St. Francis de Sales Days, an annual event dedicated to Catholic media.\n\nThis year\u2019s National Pilgrimage to Lourdes is taking place Aug. 12-17 under the title, \u201cCome to the Source of Love.\u201d\n\nUsually bustling with thousands of pilgrims from all over the world, this year the shrine will be relatively empty.\n\nGiven the ongoing coronavirus crisis, rather than holding a major event with pilgrims, hospital workers, and the sick and infirm, only a small delegation will represent each of these categories.\n\nAccording to the French bishops, these delegations have a twofold task while in Lourdes: To represent the pilgrims unable to attend, and to provide on-site services to pilgrims who do manage to make it to the shrine.\n\nDue to safety precautions in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19, pilgrims and faithful who are sick \u2013 and who are usually the protagonists of activities at Lourdes \u2013 were not able to attend the Mass, but were invited to watch the televised event.\n\nOne of the most important elements at Lourdes are the baths available to pilgrims who wish to immerse themselves in the waters of the spring which, according to tradition, appeared when Mary told Bernadette to eat weeds and drink water that emerged when she dug into the dirt at the foot of the grotto in order to make reparation for sins.\n\nSince then, the waters are said to have miraculous properties, leading to numerous physical and spiritual healings.\n\nThe baths were closed due to the coronavirus outbreak, and they remain closed for full immersion. However, pilgrims who wish can still go to the bath stalls at four specific time slots per day, where a shrine staff member or volunteer will give them a portion of water from the spring, which they can either drink, or wash themselves.\n\nIn an interview with Vatican News, Father Nicola Ventriglia, chaplain of the Lourdes shrine, said they are offering this to pilgrims because, \u201cJust as Mary made Bernadette have a beautiful experience, we want to make the faithful who are present to feel good.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Parolin\u2019s presence for the Assumption, Ventriglia said \u201cHis presence is an encouragement for us in this very difficult moment\u201d and also \u201cbrings us the closeness of our beloved Holy Father.\u201d\n\nPrior to his visit to Lourdes, Parolin made an Aug. 4 visit to Ars on the feast day of St. John Vianney, known as the Crua de Ars, or, \u201cthe priest of Ars,\u201d to celebrate Mass and speak at a conference titled, \u201cPope Francis and the priest: walking with the People of God.\u201d\n\nIn his homily at Ars, Parolin told priests attending that not only did John Vianney participate in the healing power of God, but he also inspired numerous vocations to the priesthood. He also told them not to be discouraged by the \u201cdeviant behavior\u201d of some priests, explaining that the call to the priesthood is a free and \u201ctotally undeserved\u201d gift to be accepted \u201cwith humility and prayer.\u201d\n\nJohn Vianney, he said, \u201cteaches us to transmit joy and hope through the witness of our personal life and to be constant and persevering in our ministry.\u201d\n\nFollow Elise Ann Allen on Twitter: @eliseannallen", "METADATA": {"generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.2", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "description": "In his biggest public appearance since the coronavirus outbreak earlier this year, on Saturday the Vatican Secretary of State, Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, was scheduled to preside over Mass for the solemnity of the Assumption at the Marian shrine in Lourdes, France.", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Top Vatican official makes visit to Lourdes Mass on the Assumption", "description": "In his biggest public appearance since the coronavirus outbreak earlier this year, on Saturday the Vatican Secretary of State, Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, was scheduled to preside over Mass for the solemnity of the Assumption at the Marian shrine in Lourdes, France.", "url": "https://cruxnow.com/church-in-europe/2020/08/top-vatican-official-makes-visit-to-lourdes-mass-on-the-assumption/", "site_name": "Crux", "image": {"identifier": "https://cruxnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200626T0905-2876-CNS-ROME-PILGRIMAGE-LOURDES_800.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 561}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-15T02:31:16+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cruxnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Crux-favicon-web-500x500-1-300x300.png"}}}
