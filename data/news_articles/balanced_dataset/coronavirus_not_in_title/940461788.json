While soldiers are due to arrive in Netzarim the following day, the hopeful and faith-filled settlers carry on with their day-to-day tasks of building new homes, tending to their greenhouses, and planting new saplings, as if they will be living there forever.\n\nIn addition to filming her own family, Neta Sternberg unobtrusively focuses her lens on the parents and children of two other young families, including the Fogel family, five of whom will be brutally murdered by Arabs six years later in their new home in Itamar, where they relocated after their expulsion from Netzarim.\n\n\u201cTheir massacre was a breaking point for Neta,\u201d her older sister Yehudit told me. \u201cUntil then, she hadn\u2019t looked at all the video cassettes she had filmed in Netzarim. In the after-trauma of the expulsion, she didn\u2019t want to examine the footage and edit the film. When the Fogels were murdered, she gave the footage to me and told me to finish the movie.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how I ended up to be the director. Neta agreed to appear at the end of the film to speak about her feelings, and we filmed the parents of the Fogels to complete the story and to highlight the faith and courage that the Netzarim community symbolizes for me \u2013 the almost uncanny ability to rise up from the ashes and dust to make a new beginning, even when you have to continue again and again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the history of Am Yisrael, which survived the destruction of their communities for 2,000 years, again and again, whenever and wherever we thought we had found a home. To continue to plant and to build and to believe in Hashem. The eternal hope and invincibility of the Jewish nation.\n\n\u201cI know that is the meaning of the film for my parents. For me and Neta, and for audiences who come to screenings of the movie all over the country, religious and secular, young people and old, the message is more personal.\u201d\n\nI asked Yehudit to explain.\n\nShe said editing the 150 hours of Neta\u2019s footage led to a personal catharsis. \u201cThe loss of our home and community in Netzarim wasn\u2019t the first time our family had been expelled by our own government and soldiers. I was four years old when bulldozers razed our home in Yamit in the Sinai. For years afterward, I had flashbacks during the day and nightmares at night. My mother as well.\n\n\u201cDuring the evacuation of Gush Katif, I stayed away. I couldn\u2019t face reliving the same experience all over again. I was 28 at the time, married, with children of my own. My husband traveled to Netzarim to be with my family, but I couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want my children to experience the feelings of helplessness, frustration, and pain that I knew my parents and my brother and sisters were feeling. I didn\u2019t want them to see the anguish on the faces of people thrown out of their homes, the way I still see in my mind the anguish on the faces of my parents when I think about my childhood in Yamit.\n\n\u201cIt was only when I was working on the movie that I realized the depth of the trauma that I still carried from that overwhelming experience \u2013 the price we had to pay for a peace treaty with Egypt. Somehow, working on the movie and being a vehicle for the people of Netzarim to voice their own hopes and anxieties brought healing to me as well.\u201d\n\nIn a scene in the movie, when the police and soldiers arrive to carry out the evacuation, 19-year-old Neta runs out of the house and wanders in turmoil over the sand dunes surrounding the besieged settlement. I asked her how she feels now, 15 years later.\n\n\u201cWell, for one thing, I don\u2019t go to the beach very often. Whenever I do, the memories of Netzarim come back to haunt me. For years, I had frightening dreams of being by a stormy ocean while an earthquake shook my whole body.\n\n\u201cOnce I sensed that the sand I was standing upon was the soul of Netzarim and that the ground was quaking because there were no longer Jews there, as if the earth itself were crying like our Matriarch Rachel, weeping for her exiled children and praying for them to come home.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour memories are all nightmares?\u201d I ask her.\n\n\u201cNo. I remember what a beautiful, magical place we lived in. There was nothing like Gush Katif in all of Israel. Just like Jerusalem is unique, and the Golan is unique, Gush Katif had a charm and specialness all of its own.\u201d\n\nI inquire, \u201cIf you could go back today, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Definitely,\u201d she replied. \u201cI think that most of us would.\u201d\n\nI asked her what she thought about the movie.\n\n\u201cAfter the expulsion, I left all of the video cassettes in the cartons I had packed them in when the trucks came to take away our belongings. I didn\u2019t want to look at them and have to remember how my mother sat at the table in the salon, her head buried in her hands, and how my father sat slumped on the couch, uncharacteristically speechless, his gaze filled with sadness, when the soldiers entered the house with the order for us to leave.\n\n\u201cI filmed those horrible moments, focusing my camera on my father as he shook his head back and forth in disbelief as a Hebrew-speaking officer of the Israel Defense Forces politely asked us to pack up and join our neighbors outside on the street. My father jumped up with the idea to take down the large menorah from the roof of the beit knesset and take it with us to Jerusalem, in a symbolic procession to the kotel, the whole Netzarim community together.\n\n\u201cI filmed the eerie scene. Who doesn\u2019t think of the sculpture on the Arch of Titus depicting the menorah of the Beit HaMikdash being carried off to Rome when he sees the heartrending procession in the film? All the more so when the expulsion from Gush Katif came at the time of Tisha B\u2019Av when we mourn the destruction of Jerusalem and exile from our Land.\n\n\u201cA few months later, I lost my camera and took it as a sign from Heaven that my involvement in the film had finished, and that I had better start to look to the future rather than dwell on the past. Many people in the yishuv had told me that I was wasting my time making a movie since a movie couldn\u2019t capture the deep feelings in our hearts.\n\n\u201cIn my mourning over Gush Katif, I accepted what they said and abandoned the project. It wasn\u2019t until the massacre at the Fogel home in Itamar that I understood the importance of the movie.\n\n\u201cFor people watching the news on television, Ruth Fogel was just a name. I realized that I had hours of her on tape, talking, laughing, crying, explaining to her little children why everything was all for the best. In some small way, I felt that finishing the movie could bring her alive again. So I gave the material to my sister to complete the film for me.\n\n\u201cNow I am very glad. The story affects everyone who sees it, no matter where they come from. For them it is more than an ordinary movie. It makes them feel like they were there, with us in Netzarim.\u201d\n\nThe oldest son in the Sternberg family, Moshe, has been studying Torah at the Mercaz HaRav Kook Yeshiva in Jerusalem for the past 12 years. His wife teaches in the dati ulpana for girls in Gedera where they live. A few evenings a week, Moshe gives Torah classes to the general Gedera community.\n\n\u201cI was 16 years old when Netzarim was destroyed,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, it was a time of great strengthening. There was an incredible feeling of comradeship and togetherness all during the struggle to save the Gush. Up to the very end, we were singing, hand in hand, as we carried the menorah from the beit knesset and began the long journey to the Kotel.\n\n\u201cFor most of my friends, the expulsion fortified our belief. As the song says, an eternal nation isn\u2019t afraid of the long and difficult road to redemption. True, I know people whose faith was broken, and who, in anger, took off their kippot and turned away from the Torah. I understand their reaction. It isn\u2019t something readily comprehensible when your own Jewish army and Jewish government throws you out of your home in the Jewish homeland.\n\n\u201cBut Hashem\u2019s ways are not our ways, and who are we to question His doings? We say in our daily prayers that tribulations come to Yaakov, the Jewish people, and from them we are saved. Precisely through the sufferings. That\u2019s the path to our redemption.\u201d\n\nI asked Moshe why some of his friends remained strong in the aftermath of the expulsion while for others the trauma was like a betrayal they could neither forgive nor forget?\n\n\u201cEveryone is different. I think for me, my parents were an example for me to emulate. If people were needed to live in Yamit, they went to Yamit. After the withdrawal from Sinai, they continued to be involved in the Gush Emunim movement. Afterwards, they went on shlichut to America on a project to encourage families to make aliyah and settle in Judea and Samaria.\n\n\u201cWhen people were needed to strengthen the community in Netzarim, they built a house in Netzarim. Even though my father didn\u2019t agree with all the strategies of Moetzet Yesha and the Gush Katif Council during the campaign to prevent the expulsion, he worked with them and organized the biggest demonstrations like the mass protest in Tel Aviv.\n\n\u201cToday as well, he hops from one idealist project to the next, wherever Am Yisrael needs help. He\u2019s like a children\u2019s punching bag, the kind you knock down and it bounces back up at you. My parents look at life as a challenge. They don\u2019t let setbacks get them down.\n\n\u201cRabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook, the head of the Mercaz HaRav Yeshiva when my father learned there, taught that setbacks were only temporary. Like a gazelle which appears on a mountain peak, then disappears before it appears on another \u2013 such is the redemption of Am Yisrael. \u2018Kimah, kimah,\u2019 the Gemara teaches, a little at a time, like the dawning of day.\n\n\u201cSetbacks don\u2019t mean that the journey is finished and the goal has been destroyed. On the contrary, setbacks are a sign that you are on the right course. A child falls and stands up, falls and stands up. That\u2019s how he or she learns to walk. That\u2019s the path in the life of an individual, and, all the more so in the life of the Jewish nation \u2013 just like a punching bag that bounces back at you.\u201d\n\nI asked Moshe if he felt no after-effects of anger.\n\n\u201cSure I feel anger. I think about the expulsion every day. We talk about it at family gatherings. But my anger is directed at Arik Sharon, at the weakness of the government, at the pettiness of politicians who act out of self-interest, at the evil-mindedness of the leftist media, and at Jews who take relish watching fellow Jews get thrown out of their homes because they wear kippot and tzitzit.\n\n\u201cBut I push the anger aside and look forward, knowing that our promised future of teshuvah and blessing will certainly come true. Our Sages warned us that before the final Redemption, the Torah and its scholars would be scorned, and that truth will be forgotten, and that the economy will be like it is today. So we all should be happy. According to the signs of the Talmud, we are on the right track, and getting closer to Mashiach all the time.\u201d\n\nThe patriarch of the family, Yaacov Sternberg, is currently heading a new grassroots movement to help charedi Jews make aliyah, as The Jewish Press reported last week.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if we could build homes for them on the sand dunes in Netzarim?\u201d he said with a smile during our conversation this week.\n\n\u201cIs there a plan to return to Gush Katif?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard about any concrete plans. Certainly, there are a lot of hopes and prayers. Just last week, the Minister of Settlement Affairs Tzachi Hanegbi stated that, in all likelihood, Israel would have to restore Israeli sovereignty over the Gaza Strip to end the rocket attacks once and for all time. Ironically, he was one of Sharon\u2019s leading front men in selling the Disengagement idea to the public.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat conclusions have you drawn 15 years after the fact?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, on a national level, I learned two things. One is the importance of grassroots activism in swaying public opinion. Hundreds of thousands of people from across the country participated in the campaign to save Gush Katif and the settlements in the Shomron. True, the great majority was religious, and that is something which needs correction, but we almost succeeded.\n\n\u201cEhud Olmert recently revealed that Arik Sharon phoned him during our campaign to tell him that the pressure against him from the public and from within the Likud party was so intense that he was changing the plan to include only five yishuvim. That would have prevented Gaza from becoming an easy launching pad for their missiles. Olmert said that he persuaded Sharon to stick to his original plan.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, maybe if our campaign had been more aggressive, we would have succeeded in overturning the evil decree. The other conclusion is that we must work to increase the nation\u2019s love for Eretz Yisrael so that no one would ever think of handing away pieces, not for anything in the world.\n\n\u201cThis, I believe, can only be done by bringing people closer to Jewish history, Jewish heritage, and Torah. The only way to do this is through Jewish education and more Jewish education, both in Israel and in chutz la\u2019aretz.\u201d\n\nThe documentary \u201cBetween Heaven and Sand\u201d can be rented at www.Movie-Discovery.com.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://www.jewishpress.com/wp-content/uploads/Gush-081420-Menorah.jpg", "url": "https://www.jewishpress.com/blogs/felafel-on-rye/netzarim-family-recalls-a-nightmare/2020/08/13/", "type": "article", "title": "Netzarim Family Recalls A Nightmare", "description": "It isn't something readily comprehensible when your own Jewish army and Jewish government throw you out of your home in the Jewish homeland."}, "author": "Tzvi Fishman", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.jewishpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/JP-Logo-200.jpg"}}}
