Lewis described Israel as a refuge for Jews whose history was shaped as black people\u2019s history is, by slavery and genocide, and being \u201cuprooted involuntarily from their homeland.\u201d\n\nLewis was \u201cone of Israel\u2019s strongest advocates in Congress,\u201d David Harris of the American Jewish Committe said in a eulogy to America\u2019s \u201cmoral conscience.\u201d Lewis traveled to Israel \u201con numerous occasions,\u201d the AJC\u2019s Atlanta director noted. While AIPAC remembered Lewis\u2019s support for Israeli occupation:\n\nCongressman Lewis was a steadfast ally of the Jewish state who was instrumental in gaining passage of The Jerusalem Embassy Act.\n\nArab America\u2019s obit says that Lewis was historically deferential to the Israel lobby but revised his views somewhat in recent years.\n\nLewis came to the Palestinian human rights later in his life, especially after a lifelong allegiance to Israel.\n\nNotably, Lewis a year ago was an early co-sponsor of Rep. Ilhan Omar\u2019s bill in Congress to affirm that boycott is a free speech right in the pursuit of human rights abroad. The bill was aimed at countering legislation to punish BDS supporters. Lewis justified the sponsorship by speaking of the importance of boycotts in the civil rights movement in the South; though at the same time he opposed BDS and supported legislation that characterized the BDS campaign as antisemitic.\n\nFL Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz gushed over John Lewis\u2019s backing of Israel on an AJC webinar yesterday dedicated to Lewis\u2019s progressive achievements.\n\nHe was a stalwart supporter of Israel and understood that two states for two peoples was absolutely critical, that everyone, every group that has an identity, deserves to be able to have a state, to have a touchstone, a place that they can call home, that is a refuge. And that\u2019s certainly what Israel has been for Jews, and the essential need to preserve that safe haven after thousands of years of persecution, John really understood that. And understood it also in terms of his support for a two state solution where the Palestinian people need and deserve a state as well, and continuing to advance and press the two communities to return to the negotiating table, and engage in direct bilateral negotiations.\n\nArab America\u2018s obit by John Mason quotes a Palestinian-American, Wally Yazbak, saying that Lewis\u2019s record wasn\u2019t as pro-Israel as these groups make it out to be.\n\nYazbak noted during the interview the occasions on which Lewis voted favorably towards Arabs, one being the Congressman\u2019s vote against the Iraq war. He was one of few elected officials in the House or the Senate to cast a negative vote against a war whose negative repercussions are still present. On another issue, the status of Jerusalem, Lewis told Yazbak that all peoples should share this holy city. When asked why he thought Lewis was slow to come to the support of Palestinians, contrasted with his steadfast backing of Israel, Yazbak responded, \u201cLewis was misled\u201d by the numerous American pro-Israel lobbies and other political forces that proclaim Israel can do no wrong and that Palestinians are simply a drag on Israel\u2019s efforts to expand the Israeli state. Lewis also showed signs of increasing support for Palestinians in his vote to release hundreds of West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem minors arbitrarily arrested, confined and abused in Israeli prisons.\n\nYazbak told a story of having met Lewis at the Jimmy Carter Center in Atlanta in 2018, when Lewis said, \u201cJerusalem belongs to all religions and no one can just give it away to one religion.\u201d\n\nLewis\u2019s support of Ilhan Omar\u2019s pro-boycott bill was a welcome surprise, Ariel Gold wrote in the Forward last summer. She reviewed Lewis\u2019s long record as a \u201cstaunch supporter\u201d of Israel\u2013 even signing a letter supportive of Israel at a time of expanding settlements.\n\nIn 2015, less than a year since the Israeli assault on Gaza that killed over 2,000 people, Lewis said, \u201cIn this Congress, I take a backseat to no one in my commitment and support of Israel and the American Jewish community.\u201d\u2026 [H]e has been eerily silent about Israel\u2019s attacks on Palestinians. In March 2018, when Senator Bernie Sanders and Reps. Betty McCollum, Barbara Lee, Keith Ellison, and others condemned Israel\u2019s murder of unarmed Palestinian protestors in Gaza \u2014 murders that the UN said likely amounted to war crimes \u2014 Lewis said nothing.\n\nIn a 2002 op-ed Lewis said that he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the UN resolution equating Zionism with racism and averred that Martin Luther King Jr. was a vigorous supporter of Israel.\n\n[King] consistently reiterated his stand on the Israel- Arab conflict, stating \u201cIsrael\u2019s right to exist as a state in security is uncontestable.\u201d It was no accident that King emphasized \u201csecurity\u201d in his statements on the Middle East.\n\nLewis made an identification of Jews and blacks in that article, as particularly victimized groups.\n\n[King] knew that both peoples were uprooted involuntarily from their homelands. He knew that both peoples were shaped by the tragic experience of slavery. He knew that both peoples were forced to live in ghettoes, victims of segregation\u2026.He knew that both peoples have been subjected to oppression and genocide on a level unprecedented in history.\n\nThe AJC expressed concern yesterday about how it could carry John Lewis\u2019s regard for Israel over to the next generation of black politicians. Apparently, this concern does not extend to Nikema Williams, chair of Georgia\u2019s Democratic Party and a state senator, who has been selected to run for Lewis\u2019s seat. Melissa Weiss of Jewish Insider tweeted a photo of Williams in Israel \u201con a 2018 trip to Israel with the American Israel Education Foundation,\u201d which is an arm of the Israel lobby group AIPAC.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The late John Lewis was a steadfast supporter of Israel, calling it a refuge for people shaped by slavery who has been \u201cuprooted \u2026from their homeland.\u201d", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/0820_john-lewis1.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 881}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "John Lewis, civil rights icon, is also mourned by pro-Israel groups \u2013 Mondoweiss", "description": "The late John Lewis was a steadfast supporter of Israel, calling it a refuge for people shaped by slavery who has been \u201cuprooted \u2026from their homeland.\u201d", "url": "https://mondoweiss.net/2020/07/john-lewis-civil-rights-icon-is-also-mourned-by-pro-israel-groups/", "site_name": "Mondoweiss", "updated_time": "2020-07-23T19:03+00:00"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mondoweiss", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/philip.weiss.180", "published_time": "2020-07-23T19:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-07-23T19:03+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@mondoweiss", "creator": "@PhilWeiss", "title": "John Lewis, civil rights icon, is also mourned by pro-Israel groups \u2013 Mondoweiss", "description": "The late John Lewis was a steadfast supporter of Israel, calling it a refuge for people shaped by slavery who has been \u201cuprooted \u2026from their homeland.\u201d", "image": {"identifier": "https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/0820_john-lewis1.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 881}}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cropped-mw-m-square-xlg-270x270.png"}}}
