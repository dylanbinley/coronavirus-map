The Juan Santamar\u00eda airport is one of the busiest in Central America.\n\nWhen officials announced the reopening in late July, it said citizens of the U.K., Canada and the European Union would be permitted to enter Costa Rica if they provided negative COVID-19 test results, according to Reuters.\n\nA spokesperson for Southwest Airlines said the Dallas-based airline hopes to restart service to Liberia in the Northwest Guanacaste province of Costa Rica in November with once daily service to and from Houston Hobby Airport, pending approval from Costa Rican officials. The Liberia airport is popular with tourists visiting the Pacific Ocean coast and western Costa Rica.\n\nTexans would be able to connect from Houston Hobby to Dallas.\n\nAmerican Airlines is seeking approval to fly \u201ca few\u201d repatriation flights between DFW Airport and the Santamar\u00eda airport in August, and flights from Miami International Airport to San Jose on Sept. 9, according to company spokeswoman Nichelle Barrett.\n\nUnited, Alaska, Spirit and Volaris airlines have also made proposals to resume flights to the Central American country, according to QCostaRica, citing Costa Rican officials.\n\nStill, only residents of foreign countries that have \u201ccontrolled the spread of the coronavirus\u201d will be permitted to enter Costa Rica, according to the U.S. Embassy there. The country has reported 24,508 cases of COVID-19 as of Aug. 11.\n\nBesides Mexico and Brazil, air travel to countries in Central and South America remains mostly off limits to U.S. citizens. Those that allow it have instituted requirements ranging from providing proof of a negative COVID-19 test to quarantining for two weeks upon arrival.\n\nAmericans represent the largest group of international travelers to Costa Rica, with 1.33 million arrivals last year, according to Costa Rica tourism data. That was up 5.5% over 2018. In all, Costa Rica saw 3.14 million foreign visitors in 2019.", "METADATA": {"twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@dallasnews", "creator": "@dallasnews", "title": "American, Southwest Airlines seek approval to resume flights to Costa Rica", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/LG9Yb6KiXmCPKfb5YkX4geZFz54=/1200x630/smart/filters:no_upscale()/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/dmn/5RS4QZLOHFAE3D5VWVVTGMI544.jpg", "alt": "An American Airlines 737 descends for a landing at DFW International Airport."}, "description": "Dallas-Fort Worth-based American and Southwest Airlines have joined four other carriers in seeking approval from Costa Rican officials to let them resume..."}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "19895CC0CAFBF42741C03BC7B3FBC0C8", "norton-safeweb-site-verification": "1xgiu2x94l2h70xibyhunkuga-377twdekufdak6z-evwwcxpgjt91zskqb1ktua3oc0366zusmvc3895w250xejc2a1w36v1ktx6k8v3bqfpc5ubsghl1xwax9xcr1f", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "resources/motif/images/favicon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#329ce8", "google-site-verification": "1sN1NT61uZZjHw7oko0MGYoZtHfsgKx0I0eqSUkKQxs", "fb": {"page_id": 20946638799, "admins": 1043783589}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dallasmorningnews", "content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "published_time": "2020-08-13T19:29:21.368Z", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T04:32:46.539Z", "section": "Airlines"}, "og": {"title": "American, Southwest Airlines seek approval to resume flights to Costa Rica", "description": "Dallas-Fort Worth-based American and Southwest Airlines have joined four other carriers in seeking approval from Costa Rican officials to let them resume...", "url": "https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2020/08/13/american-southwest-airlines-seek-approval-to-resume-flights-to-costa-rica/", "image": {"identifier": "https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/LG9Yb6KiXmCPKfb5YkX4geZFz54=/1200x630/smart/filters:no_upscale()/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/dmn/5RS4QZLOHFAE3D5VWVVTGMI544.jpg", "alt": "An American Airlines 737 descends for a landing at DFW International Airport.", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "site_name": "Dallas News", "type": "article"}, "description": "Dallas-Fort Worth-based American and Southwest Airlines have joined four other carriers in seeking approval from Costa Rican officials to let them resume...", "vf": {"container_id": "L4KCYXBVG5GM5HNBCJZHESLPO4"}, "profile": {"first_name": "Dom", "last_name": "DiFurio"}}}}
