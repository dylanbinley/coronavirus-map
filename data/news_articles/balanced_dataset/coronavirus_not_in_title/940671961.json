It also firms up opposition to regional power Iran, which the UAE, Israel and the United States view as the main threat in the conflict-riven Middle East.\n\nIsrael had signed peace agreements with Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994. But the UAE, along with most other Arab nations, did not recognize Israel and had no formal diplomatic or economic relations with it until now. It becomes the first Gulf Arab country to reach such a deal with the Jewish state.\n\nOfficials from the three countries called the accord \u201chistoric\u201d and a breakthrough toward peace. But Palestinian leaders, apparently taken by surprise, denounced it as a \u201cstab in the back\u201d to their cause.\n\nA joint statement said Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Abu Dhabi\u2019s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed had \u201cagreed to the full normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates\u201d.\n\nThe accord will allow the two countries \u201cto chart a new path that will unlock the great potential in the region,\u201d it said.\n\nIsrael and the UAE are expected soon to exchange ambassadors and embassies. A signing ceremony is due to be held at the White House.\n\n\u201cAs a result of this diplomatic breakthrough and at the request of President Trump with the support of the United Arab Emirates, Israel will suspend declaring sovereignty\u201d over areas of the West Bank as envisioned in a U.S. plan announced by Trump in January, it said.\n\nThe agreement, to be known as the Abraham Accord, also gives Trump a foreign policy accomplishment as he seeks re-election on Nov. 3. Speaking in the White House Oval Office, Trump said similar deals are being discussed with other countries in the region.\n\nTrump said the agreement unites \u201ctwo of America\u2019s closest and most capable partners in the region\u201d and represents \u201ca significant step towards building a more peaceful, secure and prosperous Middle East.\u201d\n\nThe UAE said it would remain a strong supporter of the Palestinian people, who hope to create an independent state in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and that the agreement maintained the viability of a two-state solution to the longstanding Israel-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe accord could also be a personal boost to Netanyahu, who is on trial for alleged corruption and whose domestic popularity has dropped over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn a televised address, Netanyahu said the deal would lead to \u201cfull and formal peace\u201d with the UAE and voiced hope that other countries in the region would follow its example. It also entailed acceding to a request from Trump to \u201ctemporarily wait\u201d on implementing his annexation pledge, Netanyahu said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incomparably exciting moment, a historic moment for peace in the Middle East,\u201d Netanyahu added.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, however, rejected the accord. Spokesman Abu Rudeineh, reading from a statement outside Abbas\u2019s headquarters in Ramallah in the West Bank, said it was a \u201cbetrayal of Jerusalem, Al-Aqsa (mosque, Islam\u2019s third-holiest shrine) and the Palestinian cause\u201d.\n\nAsked if the Palestinian leadership had been aware the deal was coming, veteran negotiator Hanan Ashrawi told Reuters: \u201cNo. We were blindsided. ... It is a complete sell-out.\u201d\n\nIn Gaza, Fawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for the armed Islamist group Hamas, said: \u201cNormalisation is a stab in the back of the Palestinian cause and it serves only the Israeli occupation.\u201d\n\nThe UAE\u2019s Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed said the agreement would stop further Israeli annexation of Palestinian territories, for which Israel had been awaiting a green light from Washington.\n\nSenior UAE official Anwar Gargash said the deal had helped defuse what he called a ticking time-bomb. Gargash urged the Israelis and Palestinians to return to the negotiating table.\n\n\u2018NIGHTMARE\u2019 FOR IRAN\n\nTrump\u2019s special envoy Brian Hook called the agreement a \u201cnightmare\u201d for Iran. An Iranian official said the agreement would not secure peace in the region.\n\nRailing against \u201ccriminal Israel\u201d, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, a special adviser to Iran\u2019s parliamentary speaker, said in a tweet: \u201cAbu Dhabi\u2019s behavior has no justification, turning back on the Palestine cause. W/ that strategic mistake, #UAE will be engulfed in Zionism fire.\u201d\n\nIran and Israel are arch-foes. Israel is particularly concerned about suspected Iranian efforts to develop nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies. Iran is also involved in proxy wars from Syria to Yemen, where the UAE has been a leading member of the Saudi-led coalition opposing Iran-aligned forces there.\n\nWith a population of less than 10 million but the Arab world\u2019s second-largest economy thanks to oil, the UAE has exerted growing commercial and military clout in the Gulf and the wider region over the past two decades, much of it aimed at confronting Islamist militants and the influence of Iran.\n\nDelegations from Israel and the United Arab Emirates will meet in the coming weeks to sign agreements regarding investment, tourism, direct flights, security, telecommunications and other issues, the joint statement said.\n\n\u201cEverybody said this would be impossible,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cNow that the ice has been broken, I expect more Arab and Muslim countries will follow the United Arab Emirates\u2019 lead,\u201d Trump added.\n\nThis was already being discussed with other states, he said.\n\nRead: Draft UN Resolution Condemns Israeli Annexation in Trump's Plan", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Delegations from Israel and the United Arab Emirates will meet in the coming weeks to sign agreements.", "keywords": "Israel, Arab, UAE, United Arab Emirates, Iran, Palestine, Trump, Politics, Benjamin Netanyahu", "author": "Laila Afifa", "fb": {"app_id": 332404380172618, "pages": 160355148441}, "og": {"locale": "id_ID", "type": "article", "url": "https://en.tempo.co/read/1375656/israel-uae-to-normalize-relations-in-shift-in-mideast-politics", "title": "Israel, UAE to Normalize Relations in Shift in Mideast Politics", "image": {"identifier": "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2020/04/02/id_927714/927714_720.jpg", "width": 720, "height": 405}, "site_name": "Tempo", "description": "Delegations from Israel and the United Arab Emirates will meet in the coming weeks to sign agreements."}, "robots": "index, follow", "yahoobot": "index, follow", "dable": {"item_id": 1375656, "author": "Tempo.co"}, "article": {"section": "asean_beyond", "section2": "asean_beyond_internasional", "published_time": "2020-08-14T08:40:00+07:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@tempodotco", "title": "Israel, UAE to Normalize Relations in Shift in Mideast Politics", "description": "Delegations from Israel and the United Arab Emirates will meet in the coming weeks to sign agreements.", "image": {"src": "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2020/04/02/id_927714/927714_720.jpg"}}, "adx": {"sections": "engteco_asean_beyond"}, "google-site-verification": "M2xcdJ5TZd5mAsle_IY5qEv42TAd08Jkheo4-7tovx4"}}}
