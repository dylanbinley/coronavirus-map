I think everybody understands that,' Mr Johnson told reporters.\n\n'We will be looking at the data a bit later on this afternoon - looking exactly where France and other countries are getting to.\n\n'We can't be remotely complacent about our own situation. Everybody understands that in a pandemic you don't allow our population to be reinfected or the disease to come back in.\n\n'That is why the quarantine measures are very important and we have to apply them in very strict way.'\n\nThe Prime Minister spoke as he visited Northern Ireland this afternoon ahead of an expected decision on which nations will be placed on the restricted travel list\n\nPictured: A graph showing the countries from which travellers arriving in the UK are currently exempt from the 14-day coronavirus quarantine, and the number of Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people in each country. Speculation is mounting that France could be removed from the list of exempt countries, but there a number of others that have higher or similar figures\n\nSpeculation has been mounting about quarantine exemptions being scrapped as infections rise across much of Europe.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Britons are either on holiday in France or planning to go there, but yesterday it recorded more than 2,500 cases - a record since lockdown was eased.\n\nThe country appears to be perilously close to the yardstick of 20 cases per 100,000 population in a seven-day period.\n\nBut ministers are believed to be prepared to hold off on restrictions when changes are announced today, with the situation kept under close observation.\n\nMailOnline understands that Malta and the Netherlands, which have higher prevalence, are more likely to be returned to the quarantine list - which already includes Spain and Portugal. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are not believed to have signed off on the adjustments yet.\n\nTravellers are expected to be given around 30 hours notice of any changes coming into force, so they can make new arrangements if required.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Britons are either on holiday in France or planning to go there, but yesterday it recorded more than 2,500 cases - a record since lockdown was eased.
