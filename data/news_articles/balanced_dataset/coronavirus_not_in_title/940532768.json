Aug 13 (Interfax) - The Moldovan presidential administration has described reports alleging that Moldovan President Igor Dodon spent his vacation in Crimea last week as \"fake news.\"\n\n\"We regret that new fake information regarding the alleged brief vacation of President Igor Dodon in Yalta, Crimea, has been released into the public sphere. This is another example of fake news. This information is untrue; it was published by certain political opponents specializing in the promotion of fake news. The president has already sued the portal for forging documents,\" the presidential press service said.\n\nThe press service noted that Dodon paid a working visit to Moscow last week to discuss issues important for the Moldovan economy with deputy head of the Russian presidential administration Dmitry Kozak.\n\nThe Internet portal Omega.md said on Wednesday, citing sources in the Moldovan embassy in Moscow, that, \"immediately after his meeting at the Russian presidential administration, Mr. President accepted an invitation to visit Crimea for a brief vacation. While in Crimea, Dodon stayed at a villa in the Crimean Breeze five-star residence in a Yalta suburb.\" According to Omega, Dodon returned to Chisinau last weekend, and his family flew from Crimea to Turkey to continue their vacation.", "METADATA": {"format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimal-scale=0.25, maximal-scale=3.0, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicon/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-config": "/img/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#af7348", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}}}
