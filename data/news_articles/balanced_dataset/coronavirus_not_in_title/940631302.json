There have been numerous reports of drivers being harassed, and cars being damaged, because they were spotted in Canada wearing American license plates.\n\nAlthough the Canada-U.S. border is officially closed, \u201cessential travel\u201d is still permitted.\n\nCanadians are also allowed to return home from the U.S., although they\u2019re required to quarantine for 14 days, and some are coming back with vehicles licensed in American states.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why Canadians are concerned. On August 13, Canada reported 4,690 active cases of COVID-19. In comparison, the U.S. reported 2.38 million active cases. Canada\u2019s pandemic death rate is 238 per 1 million people, while in the U.S. it\u2019s 511 per 1 million.\n\nCBC reports that many Canadian drivers with out-of-country plates are automatically assumed to be Americans, and are asked how they got into the country. While physical assaults appear to be rare, many people report verbal abuse, and some have reported their cars have been keyed or otherwise vandalized.\n\nIn July, an Ontario woman was accosted by a man for her Alabama license plates, since she spends part of her time working there. She decided to cheer herself up by buying a toy duck and leaving it on a nearby Jeep, sparking a fad that\u2019s since spread to the U.S., and even Spain and Australia.\n\nSome Americans have crossed into Canada as a route to Alaska, which the Canadian government permitted since there isn\u2019t any other way to drive between the Lower 48 and that northernmost state. But many drivers who said they were going straight through were later spotted going off-route to sight-see or shop, so Canada clamped down. Travellers to Alaska must enter at specified crossings and put a \u201chang tag\u201d on the mirror, indicating that they\u2019re going to Alaska and when they have to be there.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just American plates that are sparking issues. In Prince Edward Island, students and cottage owners have reported harassment and vehicle damage because their cars have plates from provinces with higher rates of COVID-19 infections. And even our own Matthew Guy, who lives in Nova Scotia, recently caught hell from a stranger for driving a car with Ontario plates. Times have sure changed for polite Canadians, eh?", "METADATA": {"ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "news_keywords": "instagram", "description": "Cars are being keyed and people are being assaulted, and sometimes those people are other Canadians", "keywords": "news, instagram", "og": {"title": "More Canadians attacking cars with American plates over pandemic fears", "url": "https://driving.ca/auto-news/news/more-canadians-attacking-cars-with-american-plates-over-pandemic-fears", "image": {"identifier": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/new-mexico-usa.jpg?w=600&h=315&crop=1&quality=80", "width": 200, "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "Cars are being keyed and people are being assaulted, and sometimes those people are other Canadians", "site_name": "Driving", "locale": "en_US"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "google-site-verification": "07pT7ge3hbVe3ABpbUr0NrPD3WB2zKxNUs5b2S0_IzM", "generator": "WordPress.com", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T17:29:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T20:33:19+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@drivingdotca", "site": "@drivingdotca", "text": {"title": "More Canadians attacking cars with American plates over pandemic fears"}, "image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/new-mexico-usa.jpg?w=600&h=315&crop=1&quality=80", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "More Canadians attacking cars with American plates over pandemic fears", "description": "Cars are being keyed and people are being assaulted, and sometimes those people are other Canadians"}, "fb": {"app_id": 199800443522415, "page_id": 7561650675}, "stats-full-init": "0.010", "stats-postmedia_theme_pre_initialize": "0.002", "stats-initialize": "0.008", "stats-postmedia_theme_post_initialize": "0.001", "stats-vip_load_plugins": "0.001", "stats-load_plugins": "0.005", "stats-register_widgets": "0.000", "sailthru.date": "2020-08-13 13:29:36", "sailthru.title": "More Canadians attacking cars with American plates over pandemic fears", "sailthru.description": "Cars are being keyed and people are being assaulted, and sometimes those people are other Canadians", "sailthru.image.full": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/new-mexico-usa.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/new-mexico-usa.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "brand-newandusedcarreviews,comparisonsandnews|driving, category-news, Canada, cars, many Canadian drivers, out-of-country plates, Ontario plates, polite Canadians, Canada U.S. border, U.S., tag, American states.It, Canadian government, nearby Jeep, COVID-19, 4,690 active cases, Alaska, American license, Canada's pandemic death rate, COVID-19 infections, coronavirus rules, rare , many people, cottage owners, Ontario woman", "application-name": "New and Used Car Reviews, Comparisons and News | Driving", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "The leading online destination for the latest automotive news, reviews, photos and video for Canadians.
