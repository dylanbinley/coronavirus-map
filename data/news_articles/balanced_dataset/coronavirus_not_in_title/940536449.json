He added: \u201cWe believe it is incredibly important for American national security that Europe have a diversified energy base. That they have multiple sources, that it doesn\u2019t have to depend on Russia for all of its energy.

In it, they pledged to block access to companies that might be subject to foreign state interference.\n\nIntelligence services in the Czech Republic, which is taking bids to create its 5G network until September, warned that Huawei and technology firm ZTE pose potential security risks.\n\nIn Slovenia, which is slated to call a tender to build its network by year-end, Huawei has called on the government to discuss safety, and offered to sign a no-spy agreement.\n\nNot all countries have agreed with the U.S. In Hungary, Trump-ally Viktor Orban has both commercial and political ties with Russia and China. His government doesn\u2019t see Huawei as a threat and will allow its equipment to be used in the 5G rollout.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "METADATA": {"civicscience": {"jspoll-hostname": "www138.civicscience.com"}, "application-name": "Slovenia Joins EU States in U.S. Push to Limit Huawei from 5G", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "World News", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Slovenia signed a declaration on 5G security, joining a group of countries agreeing with the U.S. to guard their networks in a way that could block China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co. from taking part.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}}}
