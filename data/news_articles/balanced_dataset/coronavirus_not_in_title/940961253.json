The Prince of Wales said: \"From the vantage point of the twenty-first century, it is hard for us to appreciate fully the suffering endured by those who fought, or were caught up in, this theatre of war. \"Drawing on his time as Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia Command my great uncle, Lord Mountbatten, helped me begin to understand the quite atrocious conditions experienced by our forces throughout South East Asia. \"But those of us not there at the time really can only begin to understand\u2026\n\nPrince Charles delivered a poignant speech to mark the 75th anniversary of VJ Day\n\nPrince Charles and his great uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten\n\n\"Lord Mountbatten told me about his experiences of that gruelling campaign in which our troops not only faced a determined opponent, but at the same time had to contend with an incredibly hostile jungle environment and the ever-present scourge of disease which claimed nearly a quarter of a million Allied casualties. \"At this point we should also reflect on those unfortunate prisoners of war, who suffered so dreadfully. \"Over a quarter of all Allied Prisoners of War lost their lives in captivity.\" READ MORE: Prince Charles dons medals as he steps in for Queen to lead on VJ Day\n\nPrince Charles, Lord Louis Mountbatten, Prince Philip and the Queen during a Jubilee naval review in 1977\n\nLord Mountbatten, killed by the IRA in 1979, famously counselled Prince Charles on several issues - including his love life. After having spoken to Charles about a possible marriage to his granddaughter, Amanda Knatchbull, Lord Mountbatten advised the Prince of Wales to seek for a future wife \"without a past\" the media could dig up. During WW2, one of Lord Mountbatten's biggest accomplishment was to oversee the recapture of Burma from the Japanese.
