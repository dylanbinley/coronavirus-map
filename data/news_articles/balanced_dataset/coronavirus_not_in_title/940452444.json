Any attempt to ignore, deny or challenge that principle is doomed to fail.\u201d The \u2018One China\u2019 policy refers to the idea that China is not split into different parts \u2013 including Taiwan, which the Chinese government sees as a \u2018breakaway province\u2019 of China, the BBC reports.
