We are also prepared to lend our active support to this process,\" added the statement.\n\n\n\nThe German government's spokesperson, Steffen Seibert, likewise expressed hope the treaty would pave the way to renew negotiations over the two-state solution.\n\n\n\nBelgium welcomes normalization\n\n\n\nof relations between UAE, Israel\n\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Belgium Friday welcomed the \"rapprochement between Israel and the UAE, facilitated by the US, as a step towards peace in the region\".\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Philippe Goffin, the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs and of Defense, said: \"The announcement of the suspension of annexation plans is a step in the right direction, but should be converted into a definitive measure.\"\n\n\n\nHe added that lasting peace in the region rests on \"a 2-state solution based on international law and internationally agreed parameters.\" \u2014 WAM", "METADATA": {"ROBOTS": "index,follow", "language": "English", "copyright": "Saudi Gazette", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Germany hails normalization of ties between UAE, Israel", "keywords": "saudigazette Newspaper, saudi sazette, saudigazette, Saudi Arabia, kingdom of saudi arabia, latest news, world, opinion, sports, business, technology, life, cartoon, king salman , Germany,hails,normalization,of,ties,between,UAE,,Israel", "Idkeywords": 867669, "pageType": "article", "url": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/article/596641/World/Europe/Germany-hails-normalization-of-ties-between-UAE-Israel", "datePublished": "2020-08-14 21:52:00", "dateModified": "2020-08-14 21:52:00", "inLanguage": "en", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Germany hails normalization of ties between UAE, Israel", "description": "Germany hails normalization of ties between UAE, Israel", "image": "https://saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2020/08/14/1617035.jpg"}, "og": {"url": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/article/596641/World/Europe/Germany-hails-normalization-of-ties-between-UAE-Israel", "title": "Germany hails normalization of ties between UAE, Israel", "description": "Germany hails normalization of ties between UAE, Israel", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "Saudigazette", "image": "https://saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2020/08/14/1617035.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14 21:52:00", "section": "World"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2020/08/14/1617035.jpg"}}}
