Further questions should be directed to the Lebanese authorities as the lead investigators,\" the FBI added.\n\nA law enforcement official said that the FBI could not provide details of what specific kind of assistance the bureau would provide and whether FBI personnel were already on their way to Beirut.\n\nU.S. government agencies have not publicly released any statements or materials indicating the view of U.S. investigators and spy agencies on the causes of the blast.\n\nHowever, U.S. government sources have privately said that based on the evidence presently available, U.S. agencies believe that the explosion at the hangar, where large quantities of potentially volatile ammonium nitrate were stored, was most likely an accident.\n\nThey are continuing to collect data, however, and are still considering the possibility that the explosion could have been some kind of deliberate attack, the sources said.\n\n(Reporting By Mark Hosenball; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall)", "METADATA": {"application-name": "U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to help Lebanon probe Beirut explosion", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "World News", "robots": "noindex, nofollow", "description": "U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to help Lebanon probe Beirut explosion", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}}}
