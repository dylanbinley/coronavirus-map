(Foreign Ministry)\n\nSix hundred Israeli tourists a week will be allowed to visit four Greek locations without the need for mandatory quarantine upon arrival, starting next week, according to an agreement signed between the two countries on Thursday. The locations are Athens, Thessaloniki as well as the islands of Crete and Carpo.\n\nThe tourists will be required to undergo a coronavirus test before boarding their flight in Israel and upon landing in Greece. The Israelis will be required to self-isolate until they receive the test results. They will not be required to quarantine upon their return in Israel. It was not yet known who will be asked to pay for the tests.\n\nIsraelis will not be able to visit the rest of the country because states in the European Union are not permitted to accept tourists from countries with a high coronavirus infection rate.\n\nGreek officials have agreed to the deal in principal on Wednesday, in a phone conversation between Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi and Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias. Dendias arrived in Israel early Thursday to finalize the details.\n\n\u201cThe decision expresses the warm relationship between the countries and the common desire to return to normal life in the coronavirus era,\u201d said Ashkenazi.\n\nAshkenazi said that he hopes more European countries will follow suit. The counterparts met at Ashkenazi\u2019s office in Yerushalayim.\n\nDendias is set to meet Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu later in the day to discuss the resumption of tourism and shared concerns over Turkey\u2019s energy exploration in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nTurkey and Greece, NATO allies, are vehemently at odds over overlapping claims for hydrocarbon resources in the region, and tensions have risen since Ankara launched exploration operations in a disputed area of the Mediterranean on Monday, in a move Greece called illegal.\n\nNetanyahu spoke with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis earlier in the summer regarding the opening of borders between the two countries, but the decision was held up as Israel entered its second wave of coronavirus and consequently delayed the original date of August 1.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Hamodia", "description": "Six hundred Israeli tourists a week will be allowed to visit four Greek locations without the need for mandatory quarantine upon arrival, starting next wee", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Greece Allows 600 Israelis a Week to Visit Four Greek Locations | Hamodia.com", "description": "Six hundred Israeli tourists a week will be allowed to visit four Greek locations without the need for mandatory quarantine upon arrival, starting next wee", "url": "https://hamodia.com/2020/08/13/greece-allows-600-israelis-week-visit-four-greek-locations/", "site_name": "Hamodia", "updated_time": "2020-08-13T09:22:55-04:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hamodia.com/hamod-uploads/2020/08/EfSw9MSXgAAUJRi-300x217.jpg", "secure_url": "https://images.hamodia.com/hamod-uploads/2020/08/EfSw9MSXgAAUJRi-300x217.jpg"}}, "article": {"section": "Coronavirus", "published_time": "2020-08-13T06:56:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T09:22:55-04:00"}}}}
