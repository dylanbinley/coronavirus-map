Curiously, an application by SPDC to join the Minister of Petroleum Resources to the suit for a just determination of the issues with all necessary parties was denied by the Judge who heard and determined the case within six weeks from when it was served on SPDC in July 2020. Under the Nigerian Petroleum Act, any acquisition or assignment of interests in a licence or lease must have the consent of the Minister of Petroleum Resources.\n\n\u201cThe root case, Chief Agbara and Others v. SPDC, which led to the purported sale of interests SPDC JV\u2019s assets is still the subject of ongoing proceedings in several courts, including the supreme court, and it remains the position of SPDC that no payment is due and any purported sale or enforcement of payment is premature and prejudicial to ongoing proceedings. The auction sale is also being challenged on appeal by SPDC.\n\n\u201cThe root case has its origin in a spill caused by third parties during the Nigerian Civil War, a challenging period which resulted in significant damage to oil and gas infrastructure in the Niger Delta region. While SPDC does not accept responsibility for the spill, the affected sites in Ejama Ebubu community were fully remediated, and this was certified by the government regulator.\n\n\u201cThe claim for N17billion as damages was first brought by the Ejama Ebubu community against SPDC in 2001 in the Federal High Court of Nigeria. In 2010, the court gave judgment against SPDC and awarded the claim without SPDC being given reasonable opportunity to defend the facts of the case. Indeed, this case has focused too long on procedural issues and not on its merits \u2013 we have always been clear that we are ready to defend this case based on the available facts.\n\n\u201cSPDC appealed the 2010 judgment and obtained an order to stay the execution of the judgment upon the provision of a bank guarantee issued by First Bank of Nigeria Limited in favour of the claimants. Despite this matter being the subject of ongoing proceedings in the Nigerian courts, the claimants went ahead to seek to enforce the judgment in both Nigeria and England.\n\n\u201cThe English court last year rejected the claimants\u2019 attempt to enforce the Nigerian court judgment in the UK, referring to a \u2018breach of natural justice\u2019 in the proceedings against Shell in Nigeria. The English court also found that the claimants had \u201cmaterially over-stated\u201d the value of the judgment which the claimants admitted was N34.716billion. The court therefore ruled that it would not be just and convenient for a Nigerian judgment to be enforced in the UK which the claimants acknowledge is \u201cmiscalculated\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOn Monday, March 2, 2020, the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja issued an order attaching the sum of N182billion in First Bank of Nigeria Limited\u2019s statutory account with the Central Bank of Nigeria in favour of Ejama Ebubu community in Rivers State.\n\n\u201cSPDC and other parties affected by the March 2, 2020 order of the Federal High Court filed separate appeals, as well as applied to set aside the order and restrain its execution pending the appeal decision. In accordance with the spirit of fair hearing in the Nigerian judicial system, we remain of the view that until the pending appeals are heard and determined, SPDC is not liable to make any payments, and therefore none any of its assets or interest should not be attached to satisfy the judgement.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) on Friday indicated that it would appeal the ruling of the Rivers State High Court...", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Shell appeals asset sale judgment in favour of Rivers", "description": "Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) on Friday indicated that it would appeal the ruling of the Rivers State High Court...", "url": "https://thenationonlineng.net/shell-appeals-asset-sale-judgment-in-favour-of-rivers/", "site_name": "Latest Nigeria News, Nigerian Newspapers, Politics", "image": {"identifier": "https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Shells-Company.jpeg", "width": 640, "height": 362}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenationng", "published_time": "2020-08-15T03:58:53+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 124339121242023}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@thenationnews", "site": "@thenationnews"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-Logo.jpg"}}}
