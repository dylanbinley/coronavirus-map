It\u2019s just the same as potentially as what may happen in school in September,\u201d said Dr. Anna Banerji, a paediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto.\n\nTo help prevent spread of the virus, Banerji encourages children to wear masks at school, including younger students if they feel comfortable.\n\nOn Thursday, Ontario Education Minister Stephen Lecce announced that school boards can access $500 million in reserve funds to help with the return to school during the pandemic.\n\nBanerji says she hopes the new access to funds will allow for more creative uses of spaces to keep children distanced, like auditoriums, community centres and stadiums.\n\nShe also recommends that parents perform symptoms checks on their children before school.\n\n\u201cIf they have fever, body ache, runny nose, cough, difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting diarrhea, rashes anything, shortness of breath, anything, they need to keep their kids at home,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite the positive case at the camp, some parents with kids in the program believe the experience could better prepare children for a safe return to school.\n\n\u201cMy daughter has to wear a mask at camp, she\u2019s doing the social distancing guidelines so I think it\u2019s really important she gets used to it now making September and school easier,\u201d said dad Dan Carroll.\n\nTo put the positive case into perspective, Mayor John Tory said there are 4,000 children currently enrolled in the city-run camps.\n\nWith files from the Canadian Press.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "News that a child has tested positive for COVID-19 at one of the city\u2019s CampTO summer camp locations has left parents bracing for possible outbreaks when school starts in September.", "keywords": "toronto news live, toronto, news, ctv news, breaking news, canadian, local news, weather, taffic, lotto, lottery, numbers, maple leafs, blue jays, gas prices, accident, murder, flood, fire, crash, attack, sex, crime, community, sports, advertising, ttc, strike, gta, brampton, mississauga, markham, richmond hill, vaughan, scarborough, durham region, covid 19 canada, covid 19, coronavirus canada, covid 19 ontario, ontario covid 19,", "news_keywords": "child, summer camp, COVID-19, COVID-19 Toronto, positive test, novel coronavirus, Barbara Frum Community Centre", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "fb": {"pages": 174761742563060}, "dc.date.modified": "2020-08-13", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Parents bracing for possible outbreak at schools in September after child tests positive at Toronto camp", "description": "News that a child has tested positive for COVID-19 at one of the city\u2019s CampTO summer camp locations has left parents bracing for possible outbreaks when school starts in September.", "url": "https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/parents-bracing-for-possible-outbreak-at-schools-in-september-after-child-tests-positive-at-toronto-camp-1.5062525", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.5062534.1597317522!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg", "site_name": "Toronto", "locale": "en_CA"}, "twitter": {"title": "Parents bracing for possible outbreak at schools in September after child tests positive at Toronto camp", "url": "https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/parents-bracing-for-possible-outbreak-at-schools-in-september-after-child-tests-positive-at-toronto-camp-1.5062525", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "News that a child has tested positive for COVID-19 at one of the city\u2019s CampTO summer camp locations has left parents bracing for possible outbreaks when school starts in September.", "site": "@CTVToronto", "creator": "@CTVToronto", "image": {"src": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.5062534.1597317522!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T07:19:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T18:35:00-04:00"}}}}
