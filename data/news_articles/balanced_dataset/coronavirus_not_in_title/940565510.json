Kamala Harris broke historic barriers in the ivory halls of Congress, and now on the Democratic presidential ticket, she dug into her heritage on Howard University\u2019s campus, one of the most prestigious historically Black colleges in the country.\n\n\u201cShe was well-steeped in her heritage both as a woman of Jamaican descent and a woman of South Asian descent,\u201d said Jill Louis, a Dallas-based corporate attorney, who attended Howard with Harris and is one of Harris\u2019 line sisters in Alpha Kappa Alpha, the historically Black sorority. \u201cShe would talk about what it was like to have that heritage and how she experienced it.\u201d\n\nUltimately, she said, Howard made students feel \u201ccomfortable in their Blackness and in understanding its expansiveness and to move and transcend as a human.\u201d And the campus was the springboard from youth to adulthood where Harris embraced her roots as both Black and Indian, on a path toward making history as she has done this week.\n\nHer selection as Joe Biden\u2019s running mate on Wednesday cemented Harris' place in American history and catalyzed discussions around race in the political sphere.\n\nSince the announcement was made, much of the focus has been on the fact that, if elected, Harris would become the first female, first Black and first Asian American vice president. It\u2019s a realization that has prompted talk about what her status as the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants would mean for the marginalized communities she represents and beyond.\n\nAdvocates say that Harris\u2019 multiracial background in an arena that's long been predominantly white has the potential to resonate with voters of color who have not seen themselves reflected in such a position of power.\n\nA multicultural background that shaped a politician\n\nHarris\u2019 mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who immigrated to the U.S. at 19 to pursue a doctorate in nutrition and endocrinology at the University of California, Berkeley, had an immense impact on her two daughters. Harris has spoken about how Gopalan, a civil rights activist, was a role model for her despite the challenges an Indian immigrant faced as a single mother, forging a life in the United States.\n\nKamala Harris with her mother, Shyamala, at a Chinese New Year parade in 2007. Kamala Harris campaign via AP\n\n\u201cMy mother, who raised me and my sister, was a proud woman,\u201d Harris said while on the campaign trail. \u201cShe was a brown woman. She was a woman with a heavy accent. She was a woman who, many times, people would overlook her or not take her seriously.\u201d\n\nGopalan met Harris\u2019 father, Donald, while participating in civil rights protests. They eventually divorced, with her raising the children on her own. Gopalan was cognizant that most people would see her children as Black and was \u201cdetermined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud Black women,\u201d Harris wrote in her autobiography, \u201cThe Truths We Hold.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gopalan also made efforts to nurture her children\u2019s Indian heritage, cooking traditional cuisine and bringing them on regular visits to India, where her father, P.V. Gopalan, a civil servant who died in 1998, would develop a deep connection with Harris. The senator described her grandfather as \u201creally one of my favorite people in my world.\u201d\n\nAs a young woman arriving at Howard University for freshman orientation in 1982, Harris recalled in her book looking around and thinking: \"This is heaven! ... Everyone looked like me.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019 college friend Sonya Lockett told NBC News in a phone interview that their Howard years were formative to them as young Black women.\n\n\u201cThere was just an activist streak that was happening all around us,\u201d Lockett said. \u201cWe stayed in the nation\u2019s capital, so we stayed in the center of political power for this country and we saw the politics, the lawmaking of the country, and we also saw all the people those laws affected.\u201d\n\nThe Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories.

And how can we make a difference? Where can we be most effective? How does this affect our community?\u201d she said.\n\nHarris ran for student council, pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first historically Black sorority, which was founded on Howard\u2019s campus, and chaired the economics society.\n\nHarris' background as coming from a family of trailblazers and being the daughter of immigrants has struck a chord with many Asian Americans, Varun Nikore, president of the AAPI Victory Fund, said.\n\n\u201cThe reason there is so much affinity to Kamala Harris is because her parents\u2019 story is a recent immigrant story,\u201d Nikore said. \u201cEspecially right now when immigrants are being vilified at every turn, Vice President Biden\u2019s pick is so poignant and reflects ideals of the greatness of America.\u201d\n\nAndra Gillespie, who teaches political science at Emory University in Atlanta, said that she doesn\u2019t see Harris as an anomaly given the rapidly changing demographics of the country. However, she said the country\u2019s history of race plays a large part in how she is perceived.\n\n\u201cHaving Black identity or Black heritage matters a lot in the United States and is how you get viewed,\u201d she said. \u201cShe reflects the diversity of America in the fact that Harris is biracial but nonwhite, and it also still shows ... how the fault line in America is still Black/non-Black.\u201d\n\nShe said Harris has also made certain signals on how she identifies herself \u2014 for instance, by attending a historically Black college and joining a Black sorority \u2014 but not necessarily to the exclusion of her South Asian identity.\n\nPost-Obama and after numerous examples of racism and police brutality against Black Americans recently, Gillespie said that having Harris on the ticket should mean that substantive issues for Black Americans are now seriously addressed.\n\n\u201cThe salience of racial issues and the racial toxicity of the Trump administration has made race much more important,\u201d she said.\n\nSupport from Asian and Black voters isn\u2019t guaranteed\n\nWhile it's not yet clear how Harris' prosecutorial background could affect the ticket, it was a thorn in her side when she ran for president in the Democratic primary, and her selection as the vice presidential nominee will certainly renew scrutiny of her past. She spent seven years as the district attorney in San Francisco, followed by six years as California's attorney general, and in both tenures she was criticized for her of marijuana convictions and for arresting the parents of truant students, who were mostly Black, among other issues. Particularly progressive and young Black voters will likely demand answers from Harris.\n\nStill, Black voters are reliably Democratic \u2014 89 percent of them voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, compared to 8 percent for Trump. A recent Washington Post-Ipsos poll found, however, that racism and police misconduct are the most pressing issues among registered Black voters. And despite Biden's lead over Trump among Black voters \u2014 92 percent to 5 percent \u2014 the poll found that about half \u201csupport Biden\u201d and the other half mainly \u201coppose Trump.\u201d\n\nWhile Harris is expected to be a boon for the ticket, she did struggle to gain traction among Black Democrats in her primary campaign. Gillespie said that may have had more to do with the high number of candidates in the race and with Black voters thinking \u201cstrategically\u201d rather than a general lack of interest in Harris\u2019 candidacy.\n\nHarris\u2019 new status as a vice presidential hopeful arrives against the backdrop of an Asian American electorate that\u2019s experiencing rapidly growing influence. In the past two decades, the group has ballooned by 139 percent, making it the fastest-growing demographic of eligible voters compared to all other major races and ethnicities. In comparison, the white electorate grew by 7 percent in the same period. Asian Americans also stand out as the only group composed of a majority of naturalized immigrants.\n\nIn recent elections, the Asian American and Pacific Islander population has trended left, with 79 percent voting for Clinton in 2016, according to an Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund exit poll conducted in 11 different Asian languages. South Asian Americans in particular voted most strongly Democrat with some subgroups like Pakistanis voting as high as 96 percent for Clinton. Indian Americans voted for the Democrat at 84 percent, a rate higher than the national average of the greater Asian American population, who voted for Clinton at 79 percent.\n\nHowever, support for Harris among Asian Americans has not been guaranteed. Data from 2018, just before Harris formally declared her presidential candidacy in January 2019 on Martin Luther King Day, shows that 52 percent of Indian Americans had a \u201cfavorable\u201d opinion of her. But another 20 percent had never heard of her. In interviews with several Indian Americans in February 2019, South Asian American leaders indicated that many in the community were likely unaware of Harris' Indian heritage.\n\n\u201cThey think of her as Black,\u201d said Annetta Seecharran, executive director of Chhaya Community Development Corp., an organization in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens that advocates for the housing needs of New York City\u2019s South Asian community.\n\nAnd though Harris did not hesitate to share anecdotes and stories from her childhood on the campaign trail, she rarely delved into issues of identity early on. Speaking to The Washington Post last year, Harris said she defined herself as simply \u201cAmerican,\u201d and said she generally did not struggle with issues surrounding her own identity.\n\n\u201cIt took Harris a little while during her presidential run to open up about her Indian American heritage and Asian American identity,\u201d Karthick Ramakrishnan, a public policy and political science professor at the University of California, Riverside, explained. \u201cPart of that might have been due to the harsh treatment that Barack Obama had gotten about his father\u2019s immigrant roots.\u201d\n\nDuring Obama\u2019s historic run for president in 2008, he was targeted by the birther movement, in which some critics, including Donald Trump, perpetuated the conspiracy theory that he was born in Kenya, where his father is from. And despite him being open about his Christian faith, Obama was also accused of being Muslim, oftentimes by Islamophobic groups.\n\nRamakrishnan added that Harris appeared to be warming up to talking more about her heritage last fall, and expects her to continue as the country moves toward the November election.\n\nRegardless of background, issues come first, advocates say\n\nLakshmi Sridaran, executive director of South Asian Americans Leading Together, a nonprofit civil rights group, emphasized that physical representation of the Asian American community is crucial, but it doesn\u2019t equal political representation. She said she hopes the Asian American electorate assesses Harris as a candidate based on policy, listing issues like COVID-19 relief legislation and policing among topics voters should dig further into.\n\n\u201cAs exciting as it is to have an Asian American and particularly a South Asian American in this role, what's important and what we encourage community members to do is assess her and engage her (and all candidates) on where she stands on issues that impact South Asians and to examine her voting record and policies,\" Sridaran said.", "METADATA": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613, "pages": 1508175089456029}, "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/black-asian-american-kamala-harris-identity-how-it-shaped-her-n1236563", "title": "Black, Asian, American: Kamala Harris\u2019 identity, how it shaped her and what it means for voters", "description": "Advocates say that Harris\u2019 multiracial background in an arena that's long been predominantly white, has the potential to resonate with voters of color who have not seen themselves reflected in such a position of power.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_33/3404064/200812-kamala-harris-howard-university-se-420p_d1f558b85968e35bae3a62c4c3648f14.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_33/3404064/200812-kamala-harris-howard-university-se-420p_d1f558b85968e35bae3a62c4c3648f14.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NBCNews", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_33/3404064/200812-kamala-harris-howard-university-se-420p_d1f558b85968e35bae3a62c4c3648f14.nbcnews-fp-1024-512.jpg", "title": "Black, Asian, American: Kamala Harris\u2019 identity, how it shaped her and what it means for voters", "description": "Advocates say that Harris\u2019 multiracial background in an arena that's long been predominantly white, has the potential to resonate with voters of color who have not seen themselves reflected in such a position of power.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Black, Asian, American: Understanding Kamala Harris\u2019 identity and how it shaped her", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_33/3404064/200812-kamala-harris-howard-university-se-420p_d1f558b85968e35bae3a62c4c3648f14.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "next-head-count": 88}}}
