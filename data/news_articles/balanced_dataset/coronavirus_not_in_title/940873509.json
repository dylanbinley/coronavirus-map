Canada has flattened the epidemic curve while the U.S. has more confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 than any other country.\n\nEssential cross-border workers like health care professionals, airline crews and truck drivers are still permitted to cross. Much of Canada\u2019s food supply comes from or via the U.S.\n\nAmericans who are returning to America and Canadians who are returning to Canada are also exempted from the border closure.", "METADATA": {"category": "news", "og": {"url": "https://www.10tv.com/article/news/nation-world/canada-us-border-restrictions-extended-to-at-least-sept/507-68023e30-0bc9-47d1-bd1e-3a64292c2c72", "title": "Canada US border restrictions extended to at least September", "description": "The statement by Public Safety Minister Bill Blair came a day after Mexico announced a similar measure for its border with the United States.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/76854f70-4426-479f-99bc-73d0290db2e2/76854f70-4426-479f-99bc-73d0290db2e2_1140x641.jpg", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "article": {"published_time": "8/14/2020 6:34:17 PM"}, "site_name": "10tv.com", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"title": "Canada US border restrictions extended to at least September", "image": {"src": "https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/76854f70-4426-479f-99bc-73d0290db2e2/76854f70-4426-479f-99bc-73d0290db2e2_360x203.jpg"}, "card": "summary", "site": "10TV", "description": "The statement by Public Safety Minister Bill Blair came a day after Mexico announced a similar measure for its border with the United States.", "domain": "www.10tv.com"}, "viewport": "width=1170", "site": "10tv.com", "description": "The statement by Public Safety Minister Bill Blair came a day after Mexico announced a similar measure for its border with the United States.", "fb": {"app_id": 688432451896200}}}}
