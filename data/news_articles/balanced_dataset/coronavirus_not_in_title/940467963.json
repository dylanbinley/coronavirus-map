He still suffers occasionally, but he\u2019s come an incredibly long way from the cat I took home.\n\n\"He grew to trust and love us which makes him part of the family. He\u2019s always the first one there if I\u2019m upset, rubbing his head on mine to let me know it\u2019ll be okay. We help each other and that\u2019s why he\u2019s so special.\"\n\nThe 11-year-old moggy has still given her a scare or two.\n\nHis insatiable curiosity led to an unplanned trip to Birmingham after he hopped in the back of a workman\u2019s van while Rebecca was moving from Oxfordshire to Swindon.\n\nShe thinks he saw boxes being loaded into vans for the move and got in the workman's van by mistake, wasn't spotted and ended up locked in.\n\nLuckily he was chipped and her frantic search ended when she had a call from a vet to tell her where he was.\n\n\"It hasn\u2019t put him off though, he still often runs out and tries to get in the van when we have a food delivery from the supermarket,\" she said.\n\nBuddy the Frug (French bulldog x pug) arrived in Katie Lewis\u2019s home via a food bank she ran. She was fostering him, but she fell in love with him and he stayed.\n\nHe caused great hilarity after his neutering operation when his \u2018cone of shame\u2019 kept getting stuck on obstacles.\n\nYoung Cooper Gibson here is a very intelligent lad. A prolific sock and towel thief he loves to play fetch. Owner Robert says no matter how bad the day has been he always lifts people\u2019s spirits when they get home.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "OMG-Verify-V1": "4389-366acdfc-5224-4c07-bb70-f74d8fbfc2db", "og": {"url": "https://www.wiltshiretimes.co.uk/news/18647864.pet-week-cat-set-fire-hit-car-finds-loving-home/", "site_name": "Wiltshire Times", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.wiltshiretimes.co.uk/resources/images/11690241/", "width": 1200, "height": 1600}, "title": "PET OF THE WEEK: Cat set on fire and hit by car finds loving home", "type": "website", "name": "PET OF THE WEEK: Cat set on fire and hit by car finds loving home", "description": "A cat who survived being set on fire and hit by a car as he tried to escape the torment is one of our Pet of the Week stars."}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.wiltshiretimes.co.uk/resources/images/11690241/"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "PET OF THE WEEK: Cat set on fire and hit by car finds loving home", "description": "A cat who survived being set on fire and hit by a car as he tried to escape the torment is one of our Pet of the Week stars."}, "fb": {"app_id": 130067583730996}, "medium": "news", "title": "PET OF THE WEEK: Cat set on fire and hit by car finds loving home", "description": "A cat who survived being set on fire and hit by a car as he tried to escape the torment is one of our Pet of the Week stars."}}}
