(KOLN) -Scammers aren\u2019t letting the Coronavirus stand in their way; they\u2019re still trying to take your money. A more recent scam, called the lottery or sweepstakes scam, resulted in $162 million of loss just last year.\n\nFor Ben Wiehe, it just seemed too good to be true. An Instagram account giving away free money. He was hesitant at first, studying the page before he decided to ask if he could win some of that \u201cfree money.\u201d\n\nIt was the direct message that started it all. Wiehe, a college student, was asking for financial help.\n\n\u201cI was like hey, I\u2019m a college student, I have student loan debt, want to help me out?\u201d said Wiehe. \u201cHe replied and said we can send you $15,000, and I said, what $15,000 that\u2019s crazy!\u201d\n\nBut after that online exchange, things started to feel a little fishy. The account asked him to send hundreds of dollars to pay for the shipping and handling of his \u201cfree money.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe gave me a bunch of reasons for it and I said, well I don\u2019t have $200, I can only send you $100,\u201d said Wiehe.\n\n$200 later, the money Ben was promised never came.\n\n\u201cI had red flags coming at me the whole time with that thought in my head, like don\u2019t get your hopes too up,\u201d said Wiehe.\n\nHe reported it to the Better Business Bureau. Ben, and thousands of other Americans, have lost money to a lottery or sweepstakes scam.\n\n\u201cSeniors do prominently be victimized by this but it can affect all ages,\u201d said Tami Barrett of the Better Business Bureau. \u201cNone of us are not attacked by this, not targeted by this. It comes at all socioeconomic levels.\u201d\n\nAccording to the BBB, It\u2019s a recent scam out of Jamaica. It netted $452 million in losses, especially from older adults, since 2017.\n\n\u201cIf you get on the phone with these people, they are so tactful, so deceptive, they can really lure you into believing something that\u2019s just not true,\u201d said Barrett.\n\nAcross the country there have been over 4,000 reports to the BBB about lottery or sweepstakes scams.\n\nThey said the best way to avoid these scams is to remember these tips:\n\nYou must play to win, keep all your receipts and files\n\nDon\u2019t wire money to anybody.\n\nCheck with your State Lottery Agency.\n\nDo an internet search of the company, name or phone number of the person trying to send you money.\n\nYou can report them at bbb.org/scamtracker ; ftc.gov; or ic3.gov\n\nBen said since all of this happened, he\u2019s been working hard to help his friends identify scams before it\u2019s too late. He said he\u2019s just grateful things didn\u2019t get worse.\n\nCopyright 2020 KOLN.
