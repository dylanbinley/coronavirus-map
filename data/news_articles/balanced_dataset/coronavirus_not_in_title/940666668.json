Do you think a court or anyone in Australia would award someone $30bn? It\u2019s just an excuse so Mark McGowan can cover up \u2026\u201d\n\nHe said the WA government\u2019s actions had undermined his rights and the justice system.\n\n\u201cThey have eliminated my rights to appeal to a court and eliminated national justice and said at the end of the day if they\u2019ve done something wrong, Mark McGowan or his attorney general, and there\u2019s an order ever against them I have to pay for it,\u201d he said.\n\nPalmer earlier told Perth radio he wanted McGowan jailed and compared his government to Nazi Germany.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate story that I want out there is jailing of Mark McGowan for what he\u2019s been doing to Western Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you go back to Nazi Germany, their law was gradually eroded over seven years.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s actions in passing last night\u2019s legislation have been labelled \u201cunprecedented\u201d by experts. The new law \u2013 which Palmer has said he will challenge \u2013 invalidates the arbitration agreements between the mining magnate and the state, terminates the ongoing arbitration, removes any existing arbitral awards and stymies further legal proceedings or appeals.\n\nLorraine Finlay, a law lecturer and constitutional expert with Murdoch University, said the government was effectively trying to legislate its way out of a legal dispute.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that having to pay a potential $30bn damages claim would be devastating for WA,\u201d Finlay wrote in the Conversation. \u201cBut trying to circumvent the courts by instead legislating a preferred outcome is also not without its consequences.\u201d\n\nFinlay said the government\u2019s actions undermined founding principles of the rule of law and separation of powers.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of concerns with the government\u2019s actions. First, this approach undermines both the rule of law and separation of powers, which are foundational pillars of our Westminster system of government,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt also creates sovereign risk. The premier has sought to downplay this by reassuring the resources sector this is a one-time-only exceptional case.\u201d\n\nThe state government leader in the upper house, Sue Ellery, said the injunction, which also seeks further damages and costs, was doomed to fail.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that it will not succeed,\u201d she told parliament. \u201cI\u2019m told the action has never been taken in Australia before.\u201d\n\nLate on Thursday the legislative council approved unprecedented legislation to amend a 2002 state agreement with Palmer\u2019s Mineralogy company.\n\nIt was intended to have the effect of terminating arbitration between the two parties and stopping Palmer seeking damages against the state.\n\nScott Morrison asks Clive Palmer to drop court challenge to WA border closure Read more\n\nPalmer earlier claimed a victory over the McGowan government, revealing the Queensland supreme court had formally registered his two arbitration awards.\n\nHe said this meant WA\u2019s \u201cdraconian and disgraceful\u201d legislation would now be invalid under the constitution.\n\nThe attorney general, John Quigley, has previously said any court action between the bill\u2019s introduction and assent would be covered by the legislation, which was fast-tracked through parliament with the support of the WA Nationals and Greens.\n\nThe Liberal opposition and some crossbenchers had unsuccessfully sought more time to scrutinise the legislation.\n\nLiberal MP Nick Goiran labelled the process a \u201cpathetic charade for democracy\u201d.\n\nPalmer and his associated companies Mineralogy and International Minerals are pursuing damages over a 2012 decision by the former Liberal government not to assess his proposed Balmoral South iron ore mine in the Pilbara.\n\nThe government has calculated the total claim to be $27.7bn minus costs, an amount premier Mark McGowan said would cripple the state.\n\nPalmer is also challenging WA\u2019s borders in the high court, but it emerged this week he had offered to withdraw the bid if officials agreed to move arbitration hearings relating to the damages claim from Perth to Canberra.", "METADATA":
