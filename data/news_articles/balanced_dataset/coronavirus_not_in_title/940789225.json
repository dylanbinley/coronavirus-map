We with the Minnesota Peace Project call on our Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith to lead the effort in the Senate for a joint congressional resolution to invoke the War Powers Act to end U.S. support of the Saudi war on Yemen. We also call on them to oppose any arms sales to Saudi Arabia.\n\nFinally, we urge our senators to demand that the Trump administration restore USAID humanitarian funding to Yemen.\n\nNina Preheim\n\nDuluth\n\nThe writer is with the Minnesota Peace Project (minnesotapeaceproject.org).", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "We are now in the sixth year of the Saudi-led war on Yemen.
