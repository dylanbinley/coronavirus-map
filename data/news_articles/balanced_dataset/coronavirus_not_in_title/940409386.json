Police have detained around 6000 people.\n\nAbout 200 women march in solidarity with protesters injured in the latest rallies against the results of the country's presidential election in Minsk, Belarus. Credit:AP\n\nLukashenko has sought better relations with the West amid strained relations with traditional ally Russia. Brussels lifted sanctions, imposed over Lukashenko's human rights record, in 2016, but will weigh new measures this week.\n\nLithuania, Poland and Latvia jointly offered to mediate between Lukashenko and the protesters, and threatened sanctions at a European or national level if the offer was declined.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "theme-color": "#0A1633", "title": "Thousands stage flower protest in Belarus, EU weighs sanctions", "description": "In the city of Brest, police fired live rounds after some protesters it said were armed with metal bars ignored warning shots fired in the air.", "article": {"section": "Europe", "published_time": "2020-08-12T21:06:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T13:47:32+00:00"}, "pubdate": "2020-08-12T21:06:22+00:00", "author": "Andrei Makhovsky", "fb": {"app_id": 230318243699378, "pages": 492499720777787}, "og": {"description": "In the city of Brest, police fired live rounds after some protesters it said were armed with metal bars ignored warning shots fired in the air.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6066472114137483%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_450%2C$y_218/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_theage_no_age_social_wm/fa67e2d1874326c4f1c55950f8d4f6c3de3b2583", "width": 800, "height": 450, "secure_url": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6066472114137483%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_450%2C$y_218/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_theage_no_age_social_wm/fa67e2d1874326c4f1c55950f8d4f6c3de3b2583"}, "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Age", "title": "Thousands stage flower protest in Belarus, EU weighs sanctions", "url": "https://www.theage.com.au/world/europe/thousands-stage-flower-protest-in-belarus-as-eu-weighs-sanctions-20200813-p55l7h.html"}, "parsely-title": "Thousands stage flower protest in Belarus, EU weighs sanctions", "parsely-link": "https://www.theage.com.au/world/europe/thousands-stage-flower-protest-in-belarus-as-eu-weighs-sanctions-20200813-p55l7h.html", "parsely-type": "NewsArticle", "parsely-image-url": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6066472114137483%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_450%2C$y_218/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_theage_no_age_social_wm/fa67e2d1874326c4f1c55950f8d4f6c3de3b2583", "parsely-section": "Europe", "parsely-author": "Andrei Makhovsky", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-08-12T21:06:22+00:00", "parsely-tags": "PROTEST", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"article\",\"assetId\":\"p55l7h\"}", "parsely-network-canonical": "https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/thousands-stage-flower-protest-in-belarus-as-eu-weighs-sanctions-20200813-p55l7h.html", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,index", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "In the city of Brest, police fired live rounds after some protesters it said were armed with metal bars ignored warning shots fired in the air.", "image": {"src": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6066472114137483%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_450%2C$y_218/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_theage_no_age_social_wm/fa67e2d1874326c4f1c55950f8d4f6c3de3b2583"}, "site": "@theage", "title": "Thousands stage flower protest in Belarus, EU weighs sanctions"}, "google-signin-client_id": "589384154045-p5vk6p2adh6l4p13n8rfjtbsfqu8gbn5.apps.googleusercontent.com"}}}
