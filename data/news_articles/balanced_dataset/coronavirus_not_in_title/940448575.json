The official promised to consider the request,\u201d said an airport official.\n\nOn Wednesday, a state government official said they were considering the request and that they were going through the SOPs before deciding whether international evacuation flights could be allowed.\n\n\u201cIf the state government wants to impose stricter SOPs, we will accept that. The airlines that can meet the SOP demands will operate evacuation flights and others will not,\u201d a representative of the airline operators committee at the Calcutta airport said.\n\nThe state government, while allowing chartered flights from abroad, announced that only those who would test negative for Covid-19 within 96 hours before departure would be allowed to board the aircraft. The agency hiring a chartered flight will have to ensure that all passengers follow the SOPs.\n\nEvacuation flights, operated by airlines, will have individual passengers booking tickets.\n\nThe government had stopped such flights in July after hundreds of evacuees, many of them medical students, had refused institutional quarantine and gone home straight from the city airport.\n\nThe Telegraph reported on Wednesday that travel agents\u2019 federations had written to the state government urging it to allow evacuation flights. The airline operators\u2019 committee made a similar appeal to the government during the day.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the state government\u2019s move to allow chartered flights. Now, if the evacuation flights are allowed, many who can\u2019t afford to buy a seat on such chartered flights can get a chance to return home,\u201d said Anil Punjabi, chairman, east, Travel Agents Federation of India.\n\nThe tour operators and airlines have also requested the state to allow resumption of domestic flights from six cities with high Covid prevalence to Calcutta. All flights to Calcutta from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune and Nagpur had been banned on July 6 following a request from the state government.\n\nThe ban was to end on August 15 but has been extended till August 31.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "description": "The government had stopped such flights in July after hundreds of evacuees, many of them medical students, had refused institutional quarantine", "fb": {"app_id": 534248160342700}, "keyword": "Calcutta Airport, West Bengal government, Evacuation, coronavirus", "og": {"url": "https://www.telegraphindia.com/calcutta/coronavirus-outbreak-bengal-to-consider-evacuation-flights-plea/cid/1789007", "title": "State to \u2018consider\u2019 evacuation flights plea", "type": "website", "description": "The government had stopped such flights in July after hundreds of evacuees, many of them medical students, had refused institutional quarantine", "image": "https://assets.telegraphindia.com/telegraph/2020/Jul/1595623291_1595364351_airportt.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.telegraphindia.com/calcutta/coronavirus-outbreak-bengal-to-consider-evacuation-flights-plea/cid/1789007", "site": "@ttindia", "creator": "@ttindia", "title": "State to \u2018consider\u2019 evacuation flights plea", "description": "The government had stopped such flights in July after hundreds of evacuees, many of them medical students, had refused institutional quarantine"}, "robots": "index, follow", "google-site-verification": "VRsNukuvRBQE0QCvqNj2fdezMC2N6_pAK2B7lMHcHGA", "referrer": "origin", "msvalidate.01": "16C1B4A8FD9A29E3D5AFC3EF251C77A8"}}}
