Harris is the junior senator from California and the state\u2019s former attorney general. She\u2019s the first Black woman and the first Asian American on a major party\u2019s presidential ticket. If Biden wins, Harris would become the 2024 front-runner; she\u2019s the future of the Democratic Party. But her selection reads more like an epilogue.\n\nThe earliest coronavirus lockdowns in the spring truncated the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. Former vice president Biden beat Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, but both men disappeared from the public view, and President Donald Trump once again dominated the presidential context. For the past few months, Biden has campaigned from the comfort of his home in Wilmington, Delaware, limiting his public appearances and thus limiting his exposure to (a) the coronavirus and (b) Trump. Biden has overtaken Trump in the general election polls. He\u2019s co-opted Sanders into his campaign materials while nonetheless demoralizing Sanders\u2019s hard-core supporters. He\u2019s recruited Harris onto the ticket despite absorbing a kidney shot from Harris in one of last year\u2019s debates. He\u2019s restored some semblance of stability and fraternity in his party\u2019s presidential politics. But he\u2019s done so by side-stepping core tensions that persist among Democrats: leftists vs. liberals, millennials vs. boomers, feminists vs. patriarchs. Harris side-steps these tensions, too. She embraced \u201cMedicare for All\u201d as a candidate. She disparaged it as a candidate. She has a little something for everyone.\n\n\n\nDuring the primaries, Biden pledged to pick a woman as his running mate; South Carolina Representative Jim Clyburn urged him to pick a Black woman. Biden pitched this potential partnership as a sort of concession to younger progressives, and to women in general, who might like to see a future for women in presidential politics beyond Hillary Clinton. At age 77, Biden can claim his party\u2019s presidential nomination, but he cannot claim his party\u2019s future\u2014hence the utmost urgency in this year\u2019s vice presidential speculation, enlivened by the common concerns about Biden\u2019s advanced age. Trump has gone so far as to suggest that Biden\u2019s running mate will be \u201cthe real president\u201d if Biden wins. The vice presidency transformed Joe Biden from a two-time also-ran into a durable presidential front-runner and an inheritor of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential legacy. Notably, Harris suspended her own presidential campaign a couple of months before the Iowa caucuses. She underperformed, making her Biden\u2019s ideal campaign understudy.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to read the future of the Democratic Party into Biden. He\u2019s too old, and, unlike Sanders, he seems too indifferent to the young activists who will inherit his party. He\u2019s an interstitial politician, and Trump\u2019s talking point against him rings true: Biden could ascend to the presidency in his late 70s and, essentially, have no future in politics beyond his presidential term. Trump is three years younger than Biden but much more vivid and provocative in his ideological implications for his own party; Biden is opaque and limited in his mission to defeat Trump. Though Biden reportedly vetted other candidates, such as Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and California Representative Karen Bass, he seemed to prefer candidates with minimal ideological differentiation from him: Harris, activist and former Georgia state representative Stacey Abrams, Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth, and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2014each of them loyal, conventional Democrats who reinforce Biden\u2019s pragmatism. Biden always seemed likeliest to settle on Harris. He owes his resurgence against Sanders to Black voters, and, in some sense, he\u2019s settling his tab.\n\nBut he\u2019s side-stepping some profound tensions. In the months since Biden vanquished Sanders, young progressives have spilled into the streets in record numbers, campaigning for police abolition and other criminal justice reforms. For better or worse, Biden and Harris have little, if anything, to do with these progressives. Harris and Biden\u2019s political partnership contains a more modest outlook on racial reconciliation and feminist advancement in the Democratic Party. Twelve years ago, Obama named Biden as his running mate in part to relieve some anxieties about the young Black senator who would become the first Black president. Four years ago, Trump selected Mike Pence to mitigate the common doubts about Trump\u2019s social conservative bona fides. There\u2019s a certain whimsy in the transactional logic for vice presidential selection. In Harris, Biden finds his understudy. But neither Biden nor Harris seems prepared to defuse the more explosive tensions in the Democratic Party.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Ringer", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ringer/", "published_time": "2020-08-12T13:05:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-12T13:05:54-04:00"}, "author": "Justin Charity", "style-tools": "https://www.theringer.com/style/community/723/5eb4b5d435466d20eeaac4a72df57099/tools.css", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "description": "Biden selected the California senator as his running mate.
