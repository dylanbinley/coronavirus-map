With the accredited embassy in Kuwait, the government enrolled the services of a local Lebanese lawyer to act as an honorary consul.\n\n\"The consulate is ready and willing to give ETC and process clearance of the documents through the immigration department and negotiate waiver of immigration penalties once they comply with the protocol required,\" the embassy said.", "METADATA": {"description": "Kenyans stranded in Lebanon will have to wait until their immigration status is determined, Kenyan officials said Wednesday.", "google-site-verification": "bGxG4qeN9up-gMXKjsgylykqjVrzxLjg1rQrP3K-rJk", "keywords": "Africa, news, politics, economy, trade, business, sports, current events, travel, Kenya, External Relations, East Africa, Middle East and Africa, Migration", "msvalidate.01": "72401C28AAAC95E8D3FF1881A90F2C4D", "robots": "noarchive", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Kenyans stranded in Lebanon will have to wait until their immigration status is determined, Kenyan officials said Wednesday.", "image": "https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png", "site": "@allafrica", "title": "Kenyans Stranded in Lebanon Urged to Get Travel Documents"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "article": {"modified_time": "2020-08-13T08:23:45+0000", "published_time": "2020-08-13T08:06:03+0000", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/allAfricacom/98946450029", "section": "News", "tag": "Migration"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100369188719, "pages": 98946450029}, "og": {"description": "Kenyans stranded in Lebanon will have to wait until their immigration status is determined, Kenyan officials said Wednesday.", "image": "https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png", "site_name": "allAfrica.com", "title": "Kenyans Stranded in Lebanon Urged to Get Travel Documents", "type": "article", "url": "https://allafrica.com/stories/202008130240.html"}}}}
