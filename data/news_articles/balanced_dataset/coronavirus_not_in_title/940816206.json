Many of our girls will now go off to university to continue their studies.\n\nYou may also want to watch:\n\n\u201cI am, however, equally concerned for some of the students who appear to have been downgraded by the exam boards, being awarded grades much lower than those awarded by their teachers.\n\n\u201cWe do have some anomalies that will require investigation to ensure that these students have not been incorrectly penalised.\u201d\n\nAmong the high performers at the school were Angelica Dunkley, who received As in biology and art, and a B in chemistry and Beatriz Gasper, who earned an A in Italian, B in Portuguese, and D*s in business studies and health & social Care.\n\nBeatriz said: \u201cWhen I received the acceptance email this morning I was beyond happy I had to rush to school to confirm the news and it\u2019s such a good feeling when all the hard work and the study hours have paid off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rewarding and motivating to see our results and infinite support from all teachers. An amazing and meaningful experience, I couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d\n\nMore than half the pupils at JFS school in The Mall, Kenton were awarded A*-A (51.5 percent) with 33pc awarded just those top marks.\n\nAnother 77.3pc of A*-B grades were awarded from a cohort of 241 students.\n\nFourteen students are off to Oxbridge colleges and six others accepted to medical school.\n\nRachel Fink, headteacher, added: \u201cWe commend all our students who have coped superbly with the huge uncertainties as a result of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cOur staff have shown huge commitment to our students and have demonstrated that they know them well.\n\n\u201cEvery JFS student is so much more than a national statistic and we wish each and every one of them much continued success.\u201d\n\nKingsbury High School also reported high performances.\n\nMichael Senior, director of Sixth Form said: \u201cWith A Level exams cancelled this year, students were anxious about their school\u2019s estimated grades and how they might be changed by exam boards.\n\n\u201cWith a cohort of more than 200 Year 13s, 95 percent managed to get places to university with many receiving their first choice.\n\n\u201cStudents were much relieved.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "twitter": {"card": "photo"}, "title": "A Level results 2020: Brent schools ready to investigate and appeal any downgrades", "DC.title": "A Level results 2020: Brent schools ready to investigate and appeal any downgrades", "og": {"title": "A Level results 2020: Brent schools ready to investigate and appeal any downgrades", "description": "Students across Brent opened their A Level results on Thursday with mixed emotions as they and their UK peers are the first cohort never to have sat them.", "type": "article", "image": "https://www.kilburntimes.co.uk/polopoly_fs/1.6793213!/image/image.jpg", "url": "https://www.kilburntimes.co.uk/news/education/a-level-exam-results/a-level-results-2020-brent-schools-report-good-grades-1-6793215", "site_name": "Kilburn Times"}, "author": "Nathalie Raffray", "DC.creator": "Nathalie Raffray", "keywords": "A Level, A Level Results 2020", "DC.subject": "A Level, A Level Results 2020", "fb": {"pages": 1207189302684253}, "description": "Students across Brent opened their A Level results on Thursday with mixed emotions as they and their UK peers are the first cohort never to have sat them.", "robots": "max-video-preview:-1", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "google-site-verification": "Nm7pOpxVTDgFBPSibDT98fJ9LLL2JyrAakq6ROcg8K8", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}}}
