The aviation secretary informed the committee that a person can become a commercial pilot by passing A-level or intermediate and attending commercial pilot course.\n\nHe told the committee that a total of 262 pilots were grounded on suspicion of having dubious licenses. The licenses of 28 pilots were revoked and 193 pilots were suspended. 38 pilots had been issued licenses under similar names which are being checked. 54 pilots had not sat the exam, he said\n\nAccording to the secretary, now only those pilots are flying PIA aircraft who have verified licenses.\n\n\u201cThe FIA [Federal Investigation Agency] is investigating the fake license case. Five officers belonging to license branch have been suspended. They have been issued show cause notices and their role is being probed,\u201d he added.\n\nThe committee chairman, however, said the real culprits were still on job. \u201cIt is better that NAB [National Accountability Bureau] starts an inquiry into this matter,\u201d he added.\n\nPIA Chief Executive Officer Air Marshal Arshad Malik told the committee that the airline is going to file an appeal against the ban imposed by the European Air Safety Agency (Easa) before August 28.\n\nThe committee also discussed alleged corruption in the construction of new Islamabad airport and directed NAB to complete its probe at the earliest.\n\nThe aviation minister said the Islamabad airport was poorly planned and substandard material was used in its construction. \u201cThis airport is in my constituency, and aviation is also my ministry. We are also ready to conduct a forensic audit of this airport,\u201d he said.\n\nBriefing the committee, the airport\u2019s project director \u2013 Asif Ali Shah Gilani \u2013 said the prime minister has constituted a cabinet committee on the New Islamabad Airport which investigating into all these issues.\n\n\u201cIt is not a single project but it contains numerous packages undertaken by various contractors. These packages are being investigated separately by NAB, the FIA and other agencies.\n\n\u201cA committee, comprising the Supreme Court and high court judges is also looking into arbitration. The recommendations of the cabinet committee will be sent to the federal cabinet. However, a JIT [joint investigation team] cannot be formed on this issue,\u201d he added.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "ahrefs-site-verification": "80d91b866834629ca6d4329f97e56e8b3e664a02379ef1426de12c9cf7ce2c34", "fb": {"admins": 503171569, "app_id": 278477199157577, "pages": 111457038871331}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@etribune", "title": "Crashed plane\u2019s pilots had valid licenses: committee told", "description": "Senate panel asks NAB to expedite probe into alleged corruption in construction of Islamabad airport", "image": {"src": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/2231902-piaplanecrashreuters-1590851108/2231902-piaplanecrashreuters-1590851108.jpg"}}, "robots": "noodp", "csrf-token": "R0AQdJN9AP2b8260mQl0GApT7ewqc3xWOAuQVoIt", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "url": "http://tribune.com.pk/story/2259568/crashed-planes-pilots-had-valid-licenses-committee-told", "site_name": "The Express Tribune", "type": "article", "title": "Crashed plane\u2019s pilots had valid licenses: committee told | The Express Tribune", "description": "Senate panel asks NAB to expedite probe into alleged corruption in construction of Islamabad airport", "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/2231902-piaplanecrashreuters-1590851108/2231902-piaplanecrashreuters-1590851108.jpg"}, "description": "Senate panel asks NAB to expedite probe into alleged corruption in construction of Islamabad airport", "title": "Crashed plane\u2019s pilots had valid licenses: committee told", "article": {"publisher": "https://tribune.com.pk", "author": "https://tribune.com.pk/author/398", "section": "Pakistan", "published_time": "2020-08-14T19:42:09+00:00"}}}}
