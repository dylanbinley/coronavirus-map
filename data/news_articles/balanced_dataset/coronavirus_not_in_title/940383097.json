Each time, we analyse the file with all the technical data. The applications are submitted with the justifications,\u201d mines minister Willy Kitobo told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThese mining companies and the processors interested in purchasing these concentrates have been invited to Kinshasa on (August) 20th to see what can be done.\u201d\n\nIn January, China\u2019s state-owned mining company CNMC launched Congo\u2019s first large-scale smelter, the Lualaba Copper Smelter (LCS).\n\nThe government joint venture is capable of processing 400,000 tonnes of copper concentrate and producing around 120,000 tonnes of copper blister per year.\n\nBut even at full capacity, the LCS cannot process all Congo\u2019s copper production. Congo produced 765,000 tonnes of copper concentrate in the first half of the year alone, the central bank said, up 13.4% year-on-year.\n\n\u201cOur initial take is that they\u2019ll fill Lualaba\u2019s capacity and then issue waivers for the rest,\u201d said Indigo Ellis, head of Africa research at Verisk Maplecroft, a risk analytics company.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not a sustainable option, the harm that it\u2019ll cause for the industry and investment environment is negative.\u201d\n\nCongo Chamber of Mines president Louis Watum said he understands the government wants to boost beneficiation in-country, because of the revenue it generates, but said most mining companies cannot smelt in Congo because of inadequate electricity supply.", "METADATA": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "GCA-Commodities", "DCSext.ChannelList": "companies-mtal;everythingNews;GCA-Commodities;africa-news", "description": "Mining companies and copper and cobalt buyers have been invited to a meeting in Kinshasa next week to discuss if there is a way to maintain waivers to an export ban that are meant to expire in September, the mining minister said on Thursday.", "Author": "Hereward Holland", "keywords": "US,CONGO,MINING,Copper,Congo (DRC),Mining,Metals and Mining (TRBC),International Trade,Cobalt,Base Metals,Africa", "news_keywords": "US;CONGO;MINING;Copper;Congo (DRC);Mining;Metals and Mining (TRBC);International Trade;Cobalt;Base Metals;Africa", "REVISION_DATE": "Wed Aug 12 17:35:54 UTC 2020", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2020-08-12T17:35:54+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Hereward Holland", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-mining-idUSKCN2582G1", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Congo to meet miners to debate copper concentrate export waivers", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,CONGO,MINING,Copper,Congo (DRC),Mining,Metals and Mining (TRBC),International Trade,Cobalt,Base Metals,Africa", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-CONGO-MINING", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Congo to meet miners to debate copper concentrate export waivers", "sailthru.author": "Hereward Holland", "sailthru.date": "2020-08-12T17:35:54+0000", "sailthru.title": "Congo to meet miners to debate copper concentrate export waivers", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Congo to meet miners to debate copper concentrate export waivers", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-mining-idUSKCN2582G1", "type": "article", "description": "Mining companies and copper and cobalt buyers have been invited to a meeting in Kinshasa next week to discuss if there is a way to maintain waivers to an export ban that are meant to expire in September, the mining minister said on Thursday.", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-12T17:35:54+0000", "modified_time": "2020-08-12T17:35:54+0000", "section": "Business", "author": "Hereward Holland", "tag": "US,CONGO,MINING,Copper,Congo (DRC),Mining,Metals and Mining (TRBC),International Trade,Cobalt,Base Metals,Africa"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Congo to meet miners to debate copper concentrate export waivers", "description": "Mining companies and copper and cobalt buyers have been invited to a meeting in Kinshasa next week to discuss if there is a way to maintain waivers to an export ban that are meant to expire in September, the mining minister said on Thursday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/business/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Business - Metals and Mining", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Business", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Metals and Mining", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}}}
