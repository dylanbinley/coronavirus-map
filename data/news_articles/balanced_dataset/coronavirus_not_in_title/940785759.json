If Greece continues to attack Oru\u00e7 Reis, we will retaliate in kind,\u201d President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan told reporters in Istanbul on Aug. 14.\n\nThe ties between Turkey and Greece have become tense once again due to overlapping claims over the continental shelf in the eastern Mediterranean where Turkey is carrying out seismic works by the Oru\u00e7 Reis survey ship accompanied by the Turkish warships.\n\nAn incident between the Turkish frigate Kemal Reis and the Greek frigate Limnos occurred two days ago with Turkey describing it as \u201cprovocation\u201d by Greece while Greece called it \u201can accident\u201d as a result of a \u201cmini collision.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn incident like that happened yesterday and the Kemal Reis gave the necessary response. They will be retaliated in kind if attacks continue,\u201d Erdo\u011fan stated.\n\nIn Bern, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu also raised the incident at a press conference with Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis on Aug. 14.\n\n\u201cGreece should act in common sense. It should avoid attempts to harass our Oru\u00e7 Reis ship, the way it did two days ago,\u201d he said.\n\nA Greek defense ministry official characterized the incident as an accident and a mini collision be-tween the Turkish and Greek frigates with no major harm on the two sides, according to Reuters.\n\n[HH] Oru\u00e7 Reis to stay in the Mediterranean until Aug. 23\n\nErdo\u011fan reiterated that Turkey\u2019s policy is based on resolving the regional problems through dialogue and informed about his phone conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Council President Charles Michel late on Aug. 13.\n\nHe said Turkey agreed with Merkel\u2019s suggestion of the continuation of dialogue between the parties after Aug. 23 as the Oru\u00e7 Reis will end its seismic works in the Mediterranean and de-escalation in the region. \u201cI hope Ms. Merkel could bring [Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos] Mr. Mitsotakis to the same line during her phone conversation,\u201d Erdo\u011fan stated.\n\nGreece should abide by the international law but its practices in the Western Thrace against the Turkish minority groups are not encouraging, Erdo\u011fan said, emphasizing that Turkey will do whatever necessary to protect its kinship.\n\n\u201cThese are therefore not positive signals [from Greece],\u201d he stated.\n\nTurkish, Egyptian spy agencies in dialogue\n\nOn a question, President Erdo\u011fan criticized Egypt for signing a maritime demarcation agreement with Greece, referring a blueprint linked between Athens and Cairo on Aug. 6.\n\nInforming that Egypt has approached Turkey via its intelligence agency to underline that there are some misunderstandings concerning the agreement that Cairo signed with Athens, Erdo\u011fan stressed that talks between the two agencies will continue in order to clarify the misunderstandings.\n\n\u201cI have difficulty in understanding Egypt,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said, stressing that the people to people relationship between Turkey and Egypt was quite deep-rooted in comparison with the Greek people. This is something the Egyptian authorities should recognize, he added.\n\nErdo\u011fan also slammed French President Emmanuel Macron for France\u2019s efforts to escalate tension in the region.\n\nBern proposes mediation between Turkey and Greece\n\nMeanwhile, \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said Switzerland has offered mediation between Turkey and Greece to narrow differences over the Mediterranean, to which Ankara agreed in principle.\n\n\u201cWe always welcome and listen to mediation proposals from Switzerland as a country with an objective point of view on regional and international matters,\u201d he stated.\n\nTurkey wants to resolve the problems in its region through dialogue and constructive diplomacy and paused the work of Oru\u00e7 Reis upon the initiative of Germany, \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said.\n\n\u201cBut Greece, in the middle of a process of the mediation by Germany, signed an agreement with Egypt without notifying Germany and Josep Borrell [EU\u2019S top diplomat.]\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Turkey has urged Greece to avoid provocative actions against its research vessel Oru\u00e7 Reis deployed in the eastern Mediterranean or it will be retaliated in kind, a statement in reference to an incident between the two countries involving a frigate, which was later described as \u201can accident\u201d by the Greek authorities.", "keywords": "Turkey,Greece,Oru\u00e7 Reis,East Mediterranean,Erdo\u011fan", "news_keywords": "Turkey,Greece,Oru\u00e7 Reis,East Mediterranean,Erdo\u011fan", "og": {"title": "Turkey urges Greece not to provoke its research vessel in Med - Turkey News", "description": "Turkey has urged Greece to avoid provocative actions against its research vessel Oru\u00e7 Reis deployed in the eastern Mediterranean or it will be retaliated in kind, a statement in reference to an incident between the two countries involving a frigate, which was later described as \u201can accident\u201d by the Greek authorities.", "image": "https://i.hurimg.com/i/hdn/75/200x200/5f36764ac9de3d27f452eb97.jpg", "site_name": "H\u00fcrriyet Daily News", "url": "https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-urges-greece-not-to-provoke-its-research-vessel-in-med-157404", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@HDNER", "url": "https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-urges-greece-not-to-provoke-its-research-vessel-in-med-157404", "title": "Turkey urges Greece not to provoke its research vessel in Med - Turkey News", "description": "Turkey has urged Greece to avoid provocative actions against its research vessel Oru\u00e7 Reis deployed in the eastern Mediterranean or it will be retaliated in kind, a statement in reference to an incident between the two countries involving a frigate, which was later described as \u201can accident\u201d by the Greek authorities.", "image": {"src": "https://i.hurimg.com/i/hdn/75/200x200/5f36764ac9de3d27f452eb97.jpg"}, "account_id": 87645208}}}}
