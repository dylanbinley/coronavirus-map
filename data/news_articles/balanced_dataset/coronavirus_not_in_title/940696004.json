It has rumbled on ever since.\n\nA breakthrough happened at the start of this year when both countries agreed to relax some restrictions on each other, referred to as \"phase one\" of the negotiations.\n\nWhat was the \"phase one\" deal?\n\nThe agreement in January was seen as a \"win-win\" deal according to Chinese officials.\n\nChina pledged to boost US imports by $200bn above 2017 levels including agriculture goods by $32bn and manufacturing products by $78bn.\n\nIt also agreed to strengthen its intellectual property rules by taking more action against counterfeiting and trade secret theft.\n\nIn exchange, the US agreed to halve some of the new tariffs it has imposed on Chinese products.\n\nWhile the majority of the border taxes remained in place, it was widely viewed as a thawing of trade tensions.\n\nWhere are we now?\n\nJust over six months after the agreement came into effect, the landscape is very different. US-China relations are increasingly tense and global trade has been severely hampered by the virus pandemic.\n\n\"Given the wide range of differences between the US and China, it may be difficult to achieve further significant progress in the upcoming round of trade talks,\" added Mr Biswas.\n\nChina's commitment to buy at least $200bn more in US goods and services during 2020 and 2021 is one area of concern.\n\nEven before the deal was signed, some trade experts said this was an unrealistic target. It has become more difficult with the coronavirus-driven slump in both the Chinese and US economies.\n\nThe virtual meeting is likely to see officials study Chinese and US trade data to determine whether the targets can still be met.\n\n\"Our baseline view is that the deal will remain intact after the meetings. It would be just too costly, for both sides, to terminate it now,\" added EIU's Mr Marro.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The two economic superpowers have seen tensions rise considerably since their last negotiations.", "x-country": "us", "x-audience": "Domestic", "CPS_AUDIENCE": "Domestic", "CPS_CHANGEQUEUEID": 161645805, "og": {"title": "What to expect as China-US trade talks resume", "type": "article", "description": "The two economic superpowers have seen tensions rise considerably since their last negotiations.", "site_name": "BBC News", "locale": "en_GB", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53761333", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/181B7/production/_113934789_trumpandxi.jpg", "alt": "BBC News.
