Health officials have been inspecting the home of the young man. His death marks the second case in the state this year after a man in his 60s died of the disease in June.\n\n\n\nTrending\n\nIn late June a man in his 60s became the first to be diagnosed in 2020 and was recovering in hospital. Both men lived more than 100 miles away from each other, so the cases are not thought to be linked. New Mexico Department of Health Secretary Kathy Kunkel said: \"Plague activity in New Mexico is usually highest during the summer months, so it is especially important now to take precautions to avoid rodents and their fleas which can expose you to plague.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says more than 80 per cent of United States plague cases have been the bubonic form.\n\nBubonic plague: A man has died of bubonic plague in New Mexico after China went into lockdown\n\nThe disease is caused by a bacteria called Yesinia Pestis which most commonly affect rodents, but they can be bitten by fleas which can then pass it on to humans. Cases of bubonic plague are very rare and can be treated with antibiotics quickly, but it still has a fatality rate of between 30 to 60% per cent. In recent decades, an average of seven cases have been reported each year with a range of one to 17. Plague has occurred in people of all ages, although 50 per cent of cases occur in people ages 12 to 45.

A man died in the region's city of Bayannur from multiple organ failure after contracting the deadly disease. Authorities tracked the man's movements back to his village and sealed it off. This is the second village to be placed in quarantine within the past few weeks. Authorities in Bayannur said: \"The place of residence of the deceased is locked down, and a comprehensive epidemiological investigation is being carried out.\"\n\nThe statement added: \"Currently, there is a risk of the human plague spreading in our city.\" Last Thursday another person died from the bubonic plague. This was in the adjacent city of Baotou. Health officials in this city announced a villager there had died of circulatory system failure due to infection with bubonic plague.\n\nBubonic plague: 1912 - A doctor wears protective clothing during an outbreak of plague in Manchuria", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "A MAN in his 20s has died of bubonic plague in the US after China was sent into lockdown due to a rise in cases in the Inner Mongolia province.", "fb": {"pages": 129617873765147, "app_id": 823607694325129}, "og": {"title": "China bubonic plague spreads in US leaving young man in his 20s dead", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1322668/china-bubonic-plague-spread-US-man-dead-new-mexico-cases-coronavirus-latest-news", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/750x445/1322668.jpg", "site_name": "Express.co.uk", "language": "en", "tags": "ctp_video,autoplay_video,china,bubonic plague,plague spread,US,man dead,new mexico,bubonic plague cases,coronavirus,latest news", "section": "World", "description": "A MAN in his 20s has died of bubonic plague in the US after China was sent into lockdown due to a rise in cases in the Inner Mongolia province."}, "news_keywords": "ctp_video,autoplay_video,china,bubonic plague,plague spread,US,man dead,new mexico,bubonic plague cases,coronavirus,latest news", "article": {"tag": "latest news", "published_time": "2020-08-14T03:36:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T13:07:39+01:00", "expiration_time": "2020-09-13", "section": "World", "image_count": 4, "video_count": 1, "word_count": 737, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 0}, "author": "Grace MacRae", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"src": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/750x445/1322668.jpg"}, "title": "China bubonic plague spreads in US leaving young man in his 20s dead", "description": "A MAN in his 20s has died of bubonic plague in the US after China was sent into lockdown due to a rise in cases in the Inner Mongolia province."}, "video_autoplay": "false", "headline_short": "China bubonic plague spreads in US leaving young man in his 20s dead", "verify-v1": "EGl3XPBuem43awGwLC1rXGpRHRnmNSwp7VZfnCAAcKE=", "msvalidate.01": "1960193A20395DAD3FCB640BCB0D91D7", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "noodp,noydir,all"}}}
