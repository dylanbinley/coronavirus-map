Vatican Media/Handout via REUTERS\n\nVATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis called for dialogue between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan on Saturday, urging them not to let a dispute over a dam on the Nile lead to conflict.\n\nThe Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is being built some 15 km (9 miles) from Ethiopia\u2019s border with Sudan, has become a major source of discord between the three countries.\n\n\u201cI invite all parties involved to continue on the path of dialogue so that the eternal river will continue to be a source of life, which unites and does not divide, which nurtures friendship, prosperity and fraternity and not enmity, misunderstanding and conflict,\u201d the pontiff said.\n\nHe was giving his Angelus message for Assumption Day, the most important Catholic feast dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\n\nEgypt, which fears the dam project could lead to water shortages upstream, has threatened to withdraw from the latest round of discussions. Sudan is concerned about the dam\u2019s safety.", "METADATA": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "worldNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "worldNews;IN-The-Wire;INWire_EL;everythingNews", "description": "Pope Francis called for dialogue between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan on Saturday, urging them not to let a dispute over a dam on the Nile lead to conflict.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "ETHIOPIA,DAM,POPE,Water and Other Utilities (TRBC),Egypt,Christianity,Water,Society / Social Issues,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Italy,Vatican City,Personalities / People,Africa,Ethiopia,Sudan,Europe,Middle East,Religion / Belief,Nigeria,Hydroelectric Power Stations", "news_keywords": "ETHIOPIA;DAM;POPE;Water and Other Utilities (TRBC);Egypt;Christianity;Water;Society / Social Issues;Diplomacy / Foreign Policy;Italy;Vatican City;Personalities / People;Africa;Ethiopia;Sudan;Europe;Middle East;Religion / Belief;Nigeria;Hydroelectric Power Stations", "REVISION_DATE": "Sat Aug 15 11:27:19 UTC 2020", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2020-08-15T11:27:19+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://in.reuters.com/article/ethiopia-dam-pope-idINKCN25B0KK", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Pope calls for dialogue between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan over Nile dam", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "IN", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "ETHIOPIA,DAM,POPE,Water and Other Utilities (TRBC),Egypt,Christianity,Water,Society / Social Issues,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Italy,Vatican City,Personalities / People,Africa,Ethiopia,Sudan,Europe,Middle East,Religion / Belief,Nigeria,Hydroelectric Power Stations", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "ETHIOPIA-DAM-POPE", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Pope calls for dialogue between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan over Nile dam", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2020-08-15T11:27:19+0000", "sailthru.title": "Pope calls for dialogue between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan over Nile dam", "og": {"locale": "en_IN", "site_name": "IN", "title": "Pope calls for dialogue between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan over Nile dam", "url": "https://in.reuters.com/article/ethiopia-dam-pope-idINKCN25B0KK", "type": "article", "description": "Pope Francis called for dialogue between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan on Saturday, urging them not to let a dispute over a dam on the Nile lead to conflict.", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200815&t=2&i=1529737033&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7E0CS", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-15T11:27:19+0000", "modified_time": "2020-08-15T11:27:19+0000", "section": "World", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "ETHIOPIA,DAM,POPE,Water and Other Utilities (TRBC),Egypt,Christianity,Water,Society / Social Issues,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Italy,Vatican City,Personalities / People,Africa,Ethiopia,Sudan,Europe,Middle East,Religion / Belief,Nigeria,Hydroelectric Power Stations"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/india.reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ReutersIndia", "creator": "@ReutersIndia", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Pope calls for dialogue between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan over Nile dam", "description": "Pope Francis called for dialogue between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan on Saturday, urging them not to let a dispute over a dam on the Nile lead to conflict.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200815&t=2&i=1529737033&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7E0CS", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200815&t=2&i=1529737033&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7E0CS"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "in.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Article - News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "World - World", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "World", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "World", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}}}
