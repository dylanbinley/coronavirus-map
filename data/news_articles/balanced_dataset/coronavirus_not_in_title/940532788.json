We have to be very flexible, innovative and patient,\" he said.\n\nLai, along with his two sons and four senior employees of the tabloid-style newspaper known for its scathing criticisms of Beijing, was arrested on Monday when more than 200 officers raided the Apple Daily offices, sparking an international backlash.\n\nIn the 40-minute live chat with the US think tank on Thursday, the 72-year-old said he did not expect the arrests to come so early, considering the \"strong responses from the international community\" after Beijing imposed the sweeping national security law on June 30, the SCMP reported.\n\nLai is the first high-profile figure to be held under the new law which is aimed at punishing acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces to endanger national security.", "METADATA": {"description": "Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai, who was arrested over alleged collusion with foreign forces, said on Thursday that there would be no world peace without changing China, calling on Americans to support the citys fight for freedom, it was ...", "fb": {"pages": 118531791506124, "app_id": 121476094536573}, "og": {"url": "https://www.prokerala.com/news/articles/a1072203.html", "type": "article", "title": "No world peace without changing China: HK media mogul", "description": "Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai, who was arrested over alleged collusion with foreign forces, said on Thursday that there would be no world peace with....", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.prokerala.com/news/photos/imgs/1200/arrested-hong-kong-tycoon-tells-protesters-to-be-careful-1048014.jpg", "alt": "Arrested Hong Kong tycoon tells protesters to be 'careful'", "width": 1200, "height": 786}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@prokerala", "title": "No world peace without changing China: HK media mogul", "description": "Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai, who was arrested over alleged collusion with foreign forces, said on Thursday that there would be no world peace with....", "creator": "@prokerala", "domain": "www.prokerala.com", "url": "https://www.prokerala.com/news/articles/a1072203.html", "image": {"src": "https://www.prokerala.com/news/photos/imgs/1200/arrested-hong-kong-tycoon-tells-protesters-to-be-careful-1048014.jpg", "alt": "Arrested Hong Kong tycoon tells protesters to be 'careful'"}}, "theme-color": "#000000", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no"}}}
