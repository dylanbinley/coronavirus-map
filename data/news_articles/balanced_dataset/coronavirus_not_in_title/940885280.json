While Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in a speech in Tokyo, didn\u2019t offer any direct apologies for the damage caused in the region from the country\u2019s past militarism, Emperor Naruhito said at the same ceremony that bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse, he hopes \u201cthe ravages of war will never be repeated.\u201d\n\nAbe on Saturday also spoke of Japan\u2019s new military doctrine of \u201cproactive pacifism.\u201d He has long pressed a revision of Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution and has been accused by critics of trying to whitewash the country\u2019s militarist past.\n\nAbe usually marks the anniversary by sending a ceremonial gift via an aide to Tokyo\u2019s Yasukuni Shrine, which honors 14 wartime leaders convicted as Class A war criminals alongside other war dead. He did the same this year, Kyodo News reported. A personal visit to a shrine viewed by some as a symbol of Japan\u2019s past militarism would be seen by Seoul as crossing a diplomatic red line. Abe hasn\u2019t made a pilgrimage since 2013.\n\nStill, four members of his Cabinet were at the shrine on Saturday. Japanese Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi -- the 38-year-old son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and a rising political star -- paid his respects, becoming the first sitting cabinet minister to do so on the anniversary in four years. Education Minister Koichi Hagiuda and Seiichi Eto, minister in charge of Okinawa and Northern territories affairs, and Internal Affairs Minister Sanae Takaichi also visited.\n\nIt isn\u2019t immediately clear how the shrine visits will impact relations. Any renewed acrimony between America\u2019s two most powerful allies in Asia could prove troublesome for President Donald Trump, as his administration tries to curtail the nuclear threat from North Korea and seeks support as it steps up its pressure campaign against China, trying to contain Beijing\u2019s push into the South China Sea.\n\nTokyo has said that all claims were settled completely and finally under a 1965 treaty that set up basic relations between the two. Seoul has seen its Supreme Court decision as a victory for human rights, arguing that victims\u2019 individual rights to file a claim have not expired due to the 1965 agreement.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision has the highest legal authority and enforcement power within the territories of the Republic of Korea,\u201d Moon said in his speech on Saturday to mark Korea\u2019s National Liberation Day. \u201cWe are always ready to discuss this matter with Japan.\u201d\n\nMoon and Abe have found support at home for taking a hard line against each other. But they both have taken cautious moves in recent years on the anniversary, in a sign that they are aware of the dangers of using the day to overtly antagonize the other.\n\n\u201cWe will work together with Japan to protect democracy, universal values and principles of international law,\u201d Moon said. \u201cI believe the bilateral cooperation to respect human rights would work as a \u2018bridge of friendship\u2019 between the two nations.\u201d\n\nTensions between the two recently intensified after a district court in the eastern South Korean city of Pohang initiated a process which enabled the seizing of shares that Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel Corp. has in a joint venture with South Korean steelmaker Posco. Nippon Steel immediately appealed the notice.\n\nApart from the disputes surrounding colonial-era labor, the two U.S. allies are also squaring off at the World Trade Organization over Tokyo\u2019s decision to restrict exports of electronics components vital for South Korea\u2019s tech sector.\n\nMoon on Saturday also proposed that North Korea work together in environmental management issues to accelerate inter-Korean reconciliation.\n\nThe two Koreas are \u201cin the same boat when it comes to protecting the safety of its citizens,\u201d Moon said. \u201cWe must co-manage the rivers and streams.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea released water from a border dam water without notifying South Korea last week, a violation of an inter-Korean agreement. It opened the floodgates of Hwanggang Dam on the western inter-Korean border and discharged water into the Imjin River, putting officials in Seoul on alert against the potential rise in water levels.\n\n(Updates with Moon\u2019s speech and shrine visits by Japan ministers)\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "METADATA": {"civicscience": {"jspoll-hostname": "www138.civicscience.com"}, "application-name": "Moon Says South Korea Ready to Discuss Tensions With Japan", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "World News", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- South Korean President Moon Jae-In said his administration remains ready to mend ties with Japan after more than a year of tensions, and as both sides hold ceremonies to remember Japan\u2019s World War II surrender in 1945 that ended its brutal colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula.
