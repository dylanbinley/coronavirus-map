One party. One country of 1.4 billion people. Little wonder Chairman-for-life Xi Jinping is worried about maintaining absolute authority.\n\nTo do so, he\u2019s painted a nationalistic picture of China\u2019s future. It\u2019s as good as \u2013 if not greater \u2013 than at any point in its 2000-year history.\n\nNow, he has to deliver. That\u2019s not proving so easy.\n\nFloods. Insects. Famine. COVID-19. All are affecting food supplies and prices.\n\nXi quickly fell back on the tried-and-tested fallback position for most embattled authoritarian leaders: extol the nation\u2019s greatness, its glorious history, its manifest destiny \u2013 and blame everybody else for its woes.\n\nRELATED: China\u2019s relentless attacks on arch rivals\n\nRELATED: Satellite images expose China\u2019s plan\n\nmedia_camera Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018wolf warrior\u2019 tactic isn\u2019t working.

Canada. India. Japan. Vietnam. All have stood firm in the face of extraordinary Chinese threats and intimidation. And, for Chairman Xi, that\u2019s humiliating.\n\nNow rumbles are beginning within his halls of power. Has Xi squandered China\u2019s great chance to take its rightful place on the world stage?\n\nInstead of backing down in the face of threatened economic sanctions, Canberra has hardened its insistence upon the rule of international law over the East and South China Seas.\n\nRELATED: China\u2019s mysterious \u2018dark fleet\u2019 exposed\n\nmedia_camera Along with Britain, Canada, India, Japan and Vietnam, Australia is just one of the countries fighting back against China\u2019s threatened sanctions. Picture: NCA NewsWire /Gary Ramage\n\nMalaysia, facing frequent incursions on its economic zone and interference with its commercial operations in the South China Sea, issued a formal note of complaint about China\u2019s actions late last year. Vietnam, Brunei, Indonesia and the Philippines have followed suit.\n\nEven Somalia has taken a stand. Chinese ambassador Qin Jian reportedly attempted a \u2018wolf-warrior\u2019 tack in recent talks with President Muse Bihi. He was given \u201cmarching orders\u201d, and Somalia\u2019s government initiated diplomatic contact with Taiwan.\n\nPresident Muse Bihi's pluck in standing up to China's wolf-warrior diplomacy surprising only to those that don't know Somaliland, its history.\n\n\n\nSomalilanders tough as nail, know where they came from, built strong, functioning state against odds\n\n\n\nThey won't sell themselves short. \u2014 Rashid Abdi (@RAbdiCG) August 5, 2020\n\nHIGH-PROFILE CRITICISM\n\nRichard McGregor at the Lowy Institute points out there are concealed signs of dissent among Beijing\u2019s elite.\n\nThe recent high-profile arrest of Beijing-based Professor of constitutional law Xu Zhangrun may be a veiled warning to them all. The legal scholar\u2019s crime was to advocate equality under the law for all Chinese citizens.\n\nIt took a dozen police to arrest the 57-year-old intellectual at his Beijing apartment last month. But, he was ready. He\u2019d long since said he kept a spare set of clothes by the door to take with him when detained.\n\nHe\u2019s now a subject of the Communist Party-controlled legal system he dared criticise.\n\nCoercion may be working well to silence internal dissent. Internationally? Not so much.\n\nAnd behind the barks and growls of his \u2018wolf warrior\u2019 diplomats, Xi must now contend with grumbling generals.\n\nVOICES OF DISSENT IN THE RANKS\n\nRetired Major General Qiao Liang and a serving PLA Air Force Senior Colonel Dai Xu are two prominent voices sounding a note of discord in Beijing in recent weeks.\n\nQiao is one of the founders of China\u2019s modern military doctrine after publishing his book Unrestricted Warfare in 1999.\n\nHe\u2019s dared to contradict Chairman Xi\u2019s aggressive threats to take control of neighbouring Taiwan by force.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s ultimate goal is not the reunification of Taiwan, but to achieve the dream of national rejuvenation so that all 1.4 billion Chinese can have a good life,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cCould it be achieved by taking Taiwan back? Of course not.\u201d\n\nSenior Colonel Dai was even blunter about the potential cost of a cold war with the US in an essay entitled: 2020, Four Unexpected Things and Ten New Understandings About the United States.\n\n\u201cThe US would be so tough, imposing stacked tariff increases of 30 billion, 50 billion and then 200 billion,\u201d he writes. \u201cRemember: the 30 billion in tariffs imposed on you will bring an effect of 60 billion, 90 billion, or more. This is where Imperial America is truly powerful. We must be rational instead of angry and fight wisely.\u201d\n\nPeople\u2019s Liberation Army Senior Colonel Zhou Bo has also rejected his great leader\u2019s belligerent tone in a recent article for the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post. Instead of being a crisis, he argued the latest dispute with Washington was merely a \u201cheadwind\u201d. It was all to be expected as Beijing continued to \u201cdevelop peacefully\u201d and Washington languished in decline.\n\n\u201cEven if the US is in retreat, Beijing has more serious business to attend to than confront Washington, most importantly the \u2018great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\u2019 by 2049\u201d.\n\nmedia_camera PLA Air Force Senior Colonel Dai Xu has ruled out a cold war with the US saying the US would be \u201cso tough\u201d.

Not the government. Not the law. The Communist Party.\n\nAnd Xi is its Chairman without a time limit.\n\n\u201cThe PLA led by our Party has been the staunch pillar of the people\u2019s republic, a great wall of steel in defence of the motherland and an important force in socialist construction,\u201d an editorial on the ChinaMil official PLA website reads.\n\n\u201cAnd loyalty to the CPC is the soul and lifeblood of the PLA and the reason why the PLA can overcome difficulties and achieve victories.\u201d\n\nArticle after article. Video after video. This message is proclaimed over and over again.\n\nAs Beijing has learnt several times in the past century, a powerful military can be a two-edged sword. A mutiny in 1927 led to the militarisation of the CCP and the successful 1949 revolution.\n\n\u201cChina will continue to uphold and improve the Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the armed forces and ensure that they will faithfully fulfil their missions in the new era,\u201d the Central Committee decreed last year.\n\nThis year, they\u2019ve been giving the PLA cause to be distracted \u2013 heightened tensions in the East and South China Sea, in the Himalayas, against Taiwan and the United States.\n\n\u201cPrepare For Worst-Case Scenarios,\u201d Xi instructed his troops in May.\n\n\u201cAlthough the main objective of Beijing\u2019s nationalist push has been to build domestic support for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), it has also stoked tensions with Washington, as each side tries to outdo the other in shifting blame and avoiding accountability,\u201d associate professor Jessica Chen Weiss of Cornell University writes in Foreign Affairs.\n\n\u201cWolf warrior diplomacy might appease Chinese nationalists at home, but it will limit China\u2019s appeal abroad. And xenophobia and repression in the name of national stability \u2014 whether toward African migrants in Guangzhou, Central Asian minorities in Xinjiang, or ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong \u2014 have given the lie to Chinese efforts to project a benevolent and magnanimous image.\u201d\n\nLOSING FRIENDS\n\nBeijing is rapidly losing what friends it has.\n\n\u201cChina has provided assistance to so many countries, benefiting them in so many ways, but at this critical moment, none of them has taken any unified action with China,\u201d Colonel Dai bemoans.\n\nThis fallout is also severely affecting many key Chinese corporations with strong ties to the military\u2019s leadership. Alibaba, Huawei and Tencent are just the most prominent names facing an intense international backlash.\n\nTheir financial losses will be felt personally by many PLA generals.\n\nAnd unhappy generals make for uneasy authoritarian leaders.\n\nmedia_camera Chinese president Xi Jinping now has a decision to make about what his next move will be. Picture: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images.\n\nMust Xi back down? Or must Xi escalate?\n\nMcGregor says Beijing is unlikely to back down as it has a \u201cpowerful military and a political system with a profoundly adversarial mindset toward the West\u201d.\n\n\u201cThose factors alone, along with Xi\u2019s ambitions for China and his iron discipline in executing them, make it difficult for China to set a new course,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey have already \u2018made America angry\u2019, and it will be hard to turn that around. Similarly, these factors have also ensured that the more concerted global pushback against China will be sustained for some time yet.\u201d\n\nWeiss agrees. \u201cEven if Beijing recognises these problems, it will be costly \u2014 although not impossible \u2014 for the Chinese leadership to constrain the nationalism it has unleashed.\u201d\n\nJamie Seidel is a freelance writer | @JamieSeidel\n\nOriginally published as China\u2019s massive mistake exposed", "METADATA": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "referrer": "origin", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/adelaidenow/ms-icon-70x70.png", "msapplication-square144x144logo": "https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/adelaidenow/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/adelaidenow/ms-icon-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/adelaidenow/ms-icon-310x310.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/adelaidenow/ms-icon-144x144.png", "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Key generals have attacked Xi Jinping for squandering Chinas big chance.
