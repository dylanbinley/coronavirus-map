Now it\u2019s threatening to \u201cplay\u201d next door to a significant US Pacific base.\n\n\u201cIf the US goes further, the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) could take more countermeasures, including live-fire missile drills east of Taiwan Island and near Guam,\u201d a senior Chinese Communist Party official warns.\n\nThe comment came in response to the visit of US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to Taiwan \u2013 the highest-ranked US official to do so for several decades.\n\nBeijing considers this a direct provocation. It insists the self-governed democracy, which never capitulated to the Communist revolution of 1949, to be its sovereign territory.\n\nChina\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, on Thursday tweeted: \u201cOn Taiwan issue, anyone playing with fire will get burned\u201d.\n\nChina firmly safeguards its core interests and firmly opposes any official interaction between #US and #Taiwan. On Taiwan issue, anyone playing with fire will get burned. https://t.co/xn3GYwBmhH \u2014 Liu Xiaoming (@AmbLiuXiaoMing) August 12, 2020\n\nRELATED: China\u2019s massive mistake exposed\n\nRELATED: China\u2019s brazen move in South China Sea\n\n\u201cThey probably will do an air-naval strike exercise east of Taiwan. If Xi (Chinese President Xi Jinping) wants to send a threat, it may include a ballistic missile launch into the waters west of Guam,\u201d military analyst Carl Schuster told CNN.\n\nGuam is an important mid-Pacific island base regularly used by US naval and air forces.\n\n\u201cI am sure the idea is on the table since the Chinese military would not publish such bombastic rhetoric on its initiative. Someone of authority in the Communist Party or PLA feels that way and is pushing for it,\u201d he said.\n\nBut US Indo-Pacific Command spokesman Major Randy Ready told CNN the US military \u201cwon\u2019t speculate on hypothetical exercises that may or may not take place in the future.\u201d\n\nLARGE SCALE \u2018WAR GAMES\u2019\n\nThe US this week positioned the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan in the nearby Japanese controlled Senkaku and Diaoyu Islands region as Chinese combat aircraft step up their \u2018probing\u2019 of Taiwanese and Japanese airspace.\n\nRELATED: Satellite images expose China\u2019s plan\n\nBeijing, however, is blaming the US for the increased tempo of its military operations.\n\n\u201cThe PLA drills come amid the increasingly frequent provocative military activities made by the US near the island of Taiwan and in waters in the South China Sea,\u201d the state-controlled Global Times states.\n\n\u201cGround and naval forces of the PLA have been on concentrated schedules in amphibious landing and maritime exercises in the past weeks and will continue to do so in the weeks to come.\u201d\n\nOpen source analysts have deconstructed propaganda photos and say Beijing has deployed strategic bombers to the South China Sea fortress Woody Island for the first time. This is in contravention of its assertion that such facilities serve no purpose other than sea rescue facilities.\n\nChina's H-6J bombers deployed to Woody Island in the South China Sea. pic.twitter.com/LJ1zaKw2gn \u2014 Duan Dang (@duandang) August 12, 2020\n\nIt\u2019s a clear diplomatic signal of Beijing\u2019s hardening resolve to assume absolute control over the strategically vital waterway between Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nThe bombers may also be scaling-up ongoing combat exercises. So far, these have included practising beach assaults by amphibious and naval units and wide-ranging air strikes. Live weapons will be fired at sea near Shanghai this week as part of this training process.\n\nBut the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post news service cites an unnamed military source as saying Beijing has warned PLA personnel \u201cnot to fire the first shot\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to give the order to shoot, but neither China nor the US is able to control the consequences. The current situation is highly tense and very dangerous,\u201d the source said. \u201cBut we are very clear that we will respond with force only as the last resort, when everything else has failed.\u201d\n\nEYES IN THE SKY\n\nBeijing\u2019s \u2018wolf-warrior\u2019 commentators and diplomats have taken aim at US surveillance flights monitoring its military activities in the South China Sea.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi accused the US of having sent more than 2000 military flights through the area so far this year. Thursday, Beijing claimed some posed a \u201crisk\u201d to civilian aircraft.\n\nThe South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI), a Beijing-based think-tank, says four\u2019 close up\u2019 US reconnaissance flights have been made in the region of Guangdong so far this month.\n\nBeijing is alleging at least one of these aircraft attempted to disguise itself as a passenger airliner and flew along commercial flight corridors.\n\nUS surveillance aircraft appearing like commercial airliner constantly fly near China. They even follow civil aviation flights to confuse Chinese radars. This poses a threat to safety of civil aircraft over the South China Sea. It\u2019s shameful for the US military to do so. pic.twitter.com/MHRDuJklCW \u2014 Hu Xijin \u80e1\u9521\u8fdb (@HuXijin_GT) August 12, 2020\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible to cause accidents or misjudgements amid the escalating tensions between the Chinese and US militaries,\u201d an unnamed source told the South China Morning Post. \u201cThe South China Sea is one of the world\u2019s busiest international airspaces, which may put civil aircraft at risk.\u201d\n\nAs if to emphasise that risk, Chinese state-controlled media has been lauding combat exercises in the region involving its anti-aircraft units.\n\n\u201cThe drills featured some of the top PLA anti-aircraft artillery, and showed the PLA\u2019s readiness to safeguard national security,\u201d the Global Times quotes an unnamed military source as saying.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the Army air defence troops, the Air Force is responsible for longer-range air defence, and the Navy will also keep aerial threats from the sea at bay.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a risky scenario. The former Soviet Union claimed it shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983 because it believed it to be a surveillance aircraft.\n\nIn 1988, the cruiser USS Vincennes shot down Iran Air Flight 655 after mistaking it for an Iranian F-14 Tomcat fighter. In 2014, Russian troops operating covertly inside Ukraine shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 thinking it was an opposition warplane. Earlier this year, Iranian missiles downed a Boeing 737 as it took off from Tehran.\n\n\u201cThere have been some accidents that happened when ground-based missile defence troops failed to verify intruding aircraft carefully,\u201d Taiwan military analyst Lu Li-shih told the Morning Post. \u201cWar allows deceit.\u201d\n\nJamie Seidel is a freelance writer | @JamieSeidel", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "tcog", "articleid": "360e51d60bc15f5fa205cabd3494a839", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T00:59:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T21:27:57.000Z", "publisher": "News Limited", "author": "Jamie Seidel", "publicationdate": "15/08/2020"}, "description": "Beijing has stepped up the pace of its war games in recent weeks after the US sent two aircraft carrier strike groups into the South China Sea.
