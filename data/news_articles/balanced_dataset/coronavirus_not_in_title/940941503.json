It also sets out a formula for sharing the logistical and infrastructure costs of an expanded US presence in the country.\n\nSome 4,500 US troops are currently based in Poland, but about 1,000 more are to be added, under a bilateral decision announced last year. Last month, in line with President Donald Trump\u2019s demand to reduce troop numbers in Germany, the Pentagon announced that some 12,000 troops would be withdrawn from Germany with about 5,600 moving to other countries in Europe, including Poland.\n\nIn addition, several US military commands will be moved out of Germany, including the US Army V Corps overseas headquarters that will relocate to Poland next year.\n\nTrump has long and loudly complained that Germany does not spend enough on defense and has repeatedly accused Germany of failing to pay NATO bills, which is a misstatement of the issue. NATO nations have pledged to dedicate 2% of their gross domestic product.\n\nSaturday\u2019s signing came just a day after the Trump administration suffered an embarrassing diplomatic loss at the United Nations when its proposal to indefinitely extend an arms embargo on Iran was soundly defeated in a UN Security Council vote that saw only one country side with the US. Pompeo will visit that country, the Dominican Republic, on Sunday for the inauguration of its new president.\n\nPompeo has used his Europe trip to warn the region\u2019s young democracies about threats posed by Russia and China and has received a warm welcome. In Poland, the reception was particularly kind given the friendship between Trump and conservative Polish President Duda, who was sworn in for a second five-year term earlier this month after a hotly contested election.\n\nMany of Duda\u2019s Law and Justice party\u2019s policies have put Poland at odds with the European Union, which is concerned that government efforts to reshape the judiciary and other actions have eroded the rule of law and democracy in the EU member country.", "METADATA": {"google-site-verification": "U3xIlrlaetYrU7V1lNSFthKZzBFJ_S6qVzdn_gpMNjc", "keywords": "United States, Poland, Germany, Mike Pompeo, Europe, American Troops", "news_keywords": "United States, Poland, Germany, Mike Pompeo, Europe, American Troops", "description": "In Warsaw at the end of a four-nation tour of central and eastern Europe, Pompeo and Polish Defense Minister Mariusz B\u0142aszczak signed an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement that sets out the legal framework for the additional troop presence.", "og": {"locale": "en_us", "type": "article", "title": "Mike Pompeo inks deal for United States troops move from Germany to Poland", "description": "In Warsaw at the end of a four-nation tour of central and eastern Europe, Pompeo and Polish Defense Minister Mariusz B\u0142aszczak signed an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement that sets out the legal framework for the additional troop presence.", "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-inks-deal-for-united-states-troops-move-from-germany-to-poland/story-g5u4dDh262sg4vOD5niq6K.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2020/08/15/Pictures/mike-pompeo-visit-to-central-europe_d1f1043a-dee2-11ea-b1b0-f6d177b03796.jpg", "width": 960, "height": 640}, "site_name": "Hindustan Times"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Mike Pompeo inks deal for United States troops move from Germany to Poland", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@httweets", "creator": "@httweets", "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-inks-deal-for-united-states-troops-move-from-germany-to-poland/story-g5u4dDh262sg4vOD5niq6K.html", "title": "Mike Pompeo inks deal for United States troops move from Germany to Poland - world news - Hindustan Times", "description": "In Warsaw at the end of a four-nation tour of central and eastern Europe, Pompeo and Polish Defense Minister Mariusz B\u0142aszczak signed an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement that sets out the legal framework for the additional troop presence.", "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2020/08/15/Pictures/mike-pompeo-visit-to-central-europe_d1f1043a-dee2-11ea-b1b0-f6d177b03796.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-15T16:04:22+05:30", "modified_time": "2020-08-15T16:04:22+05:30"}, "section": "world-news", "storyid": "67ab5d14-dee2-11ea-b1b0-f6d177b03796", "last-updated": "2020-08-15T16:04:22+05:30", "fb": {"pages": 111445058579, "app_id": 672336366190593, "admins": 100006810078735}, "Last-Modified": "2020-08-15T16:04:22+05:30", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}}}
