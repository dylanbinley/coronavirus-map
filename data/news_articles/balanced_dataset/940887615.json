Ivey\u2019s chief of staff in quarantine", "TEXT": "By The Associated Press undefined\n\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. \u2014 Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey\u2019s chief of staff is quarantining at home after his wife tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nIvey spokeswoman Gina Maiola says Ivey\u2019s Chief of Staff Jo Bonner doesn\u2019t have symptoms but is in quarantine at home. Bonner\u2019s wife took a test after attending a visitation for a funeral last Friday in Mobile where she later learned several other attendees had tested positive. Janee Bonner doesn\u2019t have symptoms of the virus, but the test was positive.\n\nMaiola says Bonner was not with the 75-year-old Republican governor this week and Janee hasn\u2019t been around the governor in several months.\n\n___\n\nHERE\u2019S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:\n\n\u2014 Spain enacts nationwide measures to curb virus\n\n\u2014 Paris, Marseille declared at-risk zones\n\n\u2014 Bolivia \u2018s political crisis threatens hospitals and patients\n\n\u2014 Spain is facing another surge in coronavirus infections not even two months after beating back the first wave\n\n\u2014 False claims and conspiracy theories have dogged efforts to control the pandemic from the beginning. The bad information can pose a particular threat to communities of people of color who already face worse health outcomes.\n\n\u2014 Indonesia\u2019 s only vaccine production company has injected the first volunteers with Chinese firm Sinovac\u2019s vaccine candidate in so-called phase 3 clinical trials.\n\n\u2014 Follow AP\u2019s pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\n___\n\nHERE\u2019S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s disease control center says a study of a previous coronavirus hotspot town indicates there were almost four times as many infections from an outbreak in March.\n\nThe Robert Koch Institute says recent blood tests conducted on 2,203 adults in the southwestern town of Kupferzell showed that 7.7% had antibodies for the coronavirus.\n\nIn March, about 100 people tested positive for the coronavirus with a swab test and three died following an outbreak linked to a church concert in Kupferzell, population 6,000.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors say this indicates more people were exposed to the coronavirus than previously thought and developed antibodies. The authors note many people with the virus show only minimal or no symptoms.\n\nAlso, more than a quarter of the people tested who had COVID-19 later showed no antibodies. However, the authors say this doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t have immunity to the virus.\n\n___\n\nATHENS, Greece \u2014 Greek authorities issued a \u201cstrong recommendation\u201d for people to wear masks for a week indoors and outdoors in public areas after returning from areas with high coronavirus cases.\n\nPublic gatherings will be limited to 50 people in all areas considered hot spots. A ban on restaurants, bars and nightclubs operating between midnight and 7 a.m. has been extended to cover much of the country, including the greater Athens area, until Aug. 24.\n\nAlso, Greek authorities say eight migrants have tested positive for coronavirs in a mainland camp for asylum-seekers in the northeastern Evros area. The Fylakio camp, which has about 200 residents near the Turkish border, was quarantined Friday.\n\nGreece had a record-high 262 new infections on Wednesday. There\u2019s been 6,400 confirmed infections and 221 total deaths.\n\n___\n\nANCHORAGE, Alaska \u2014 Some churches in Alaska\u2019s largest city have recently defied the emergency order limiting the size of gatherings to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nAlaska Public Media reported the Anchorage health order prohibits indoor gatherings of more than 15 people in public, including religious services.\n\nAnchorage Baptist Temple held in-person services Sunday, about a week after the emergency order took effect. Other churches saying they are not complying with the measure include the Wellspring Ministries and King\u2019s Chapel in Eagle River.\n\n___\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa has announced a range of new nationwide restrictions to help fight a surge in coronavirus cases.\n\nIlla said after an emergency meeting Friday with leaders of Spain\u2019s autonomous regions that authorities are shutting all discos and night clubs across Spain.\n\nVisits to nursing homes are limited to one person a day for each resident for only one hour. People are prohibited from smoking in public areas if they are unable to keep at least 2 meters (6.5 feet) away from others.\n\nPolice will begin cracking down harder on banned night-time street gatherings by young people to drink alcohol. New daily cases in Spain have been steadily climbing since the country on June 21 ended a more than three-month lockdown.\n\nAuthorities have officially recorded almost 50,000 cases in the past 14 days, an average of about 3,500 new cases a day.\n\n___\n\nTRENTON, N.J. \u2014 New Jersey\u2019s governor says the state will move to a nearly all-mail election this November, following the model it used for the July primary because of the coronavirus.\n\nDemocrat Gov. Phil Murphy said during an interview with CNN on Friday that all voters would get a ballot. It\u2019s not clear if people who aren\u2019t registered will get an application to register.\n\nMurphy indicated the only in-person voting will be with provisional ballots. That means if voters want to cast their ballot in person, they\u2019ll have to go to one of a reduced number of polling places and cast a ballot that will be counted only after officials determine the voter didn\u2019t mail in a ballot.\n\nIf the July 7 primary model is used, voters can mail back their ballots to county boards of elections, deliver them there in person or use one of five drop boxes across the county.\n\nThe development comes a day after President Donald Trump acknowledged he\u2019s starving the United States Postal Service of cash to make it harder to process millions of mailed-in ballots.\n\n___\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark \u2013 Norway officials are recommending masks on public transportation in Oslo.\n\nHealth Minister Bent Hoeie says masks must be used in Oslo and in a municipality southwest of the capital starting Monday.\n\nBergen banned private gatherings of more than 20 people after a local spike in coronavirus cases. Bergen has had 19 news coronavirus cases in the past two weeks.\n\nNationally, Norway has 261 confirmed deaths related to the virus.\n\n(This item has been corrected to show the ban on gathering of more than 20 people in Bergen, not Oslo.)\n\n___\n\nPARIS \u2014 The head of France\u2019s national health service says Paris and Marseille have been declared at-risk zones for the coronavirus as authorities observe a sharp increase in infections.\n\nJerome Salomon, speaking on France Inter radio, warned \u201cthe situation is deteriorating from week to week\u201d in the country. He says virus clusters emerge every day following family reunions, big parties and other gatherings amid summer holidays.\n\nA government decree issued Friday allows authorities to impose stricter measures in the Paris and Marseille areas.\n\nSalomon says there are \u201cmore and more people who tested positive, more and more people arriving in hospitals\u2026 we need to react before counting new deaths.\u201d\n\nThe national health agency reported 2,669 new infections across on Thursday, putting France\u2019s infection rate per 100,000 people to above 30.\n\n___\n\nLONDON \u2014 Britain has secured 90 million doses of two vaccines being developed to fight COVID-19.\n\nThe deals with Novavax, an American biotech company, and Janssen, a Belgian company owned by Johnson & Johnson, mean the U.K. has now acquired the rights to 340 million doses of six different experimental vaccines as the government seeks to hedge its bets on products that are still being tested to see if they are safe and effective.\n\nKate Bingham, chair of the government\u2019s Vaccines Taskforce, told ITV there was no guarantee any of the vaccines would work \u201cbecause there have been no vaccines against any human coronavirus.\n\n\u201cSo what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019ve chosen six of the most promising vaccines across four different vaccine types and we\u2019re hoping that one of those will work.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark \u2014 Denmark has added Belgium and Malta to its list of European nations where non-essential travels are not recommended as the Scandinavian country has seen a flare-up of coronavirus cases.\n\nThe Scandinavian country\u2019s reason for doing so is that both nations have seen more than 30 cases of coronavirus per 100,000 inhabitants. Danish health officials say the number is 32.5 for Belgium and 31.5 for Malta.\n\nAs of Friday midnight, people who travel from Belgium or Malta must self-quarantine upon return.\n\nDenmark earlier has listed Spain, Andorra, Bulgaria, Luxemburg and Romania as countries where non-essential travels are not recommended.\n\nDanes also don\u2019t recommend trips to countries outside Europe with the exception of Canada, New Zealand, Australia, South Korea, Georgia, Japan, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay.\n\n___\n\nBERLIN \u2014 German authorities in the western state of Baden-Wuerttemberg have established a new coronavirus testing station at a highway rest stop by the French border after noting a strong increase in cases in the neighboring country.\n\nThe dpa news agency reported Friday that the center has started testing travelers at the Neuenburg-Ost rest stop, across the border from the French town of Chalampe. Travelers from designated risk areas are required to be tested upon return to Germany, and the center will also test any others who want to be checked.\n\nFrance reported more than 10,000 new confirmed cases over the past week.\n\nBaden-Wuerttemberg already has test centers at airports in Stuttgart, Friedrichshafen and Baden-Baden, as well as the Stuttgart main train station.\n\nThe Neuenburg rest stop center is the first such station outside Bavaria, which has had roadside testing since the end of July. They have generated so much interest that Bavarian officials have reported a backlog of cases, with about 44,000 people not yet informed of their results, including more than 900 who tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nBaden-Wuerttemberg says it expects to be able to inform people within four days of their tests.\n\n___\n\nSYDNEY \u2014 A man in his 20s has become the youngest person to die of the coronavirus in Australia.\n\nHe was among 14 new deaths and 372 new infections reported by Victoria state health officials Friday in an outbreak centered in Melbourne, the second-largest city.\n\nAnd Prime Minister Scott Morrison said 188 elderly people had died over the past week as the virus ripped through aged-care homes in Melbourne. Officials say about 70% of Australia\u2019s 375 virus deaths have been at aged-care facilities.\n\nMorrison said that Australians had high expectations of the services and standards at nursing homes and other facilities like hospitals and schools.\n\nHe says, \u201cOn the days that the system falls short, on the days that expectations are not met, I\u2019m deeply sorry about that, of course I am.\u201d\n\nHe said the country was moving heaven and earth to defeat the virus and it would eventually win.\n\n___\n\nNEW DELHI \u2014 India\u2019s coronavirus death toll overtook Britain to become the fourth-highest in the world with another single-day record increase in cases Friday.\n\nAccording to the Health Ministry, India reported 1,007 deaths in the past 24 hours. Its total rose to 48,040 deaths, behind the United States, Brazil and Mexico.\n\nIndia\u2019s confirmed cases reached 2,461,190 with a single-day spike of 64,553 in the past 24 hours. More than 70% of people infected in India have recovered.\n\nThe daily increase in newly reported infections was around 15,000 in the first week of July but jumped to more than 50,000 in the first week of August. The ministry cited its testing efforts, with more than 800,000 tests in a single day, taking cumulative tests to more than 26 million.\n\nHealth experts say it needs to be higher, given India\u2019s population of 1.4 billion.\n\nIndia\u2019s two-month lockdown imposed nationwide in late March kept infections low. But it has eased and is now largely being enforced in high-risk areas. The new cases spiked after India reopened shops and manufacturing and allowed hundreds of thousands of migrant workers to return to their homes from coronavirus-hit regions.\n\nSubways, schools and movie theaters remain closed.\n\n___\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea is reporting 103 new coronavirus cases. It is one of the country\u2019s biggest daily jumps in months, and officials are expressing concern that infections are getting out of control in the capital of Seoul and other major cities as Koreans increasingly venture out in public.\n\nThe figures released by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday brought the national caseload to 14,873 cases, including 305 deaths.\n\nEighty-three of the new cases were in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where authorities have struggled to stem transmissions. Infections were also reported in other major cities such as Busan, Gwangju and Ulsan.\n\nFriday\u2019s jump was driven by local transmissions, which health authorities said could worsen because of the increase in travelers during the summer vacation season.\n\n___\n\nFRESNO, Calif. \u2014 A private school in California has been ordered to close after it reopened classrooms in violation of a state health order aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nFresno County issued a health order Thursday against Immanuel Schools in Reedley. The K-12 school was told to close its classrooms until the county is removed from a state monitoring list for two weeks.\n\nThe school has about 600 students and it allowed students into classes Thursday without masks or social distancing. The school\u2019s trustees and superintendent say they believe students\u2019 development will suffer if they can\u2019t be taught on campus.\n\n___\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China has reported another eight cases of locally transmitted coronavirus infections, all in the northwestern region of Xinjiang where the country\u2019s last major outbreak has been largely contained.\n\nOfficials said Friday that 22 other new cases were brought from outside the country by Chinese travelers returning home. China has reported a total of 4,634 deaths from COVID-19 among 84,786 cases.\n\nHong Kong reported 69 new confirmed cases and three deaths over the past 24 hours. The semi-autonomous Chinese city has required masks be worn in all public settings, restricted indoor dining and enacted other social distancing measures to bring down transmissions that now total 4,312 with 66 deaths.\n\n___", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#535aa7", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "#535aa7", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Latest: Alabama Gov.
