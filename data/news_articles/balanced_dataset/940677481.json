If Senate Republicans gave a damn about the future of our democracy, they would demand that the Trump administration return to the negotiating table on a Covid-19 relief bill that protects our elections and funds the post office.\u201d\n\nDuring his press briefing Wednesday evening, Trump vowed to continue blocking Democrats\u2019 demand for $3.5 billion in election assistance funding for states and $25 billion for the Postal Service, calling the requests \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\nTrump also praised Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a major Republican donor to the president who has imposed sweeping changes to Postal Service policy that have caused major mail backlogs across the United States, prompting concerns about timely delivery of mail-in ballots in November.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump knows that if the people are heard in November, he and Republicans up and down the ballot will lose,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted Thursday. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re up against\u2014and this is why we have to fight back with all we\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Trump that\u2018s destroying the US Post Office. It\u2019s the entire Republican Party. Senate & House GOP could easily override a Trump veto of postal funding and help oversight. Republicans are working with Trump to destroy the USPS and sabotage the delivery of ballots. https://t.co/5qIMUDxQot \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) August 13, 2020\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, House Democrats introduced a bill that would reverse DeJoy\u2019s new policies and bar any further operational changes until the end of the Covid-19 pandemic. It\u2019s not clear when the legislation could get a floor vote in the House.\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, stressed the urgency of congressional action to save the Postal Service in a tweet Thursday, warning that \u201cwe have a five alarm fire in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president is on TV brazenly, corruptly, and deliberately sabotaging the USPS,\u201d wrote Connolly. \u201cCongress must provide the Postal Service the financial resources needed to ensure a smooth process of mail-in ballots for the November election.\u201d\n\nJana Morgan, director of the Declaration for American Democracy\u2014a coalition of over 160 progressive advocacy organizations\u2014said in a statement Thursday that \u201call eyes are now on Senate Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe call on Majority Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans to make the right move,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cStop enabling President Trump and immediately pass $3.6 billion in safe election funding and reforms, in addition to the $25 billion needed to keep the post office up and running.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet.org", "title": "'A five alarm fire': The GOP is Trump's accomplice as he works to sabotage the election", "url": "https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/a-five-alarm-fire-the-gop-is-trumps-accomplice-as-he-works-to-sabotage-the-election/", "type": "article", "description": "Voting rights advocates on Thursday took aim at Republicans in Congress for remaining silent in the face of President Donald Trump's open admission that he is blocking funding for the U.S. Postal Service with the express purpose of stopping an expansion of mail-in ballot access ahead of the November", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.alternet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/49499001842_c8b03baa69_o.jpg", "url": "https://www.alternet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/49499001842_c8b03baa69_o.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.alternet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/49499001842_c8b03baa69_o.jpg"}, "updated_time": "2020-08-14T01:57:48+00:00"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T01:57:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T01:57:48+00:00"}, "twitter": {"title": "'A five alarm fire': The GOP is Trump's accomplice as he works to sabotage the election", "url": "https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/a-five-alarm-fire-the-gop-is-trumps-accomplice-as-he-works-to-sabotage-the-election/", "description": "Voting rights advocates on Thursday took aim at Republicans in Congress for remaining silent in the face of President Donald Trump's open admission that he is blocking funding for the U.S. Postal Service with the express purpose of stopping an expansion of mail-in ballot access ahead of the November", "image": "https://www.alternet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/49499001842_c8b03baa69_o.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}}}}
