I can tell you Building 13 is not a cell block or punishment area, but rather a housing area, where 200 other inmates are located,\u201d Pulchan told Guardian Media.\n\n\u201cThere was no malice in moving him from point A to point B. I spoke with Mr. Ali this morning (Thursday) and everything was amicable,\u201d claimed Pulchan.\n\nPulchan said there was no real reason for moving Mr. Ali.\n\nThe Islamic Front indicated as well that Ali\u2019s attorneys also were taking issue with the commissioner for his failure to implement proper COVID-19 protocols at the Port of Spain Prison, where a prisoner tested positive for the virus a few days ago.\n\n\u201cWe are doing everything to fight COVID-19 inside the prisons. We are making masks for prisoners so they can be protected,\u201d Pulchan said.\n\nThe Islamic Front also has called on Prime Minister Dr. Keith Rowley, and Police Commissioner Gary Griffith, to respond to this matter.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 6.1.4 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface.", "fb": {"pages": 126206357995}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.cnc3.co.tt/prisons-commissioner-clears-air-on-ali-move/?ia_markup=1"}, "og": {"url": "https://www.cnc3.co.tt/prisons-commissioner-clears-air-on-ali-move/", "type": "article", "title": "Prisons Commissioner clears air on Ali move", "description": "Prisons Commissioner Dennis Pulchan has cleared up the misconception about the transfer of inmate Rajaee Ali from Remand Yard in Maximum Security Prison (MSP) to Building 13, after allegations were levelled against him by the Waajihatul Islaamiyyah (The Islamic Front), in a media release on Thursday.", "image": "https://www.cnc3.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DENNIS-PULCHAN-PRISON-COMMISSIONER-1.jpg"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i2.wp.com/www.cnc3.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cropped-CNC3-FLAT-HD-Randall-e1577116872887.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["Covid In Prisions Mentioned"]}}
