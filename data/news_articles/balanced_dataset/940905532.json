It is alarming that so little appears to have changed after so many avoidable deaths and provides further evidence of the need for fundamental reform.\"\n\nThe report says that those previously graded Weak, ten have improved but ten have not.\n\nOf those previously graded as Adequate, five have improved but seven have deteriorated and ten remained the same.\n\nCommon Weal director Robin McAlpine said: \u201cThere is a very real risk that care homes are treated as old news. If people knew that in the last few months as many care homes have deteriorated rapidly as have improved there would be great public concern.\n\n\"We must never behave as if this issues has gone away because it most certainly has not. Some of our most vulnerable citizens continue to suffer unnecessarily and we must never lose our focus on trying not only to keep them safe but to ensure they have a decent quality of life.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Revealed - The scale of \"hasty\" move of elderly from hospital to Scots care homes over coronavirus\n\nMr Kempe's separate Predictable Crisis analysis has traced the roots of the pandemic crisis care homes to the early 1990s, privatisation policies and the big financial interests profiting from them.\n\nThe report argues that the tragedy was not only predictable but clearly predicted and that the deeply flawed Scottish Government response in the first eight weeks of the crisis led directly to many unnecessary deaths.\n\nIt points to the SNP's failure to make the preparations detailed in Operation Cygnus, a 2016 NHS pandemic planning exercise that highlighted the necessity of beefing up the social care system in particular.\n\nIt said that based on quality ratings at the outset of the crisis more than one quarter of Scotland's care homes - those rated adequate or below - could have been expected to be unable properly to protect older people in the event of a pandemic.\n\nHe accepted that the Care Inspectorate does a professional job but has few enforcement powers and works inside a regulatory regime which is very limited in scope.\n\nAs an example, in February, he says, they simply did not have the power to do what has now eventually been done at the Home Farm Care Home on Skye - where 10 residents died from coronavirus.\n\nThe Care Inspectorate is still seeking to remove HC-One as the care provider at Home Farm after an inspection identified \u201cserious and significant concerns\u201d about the quality of care. .\n\nMr Kempe's analysis said the Care Inspectorate was incapable of bringing Care Homes up to the standard required by the Covid crisis and poor quality care was embedded in the system.\n\nThe Care Inspectorate declined to comment.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "OMG-Verify-V1": "4389-366acdfc-5224-4c07-bb70-f74d8fbfc2db", "og": {"url": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18652891.new-alarm-covid-control-scotlands-care-homes/", "site_name": "HeraldScotland", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11433545/", "width": 1200, "height": 906}, "title": "New alarm over Covid control in care homes after Scots death toll dubbed 'single greatest devolved government failure'", "type": "website", "name": "New alarm over Covid control in care homes after Scots death toll dubbed 'single greatest devolved government failure'", "description": "NEW concerns about the pace of improvement on coronavirus infection in Scotland's care homes has emerged after a series of failures led to a death\u2026"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11433545/"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "New alarm over Covid control in care homes after Scots death toll dubbed 'single greatest devolved government failure'", "description": "NEW concerns about the pace of improvement on coronavirus infection in Scotland's care homes has emerged after a series of failures led to a death\u2026"}, "fb": {"app_id": 612240812916784, "pages": 285985008233564}, "medium": "news", "title": "New alarm over Covid control in care homes after Scots death toll dubbed 'single greatest devolved government failure'", "description": "NEW concerns about the pace of improvement on coronavirus infection in Scotland's care homes has emerged after a series of failures led to a death\u2026"}}}
