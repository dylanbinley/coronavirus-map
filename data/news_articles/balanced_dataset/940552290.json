energy exploration bid in waters Athens claims as its own.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkey accused Greece and the island nation of Cyprus of encroaching on its rights in the Mediterranean.\n\nIt has vowed to defend its interests in the region but also called for dialogue to resolve the dispute.\n\nExpand Close French President Emmanuel Macron has been hailed as a \u2018true friend of Greece\u2019 (Daniel

countered that it is entitled to conduct research in the area.\n\nGreece placed its military on alert and sent warships to the area off Turkey\u2019s southern coast.\n\nExpand Close Turkey President

Turkish coast and 369 miles from the Greek mainland.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have designs on anyone\u2019s rights, but we won\u2019t let any country take away our rights.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish
