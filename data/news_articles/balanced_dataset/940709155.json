Another women, aged 43, was also arrested at Mullumbimby, near Byron Bay, shortly afterwards.\n\nThey have been charged with Ms Lovell\u2019s negligent manslaughter.\n\nCoroner Peter White in 2016 found the 36-year-old died after losing a lot of blood giving birth to a healthy baby girl in a pool.\n\nShe gave birth in the dark and was left in the water for at least an hour without proper examination.\n\nMs Lovell lost consciousness temporarily before begging for an ambulance because she thought she was dying.\n\nCamera Icon Gaye Demanuele. Credit: supplied\n\nMr White found former midwife Gaye Demanuele \u201cacted quite as she pleased\u201d and ignored the pleas until the mother eventually collapsed.\n\nMs Demanuele, who later de-registered herself as a midwife, was assisted at the birth by Melody Bourne and a doula.\n\nMs Lovell suffered a post-partum haemorrhage before dying in hospital, leaving behind her newborn daughter and an older girl.\n\nMr White referred the case to the Director of Public Prosecutions, saying her death was avoidable and Ms Demanuele\u2019s inadequate management contributed.\n\nMs Lovell had told Ms Demanuele she believed she had suffered a tear during her first child\u2019s delivery. But Ms Demanuele did not seek relevant medical records from the hospital involved or consult with the woman\u2019s GP, according to the inquest.\n\nShe didn\u2019t create a safe environment, with the dark room making it hard to see what had happened to the mother, and misled attending paramedics and the hospital, Mr White said.\n\nThe two women charged will appear in Melbourne Magistrates Court on August 21.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "AAB93AFA533AEBE913449C2EE9895627", "msapplication-config": "https://www.perthnow.com.au/static/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "PerthNow", "url": "https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/vic/two-women-charged-after-homebirth-death-of-melbourne-woman-caroline-emily-lovell-ng-b881639070z", "title": "Duo charged over homebirth death", "description": "Two women have been charged with negligent manslaughter after a 36-year-old woman died during a homebirth more than eight years ago.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.s.perthnow.com.au/publication/B881639070Z/1597389244248_GO62SOPKU.2-2.JPG?imwidth=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 574, "alt": "Caroline Lovell"}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Duo charged over homebirth death", "description": "Two women have been charged with negligent manslaughter after a 36-year-old woman died during a homebirth more than eight years ago.", "site": "PerthNow", "image": "https://images.s.perthnow.com.au/publication/B881639070Z/1597389244248_GO62SOPKU.2-2.JPG?imwidth=1024"}, "description": "Two women have been charged with negligent manslaughter after a 36-year-old woman died during a homebirth more than eight years ago.", "fb": {"app_id": 1392885797487365, "pages": 92409946191}, "article": {"publisher": "PerthNow", "published_time": "2020-08-14T06:28:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T07:14:08.043Z", "section": "News", "tag": "News,VIC News,News,Health,News,Courts & Justice"}, "keywords": "News,VIC News,News,Health,News,Courts & Justice", "news_keywords": "News,VIC News,News,Health,News,Courts & Justice"}}}
