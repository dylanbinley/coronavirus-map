(Image courtesy of Osisko Gold Royalties\n\nOsisko Gold Royalties has entered into a definitive agreement with Quebec\u2019s Caisse de depot et placement to acquire an outstanding 15% interest in a portfolio of Canadian precious metals royalties for C$12.5 million, funded by cash on hand. This 15% interest is the remaining portion of a portfolio originally purchased from Teck Resources in 2015.\n\nThe purchase includes 28 royalties on properties in Canada and includes increased interests on revenues derived from Alamos Gold\u2019s Island Gold mine and Eldorado Gold\u2019s Lamaque mine. Both of these assets have planned expansions and the two operations contributed an estimated 3,000 gold-equivalent oz. to Osisko last year.\n\n\u201cThis transaction increases Osisko\u2019s ownership in a quality royalty portfolio of Canadian assets and adds immediate cash flow on premium assets, such as the Island Gold and Lamaque mines,\u201d Sean Roosen, the company\u2019s chairman and CEO, said in a release.\n\nWith this transaction, Osisko\u2019s royalty interests on the Island Gold mine have increased to between 1.38% and 3%, from 1.17% to 2.55% previously. In addition, the company\u2019s interest in revenues from the Lamaque mine is now at 1%, up from 0.85% previously. On the pre-production side, Osisko now has a 0.5% NSR (net smelter royalty) on O3 Mining\u2019s Marban property, up from 0.425% with an associated commercial production payment increased to C$5 million, from C$4.25 million.\n\nAdditional royalties on exploration and development properties have increased by approximately 18%.\n\nThe Caisse has an equity stake in Osisko Royalties.\n\nOsisko Gold Royalties is a royalty company focused on precious metals in the Americas and holds 135 royalties, streams and precious metal offtakes. Its cornerstone asset is a 5% NSR on the Canadian Malartic mine.\n\nThe company also holds the Cariboo gold project in B.C. and holds stakes in resource companies, including a 14.7% interest in Osisko Mining, an 18.6% stake in Osisko Metals and a 19% ownership of Minera Alamos.\n\n(This article first appeared in the Canadian Mining Journal)", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ms-icon-310x310-300x300.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 843861445981796}, "og": {"url": "https://www.mining.com/osisko-royalties-grows-canadian-portfolio/", "type": "article", "title": "Osisko Royalties grows Canadian portfolio - MINING.COM", "description": "Company has entered into a definitive agreement with Quebec\u2019s Caisse de depot et placement to acquire an outstanding 15% interest in a portfolio of Canadian precious metals royalties for C$12.5 million, funded by cash on hand.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/osisko-gold-grabs-orions-metals-portfolio-in-1-13-billion-deal.jpg", "width": 900, "height": 585}, "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "MINING.COM"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@MINING.COM", "creator": "@MiningDotCom", "title": "Osisko Royalties grows Canadian portfolio", "description": "Company has entered into a definitive agreement with Quebec\u2019s Caisse de depot et placement to acquire an outstanding 15% interest in a portfolio of Canadian precious metals royalties for C$12.5 million, funded by cash on hand.", "image": "https://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/osisko-gold-grabs-orions-metals-portfolio-in-1-13-billion-deal.jpg"}, "description": "Company has entered into a definitive agreement with Quebec\u2019s Caisse de depot et placement to acquire an outstanding 15% interest in a portfolio of Canadian precious metals royalties for C$12.5 million, funded by cash on hand.", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/miningdotcom/", "published_time": "2020-08-14T18:47:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T18:47:59+00:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2"}}}
