"Former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell on Thursday said that presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris wanted to make Washington D.C. the \u201ccapital of the world\u201d when it comes to how U.S. money is spent abroad.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cThe clear fact is that the Biden/Harris team want Washington to be the capital of the world and Donald Trump wants Washington to be the capital of the United States and fight for the American people,\u201d Grenell, a former U.S. ambassador to Germany, said on \u201cCavuto: Coast to Coast.\u201d\n\nBIDEN TWEETS THAT OBAMA WH LEFT TRUMP 'PLAYBOOK' ON PANDEMICS, GRENELL RESPONDS\n\nGrenell was drawing a contrast between the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to international issues and the more internationalist approach carried out by the Obama administration and that he believes will continue under a potential Biden administration.\n\nHe said that that applies not only to relations, but also how taxpayer money is spent.\n\n\u201cWe should be clear we will always help but we will always have strings,\u201d he said. \u201cU.S. money should not be free, there should always be strings and that what the Biden approach has been -- it\u2019s always been about consensus, give the money, try your best but keep giving the money and we've been taken advantage of.\u201d\n\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES 'HISTORIC PEACE AGREEMENT' BETWEEN ISRAEL, UAE\n\nHe spoke after the White House announced what Trump called a \u201chistoric peace agreement\u201d between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, saying they agreed to \u201cfull normalization of relations.\u201d\n\nGrenell also said he agreed with President Trump\u2019s move to scale back the U.S. troop presence in Germany, saying the situation was radically different from how it was after World War II.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cGermany is the largest economy in Europe, it has a surplus, maybe we shouldnt be footing the bill for the Germans when they're not paying their bill at NATO,\u201d he said.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0,
