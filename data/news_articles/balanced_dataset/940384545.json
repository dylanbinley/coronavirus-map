On August 10, the Pervomaisky District Court in Bishkek ordered Abdullaev held by the security agency until September 8.\n\n\n\n\u201cGiven the risk of torture Abdullaev faces in Uzbekistan if he is sent back, Kyrgyzstan\u2019s prosecutor general should refuse the Uzbek authorities\u2019 request,\u201d said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cKyrgyz authorities know that under international law, they are barred from returning anyone to a place where they would likely be tortured or persecuted for their political beliefs or exercise of their basic rights.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbdullaev, 47, has written for Fergana News Agency, the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR), and other media outlets. Abdullaev travelled to Kyrgyzstan in February for a four-month study program at the American University in Central Asia.\n\n\n\nGKNB officials have not permitted Abdullaev\u2019s lawyers to meet with their client since the hearing. Nevertheless, Timur Sultanov, one of Abdullaev\u2019s lawyers, told Human Rights Watch that they plan to appeal the detention order, and on August 12, they filed an asylum claim with the Kyrgyz authorities on their client\u2019s behalf. On August 12, GKNB officials told Natalya Kotik, another of Abdullaev\u2019s lawyers, that her client had been placed under quarantine for 14 days and \u201cthey will not let the lawyers meet Abdullaev.\u201d Kotik told Human Rights Watch that the officials did not specify why Abdullaev needed to be in quarantine.\n\n\n\nAccording to local news reports, Abdullaev is wanted by the Uzbek authorities in connection with social media posts allegedly written under the pen name \u201cQora Mergan\u201d [Black Shooter] that are critical of Uzbekistan\u2019s president. Abdullaev has denied that he has any connection to writings by \u201cQora Mergan.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is not Abdullaev\u2019s first run-in with Uzbek authorities, Human Rights Watch said.\n\n\n\nUzbek authorities arrested Abdullaev in September 2017 on charges of attempting to overthrow Uzbekistan\u2019s constitutional order for writing \u201cextremist\u201d articles and being part of a conspiracy to overthrow the government.\n\n\n\nIn May 2018, a Tashkent city court convicted Abdullaev of \u201cinfringing the country\u2019s constitutional order,\u201d sentenced him to three years of community service, and ordered him to pay 20 percent of his income to the government over the same period. For time served in pretrial detention, his sentence was reduced to one-and-a-half years.\n\n\n\nAbdullaev alleged that he was tortured in pretrial detention, but Uzbek authorities refused to investigate his claims. Although Uzbekistan has made some improvements in its human rights record in recent years, torture and ill-treatment in detention continue to be a widespread and serious problem.\n\n\n\nIn November 2019, the United Nations Committee Against Torture found that in Uzbekistan, \u201ctorture and ill-treatment continue to be routinely committed by, at the instigation of, and with the consent of the State party\u2019s law enforcement, investigative and prison officials, principally for the purpose of extracting confessions or information to be used in criminal proceedings.\u201d The committee also expressed concern over continued reports that judges and prosecutors \u201ctend to disregard and decline to investigate\u201d allegations that confessions were obtained through torture.\n\n\n\nIn the past, Human Rights Watch has documented the use of torture in detention in Uzbekistan, including beatings with rubber truncheons and water-filled bottles, electric shock, hanging by wrists and ankles, rape and sexual humiliation, asphyxiation with plastic bags and gas masks, threats of physical harm to relatives, and denial of food or water.\n\n\n\nThere is a near-total lack of accountability for torture in Uzbekistan, Human Rights Watch said.\n\n\n\nInternational law explicitly prohibits refoulement, the forcible return of a refugee to a place where they would most likely face persecution or of any person to a country where they would face torture.\n\n\n\nDeporting Abdullaev to Uzbekistan would violate Kyrgyzstan\u2019s obligations under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which it ratified in 1997. Article 3 of the convention includes an absolute prohibition on extraditing or returning anyone to a place where they risk being tortured. As a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, Kyrgyzstan is obligated not to return asylum seekers to a place where they face a serious risk of being persecuted.\n\n\n\n\u201cAbdullaev already endured torture at the hands of Uzbek officials once,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cKyrgyz authorities should ensure that it doesn\u2019t happen again and protect Abdullaev from forced return to Uzbekistan, as is his right under international law.\u201d", "METADATA": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Rights Watch", "url": "https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/08/12/kyrgyzstan-dont-return-asylum-seeker-uzbekistan", "title": "Kyrgyzstan: Don\u2019t Return Asylum Seeker to Uzbekistan", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/multimedia_images_2018/201805eca_uzbekistan_abdullaevreleased.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/multimedia_images_2018/201805eca_uzbekistan_abdullaevreleased.jpg", "alt": "Bobomurod Abdullaev, May 7, 2018."}, "updated_time": "2020-08-14T22:45:51-0400"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kyrgyzstan: Don\u2019t Return Asylum Seeker to Uzbekistan", "site": {"identifier": "@hrw", "id": 14700316}, "image": "https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/multimedia_images_2018/201805eca_uzbekistan_abdullaevreleased.jpg"}, "description": "Kyrgyz authorities should reject a request to extradite the independent Uzbek journalist Bobomurod Abdullaev to Uzbekistan and instead should release him, Human Rights Watch said today.", "google-site-verification": "H_DzcJuJMJKVAO6atlPsK4HHr2WienspT6e74P5fVFY", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HumanRightsWatch", "published_time": "2020-08-12T08:00:00-0400", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T22:45:51-0400"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}}}
