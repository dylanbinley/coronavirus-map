Police reform is a critically important topic, not only in Springfield, but also nationally, and I look forward to sharing my best thinking with him, based on many years as a public defender, lawyer, judge, and student of the law. The citizens of Springfield deserve a law enforcement agency which they can trust, and which follows the rule of law and our Constitution.\"\n\nIreland retired from the bench in 2014.\n\nIn 2017, he was a special advisor to the Speaker of the Masschusetts House on criminal justice reform. In 2018, he was hired by the city of Cambridge to do a review of the police department's arrest procedures.", "METADATA": {"og": {"description": "A retired Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court will advise Springfield\u2019s mayor on police reforms.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.wamc.org/sites/wamc/files/styles/medium/public/202008/Roderick_Ireland_undatedphoto.jpg", "height": 955, "width": 1280}, "url": "https://www.wamc.org/post/retired-massachusetts-chief-justice-consult-police-reforms-springfield", "type": "article", "title": "Retired Massachusetts Chief Justice To Consult On Police Reforms In Springfield"}, "dc": {"title": "Retired Massachusetts Chief Justice To Consult On Police Reforms In Springfield"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@ptuthill", "site": "@WAMCRadio", "card": "summary"}, "datePublished": "2020-08-13", "has_audio": 1, "programs": "none", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "category": "New England News", "nid": 232854, "wordCount": 419, "story_id": 902236871, "keywords": "Springfield Police Department, Roderick Ireland", "org_id": 0, "author": "Paul Tuthill", "description": "A retired Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court will advise Springfield\u2019s mayor on police reforms.", "viewport": "width=device-width"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
