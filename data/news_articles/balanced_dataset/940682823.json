Other African countries represented a cumulative 26,801 visitors.\n\nTopping arrivals from Europe were France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom; while other major source markets from elsewhere in the world were Brazil and China.\n\nMinister Shifeta underscored the need for Namibia and the region to rethink tourism packages for the sake of the sector\u2019s sustainability.\n\n\u201cThere might be a need to look at whether we are pushing the correct tourism product that will allow us to breathe life into the sector especially this time of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThere is a need to look at the potential to tap into regional and local tourism because the effects of the pandemic are real and might stay longer than usual,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile noting that arrivals from Southern African countries were on the rise, Minister Shifeta said there was still a long way to go before intra-regional tourism started contributing a significant proportion of tourism receipts.\n\nHe said with the right cocktail of measures, domestic and regional tourism had potential to make huge contributions to GDP.\n\n\u201cBased on the analysis, Namibia needs to keep the momentum for the further development of tourism, to move away from seasonal destinations into an all-year destination.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it\u2019s advisable for all stakeholders to increase their efforts towards making Namibia a preferential destination,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n0\n\nLike us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Subscribe Daily Newsletter\n\nRelated Stories", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"type": "website", "title": "Nam Reaps benefits of domestic tourism || The Southern Times", "url": "https://southerntimesafrica.com/site/news/nam-reaps-benefits-of-domestic-tourism", "site_name": "maxebooking.com", "image": "https://southerntimesafrica.com/uploads/download_-_2020-08-14T042600_291.jpg"}}}}
