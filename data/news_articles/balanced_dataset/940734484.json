By the late 1960s, quite alarmingly from a Soviet point of view, Jewish and Ukrainian \u00e9migr\u00e9s had begun to rally together in defense of human rights activists and dissidents in the USSR. By propagating stories about \u201cthousands\u201d of Nazis supposedly hiding within North America\u2019s Ukrainian and Baltic communities Moscow\u2019s men deliberately and effectively fragmented this common front.\n\nThese KGB covert operations were outlined candidly in a now-declassified memorandum, analyzed by Prof. Olga Bertelsen, as published in 2020 in the respected International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence.\n\nOn October 18, 1985, Stepan Mukha, head of Soviet Ukraine\u2019s Committee of State Security, addressed Volodymyr Shcher\u00adbytsky, first secretary of the Communist Party of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Following consultations with his Russian KGB counterparts, Comrade Mukha wrote, his operatives so effectively deployed their \u201coperational capabilities\u201d that Washington was \u201ccompelled\u201d to create an Office of Special Investigations within the Department of Justice in 1979. To further shape general opinion, polemical tracts denigrating the Ukrainian nationalist movement were circulated widely, including the American Communist Party leader Michael Hanusiak\u2019s \u201cLest We Forget.\u201d It was reissued twice. Even I got a copy.\n\n\u201cConsidering the positive evolution\u201d of Operation Payback in America, measures \u201caimed at unfolding a similar campaign in Canada were implemented\u201d in 1980-1985. Materials about the alleged wartime criminality of the Galicia Division were \u201cplanted\u201d in the Toronto Star with the resulting outrage stoked until, this spymaster claimed, Ottawa was \u201cforced\u201d to establish the Commission of Inquiry on War Criminals, headed by Justice Jules Desch\u00eanes, in February 1985. All this skullduggery obliged the Ukrainian Canadian community to \u201cdivert efforts and funds\u201d to its own defense, weakening its capacity for otherwise challenging Soviet narratives and behavior. I know this is true. I was there.\n\nHow many stories were planted? The Desch\u00eanes Commission\u2019s final report listed several dozen articles about \u201cNazi war criminals in Canada.\u201d For example, Irwin Cotler, as reported in the Ottawa Citizen on July 13, 1981, said \u201cat least 100\u201d Nazis were amongst us, a number he inflated to \u201cmaybe 1,000\u201d for La Presse on April 13, 1983. On the pages of the Toronto Star on June 18, 1982, David Matas gave a figure of 50-60; he was outdone by Sol Littman, the Canadian representative of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, who touted the figure of 3,000 on November 8, 1984, repeating this for the Toronto Star on January 25, 1985. After reviewing all these claims, Justice Desch\u00eanes observed: \u201cOutside interveners concerning alleged war criminals residing in Canada have spread increasingly large and grossly exaggerated figures as to their estimated number.\u201d\n\nAfter also carefully studying the wartime history of the Galicia Division, the Desch\u00eanes Commission concluded it should not be indicted as a group; that members of the division were individually screened for security purposes before admission to Canada; that charges of war crimes against members of the division had never been substantiated, either in 1950 when they were first preferred, or in 1984 when they were renewed, or before the commission, and that, in the absence of participation in, or knowledge of, specific war crimes, mere membership in the Galicia Division was insufficient to justify prosecution. Finally, the commission noted that no case could be made against members of the Galicia Division for revocation of citizenship or deportation since the Canadian authorities were fully aware of the relevant facts in 1950 and admission to Canada was not granted because of any false representation, or fraud, or concealment of material circumstances.\n\nDespite these rather definitive findings, allegations about the Galicia Division have sporadically been resuscitated. In October 2017, Kiril Kalinin, operating out of the Russian Embassy in Ottawa, circulated mendacious tales about Chrystia Freeland, then Canada\u2019s minister of foreign affairs, while tweeting provocative statements about imagined \u201cNazi war memorials\u201d in Canada. After his subterfuges were exposed Mr. Kalinin was declared persona non grata and expelled.\n\nTellingly, the annual report of the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians identifies the Russian Federation as a \u201cprimary threat actor\u201d conducting foreign interference activities in Canada. Yet there are journalists who studiously ignore this geopolitical reality, not to mention the findings of the Desch\u00eanes Commission, preferring to re-spew the concocted, hateful and divisive fables Comrade Mukha and his minions spread, starting decades ago. Distracting attention from Russia\u2019s ongoing war against Ukraine and the fascistic agenda of the KGB man in the Kremlin seem to be the goals of the current disinformation campaign. One hopes Canada\u2019s security and intelligence services will help counter those who seek to riven what remains of the Free World.\n\nHooligans scuttle about in the dark and destroy private property. Their ilk, who desecrate cemetery monuments or spray-paint community memorials, are best left for the police to round up. As for anyone who turns a blind eye to criminal vandalism, or tries to justify a hate crime, I recommend the words of the evangelist (Matthew 7:5) \u2013 \u201cYou hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother\u2019s eye.\u201d\n\nLubomyr Luciuk is a professor of political geography at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "og": {"title": "\u201cOperation Payback\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.ukrweekly.com/uwwp/operation-payback/", "description": "We always suspected it.
