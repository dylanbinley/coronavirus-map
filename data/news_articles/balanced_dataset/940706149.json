I join my American colleagues and leaders around the world in fully supporting your resistance movement and your drive for a free Iran.\n\nThe wind is truly at your back. The momentum shift just in the past year is significant and dramatic. We can see it. We can feel it. The United States government maximum pressure campaign is working. The regime is much weaker, more isolated, and more vulnerable than at any time in the 40-year tyrannical rule of the Iranian regime. Civil unrest and uprisings are taking place not just in Tehran, but throughout the country through different socioeconomic groups. The people are holding the mullahs responsible for what is happening. Tragically, 1,500 Iranian people were killed demonstrating against the regime in November alone.\n\nThe regime funding support for foreign wars in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Afghanistan, is less than what it used to be. The architect of those wars and the regime\u2019s number one terrorist, Qassem Soleimani, is dead. The momentum is gaining. We can see it, we can feel it.\n\nThe regime has mismanaged the coronavirus with an inadequate hospital infrastructure and a lack of vital supplies and equipment. And of course, predictably, they lied about it.\n\nThe people of Behbahan, an oil rich region of Iran, were in the streets chanting: \u201cShame on you Khamenei, leave our country alone. No to Gaza. No to Lebanon. We sacrifice our lives for Iran.\u201d Nothing is more inspiring than to see every day people willing to die for freedom. I\u2019m always in awe of it. These brave people don\u2019t want to die, but what makes them so special is they are willing to.\n\nWe in America are inspired by Iranian people\u2019s raw courage and by Maryam Rajavi\u2019s leadership. The momentum is gaining. We can see it. We can feel it. I say to you, my dear Iranian friends, in the words of your own people, mullahs get lost. Free Iran, free Iran.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.
