The legislation will now be in place until at least 15 September, but opposition leader John Steenhuisen isn\u2019t happy with the alleged influence of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.\n\nJohn Steenhuisen slams Dlamini-Zuma for \u2018approving State of Disaster\u2019\n\nThe COGTA Minister \u2013 who has been accused of usurping Cyril Ramaphosa to \u2018call the shots\u2019 in government \u2013 is the politician who signed off on the extension this weekend. Rather than the document being signed by the president, it is Dlamini-Zuma\u2019s signature that appears at the bottom of the page.\n\nSteenhuisen hinted that this was an ominous development for South Africa, suggesting that NDZ would be leading the lockdown response rather than Ramaphosa. This sardonic Tweet was posted earlier on Saturday:\n\nThere you have it, can see where this is heading\u2026 pic.twitter.com/xxV5rzepqh \u2014 John Steenhuisen MP (@jsteenhuisen) August 15, 2020\n\nDA fume over possible \u2018looting orgies\u2019\n\nHe isn\u2019t the only senior DA figure upset with these developments. Dean Macpherson, the shadow trade minister, claims that Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s government has extended the State of Disaster \u2018to help grease the wheels of corruption\u2019. The politician implied that this is an opportunity \u2018to loot more cash for another 30 days.\u2019\n\nLeon Schreiber, also part of the shadow cabinet, predicted that a \u2018looting orgy\u2019 was on the cards for the ANC.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all seen how the State of Disaster has facilitated the latest ANC looting orgy. It is time to ask whether this extension of another 30 days is explicitly designed by Ramaphosa to continue the ANC feeding frenzy?\u201d Leon Schreiber\n\nIt is looking increasingly likely that a wave of lockdown changes will be implemented on Saturday night, with South Africa possibly moving forward into Level 2 for the first time. You can catch Ramaphosa\u2019s speech here, and it expected to begin at 20:00. \u2018Fellow South Africans\u2019, there could be some good news ahead.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "The State of Disaster laws have been extended.
