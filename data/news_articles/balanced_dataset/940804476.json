We have an active foreign policy and we will make our own sovereign decisions.\"\n\n- No back-stabbers -\n\nOman and Bahrain have welcomed the announcement as advancing the prospects for peace in the Middle East.\n\nBut Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stressed the deal did not mean Israel was abandoning its plans to one day annex the Jordan Valley and Jewish settlements across the occupied West Bank.\n\n\"The primary gain is to take annexation out of the equation for the time being,\" Ghobash said.\n\nThe minister rejected criticism from the Palestinians, saying there was \"no other plan on the table from our Arab side to suggest that some solution might be forthcoming\".\n\n\"I am trying to understand in what sense this is a back stab given that what we have done is actually open the door for a rethink on the Israeli side about annexation,\" he said.\n\n\"We strongly believe in the rights of the Palestinians' cause and the rights of the Palestinians,\" said Ghobash.\n\n\"So we have taken the step in accordance with these deeply held beliefs but also in accordance with the new reading of the region.\"\n\nIn 2002, Saudi Arabia sponsored the Arab Peace Initiative which called for Israel's complete withdrawal from occupied territories in exchange for peace and full normalisation of relations.\n\n\"We are now in 2020, so 18 years have passed and we haven't seen any outcome from the Arab Peace Initiative.\n\n\"We believe that the way in which we should approach these questions is by dialogue and communication,\" Ghobash said.\n\n\u00a9 2020 AFP", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/3fa4f8ae-de4a-11ea-8607-005056a964fe/w:1280/p:16x9/eedefae6fc027879967ebc1f289604fa07a31ac0.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "RFI", "type": "article", "title": "UAE defends Israel deal as 'shake-up' of tired Mideast diplomacy - RFI", "description": "UAE defends Israel deal as 'shake-up' of tired Mideast diplomacy", "url": "https://www.rfi.fr/en/wires/20200814-uae-defends-israel-deal-shake-tired-mideast-diplomacy"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113191652055439, "pages": 28764872018}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RFI.English/", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/RFI.English/", "published_time": "2020-08-14T16:06:34+00:00"}, "description": "UAE defends Israel deal as 'shake-up' of tired Mideast diplomacy", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@RFI_En"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "RFI", "application-name": "RFI", "msapplication-TileColor": "#e2001a", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
