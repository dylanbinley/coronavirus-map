Time to fight Florida\u2019s school reopening order is elapsing.", "TEXT": "Supporters of an online-only restart to school aren\u2019t giving up without a fight, even though it\u2019s looking like an increasingly uphill battle. Pasco County district employees asked a local judge to intervene in their district\u2019s reopening plan, hoping the limited nature of their complaint might yield quick results. Some Hillsborough County School Board members who voted to delay in-person classes for four weeks, meanwhile, said they\u2019d stick to their convictions, regardless of possible state sanctions. Other efforts continue. But time is running short, as more students are set to go back to \u201cbricks and mortar\u201d next week. Read on for the latest.\n\nThe Florida constitution mandates a \u201csafe, secure and high quality system of public education.\u201d Lawyers for the United School Employees of Pasco argue that reopening during COVID-19 would violate the safe and secure part.\n\nState officials continue to press Hillsborough County to offer in-person classes beginning Aug. 24. They signaled they\u2019re working with district leaders toward a solution. Some School Board members still need convincing. \u2022 In a Wednesday evening televised speech, Gov. Ron DeSantis likened the state\u2019s reopening effort to a Navy SEAL team operation, Florida Politics reports.\n\nWhat\u2019s the driving safety issue?

It gets another scheduling hearing this morning in Leon County. Watch here.\n\nFinding solutions to meet everyone\u2019s needs isn\u2019t easy. District officials must make decisions affecting neighborhoods that have experienced the coronavirus in very different ways, TC Palm reports. \u2022 They do so under state scrutiny, and not just in Hillsborough. Palm Beach County school officials thought they had a way to return safely to classrooms, but replaced the plan after the state rejected it, the Palm Beach Post reports. \u2022 Volusia County School Board members are asking the state for some waivers and added direction to help them prepare, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reports.\n\nSome teachers still want to teach solely virtual classes. Being asked for personal medical information to justify the request isn\u2019t going over well in Clay County, Clay Today reports. \u2022 Brevard County teachers who contract the virus won\u2019t have their names revealed, Florida Today reports.\n\nIf they don\u2019t feel safe, some teachers might not come back.

Leon County teachers asked to wear scrubs in class, and the district agreed, the Tallahassee Democrat reports.\n\nReaching agreement on working conditions is critical.

Here\u2019s a link to yesterday\u2019s roundup, just in case.\n\nBefore you go ... President Trump held an event Wednesday to talk about reopening schools.
