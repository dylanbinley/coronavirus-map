(\"APUC\") (TSX: AQN) (NYSE: AQN) announced today that the Board of Directors has declared a dividend of U.S. $0.1551 per share on its common shares, payable on October 15, 2020, to the shareholders of record on September 30, 2020, for the period from July 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020. Shareholders receiving dividends in cash can elect to receive the dividend in Canadian dollars in the amount of C$0.2056.\n\nThe common share dividend will be paid in cash or, if a shareholder has enrolled in the shareholder dividend reinvestment plan (the \"Plan\"), dividends will be reinvested in additional common shares (\"Plan Shares\") of APUC as per the Plan.

Registered shareholders receive dividend payments in the currency of residency. Registered shareholders may opt to change the payment currency by contacting AST Trust Company (Canada) at 1-800-387-0825 prior to the record date of the dividend.\n\nThe Canadian dollar equivalent of the quarterly dividend is based on the Bank of Canada daily average exchange rate on the day before the declaration date.\n\nAbout Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp.\n\nAPUC is a diversified international generation, transmission, and distribution utility with approximately $11 billion of total assets.
