Distance offers better protection than face masks,\u2019\u2019 Hoie said.\n\nThe face mask recommendation was initially to be in effect for 14 days and applied for travel within Oslo, and journeys to and from Oslo and parts of the south-western Ostfold region where case numbers have risen.\n\nThe Norwegian Institute of Public Health that provided guidelines said it did not recommend the use of face masks at schools or kindergartens.\n\nNorway has had relatively low infection rates but has seen increasing case numbers in recent weeks.\n\nThe Scandinavian country had on Friday recorded 261 coronavirus-related deaths and 9,850 infections.\n\nAnother Nordic country, Finland, on Thursday recommended citizens wear face masks when using public transport or in crowded spaces.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTelegram\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nSkype\n\nPrint\n\nPocket\n\nWhatsApp\n\nMore\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "uw2qPv_daOnUudnLcO6hjVitB8h5oyN0ua07c8ir0ws", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/naija247news.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6600A37D-57B0-40DD-9ACE-E1563DAB56FF.jpeg?fit=450%2C300&ssl=1", "width": 450, "height": 300}, "type": "article", "title": "Norway urges commuters in capital region to wear face masks", "url": "https://naija247news.com/2020/08/14/norway-urges-commuters-in-capital-region-to-wear-face-masks/", "description": "Stockholm, Aug. 14, 2020 Norway on Friday recommended commuters using public transport to wear face masks during rush hours in the capital region of Oslo in a bid to stem the spread of coronavirus.\u2026", "site_name": "Naija247news", "locale": "en_US"}, "author": "Naija247news.com", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T18:18:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T18:18:41+00:00"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@Naija247new", "site": "@naija247new", "text": {"title": "Norway urges commuters in capital region to wear face masks"}, "image": "https://i2.wp.com/naija247news.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6600A37D-57B0-40DD-9ACE-E1563DAB56FF.jpeg?fit=450%2C300&ssl=1&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i1.wp.com/naija247news.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cropped-InstaLogo.jpg?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1", "yandex-verification": "9b42f3633098159b", "fb": {"pages": 183141575431671}}}}
