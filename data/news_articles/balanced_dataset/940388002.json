Still, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t successfully grow and leverage your network both by forming deeper connections with current contacts and by making valuable, new connections. Use these tips to network virtually with success.\n\nFirst, clean up your online brand. Ensure your social media accounts and, if applicable, website(s) are current and that they showcase the image you want to present to the world. Like it or not, you\u2019re a personal brand, and potential new contacts are going to check you out online. An audit and subsequent edit of your web identity will help you make the desired impression once you dig into virtual networking.\n\nMake the most of LinkedIn. \u201cIf you're serious about digital networking, you need a LinkedIn premium account,\u201d says Casey Halloran, CEO and co-founder of Costa Rican Vacations, a travel agency that sells high-end vacations to Costa Rica, Panama and Nicaragua. \u201cI block out time on my calendar each week to share content, make comments, solicit new connections and tune up my profile. This is an essential tool in the age of digital networking.\u201d\n\nScott Swedberg, CEO and founder of career services company The Job Sauce, says effective networking on LinkedIn includes focusing on so-called \u201csecond-degree\u201d connections. \u201cSearch through the connections of your top first-degree connections to see who they know,\u201d Swedberg advises. \u201cIt's as easy as asking the mutual connection to be introduced and providing a reason you want to speak with one of their connections.\u201d\n\nOther social media platforms, from Twitter to Facebook to Instagram, can, of course, be useful for expanding your network, too. Determine which platforms your ideal new connections/prospects are most active on and focus on building bridges there in a genuine way.\n\nParticipate in virtual \u201cmorning coffee\u201d and \u201chappy hour\u201d events: Identify such events that might have people with whom you\u2019d like to connect \u2013 and then participate. \u201cThese events typically allow users to participate for free and meet other professionals virtually via video conferencing software, such as Zoom and Join.me,\u201d says Amanda E. Moore, senior manager of integrated marketing and partnerships at Juno Beach, FL-based Loggerhead Marinelife Center, one of Florida's most visited nonprofit scientific destinations focused on ocean and sea turtle conservation.\n\nMoore notes that the face-to-face experience offers a more intimate networking opportunity and helps mimic similar in-person events. Participants can maximize the experience by connecting with other participants after the end of the event or by mentioning in the event that they are open to collaborations. \u201cWhen attending these events, it's helpful to read the event details beforehand and have a few topics or points of discussion in mind,\u201d Moore notes.\n\nAttend industry-specific virtual conferences and events: Moore says such events can provide a platform for professionals to share their thoughts, meet other professionals and learn from others in a truly meaningful way. Some such events provide virtual options to participate in breakout sessions, happy hours and online discussions. \u201cProfessionals can make the most out of these events by also participating in social media discussions, such as Twitter chats and Slack forums,\u201d Moore explains.\n\nGet active in relevant online forums and groups. Most industries have active forums, Facebook/LinkedIn groups, and other online communities that are full of people worth knowing, says Adam Sanders, founder and director of Successful Release, an organization dedicated to helping disadvantaged populations find financial and professional success. As such, join groups and forums where prospects, clients, colleagues and industry peers are interacting and become an active member.\n\n\u201cRemember you have to give value to get value,\u201d says Sanders. \u201cTaking some time to answer and ask questions and help other members of the group can be a great way to make a lot of new connections and drum up new business. It can take some time to build credibility, but the scale of many online groups is hard to beat.\u201d\n\nYou can also join online communities based around your personal interests. The common ground you\u2019ll have with others could help form relationships that bear fruit in the professional realm.\n\nShare expertise through new media. Identify podcasts, vlogs, blogs, niche news sites and other new media communication channels that have relevance to your industry and/or your clients/prospects. Then, offer to contribute your expertise. \u201cGetting your face or voice out there is easier than ever in this digital age, which adds to your authority, which makes it easier to network,\u201d says Halloran. \u201cMost times after I appear on a podcast, I get new LinkedIn requests out of nowhere, often from very interesting people.\u201d\n\nReignite your existing network. Block out time on your calendar to reach out to friends, colleagues, family, clients and others within your network. Don\u2019t make the reach \u201csalesy.\u201d\n\nBe human. \u201cWhen I do this, I ask how they\u2019re doing and share a bit of my own personal status,\u201d says Halloran, noting that you never know what opportunities that can lead to.\n\nEmail, of course, is a viable outreach vehicle. But, urges Sanders, don\u2019t overlook the phone and/or chats on Zoom or a similar platform. Given all the social distancing and working from home, people are more apt these days to jump on a call for a chat than they were just a few months ago.\n\n\u201cCall them up and check in with them about their business and see if there are any opportunities for you to help them out,\u201d advises Sanders. \u201cThis can be a great way to strengthen your existing relationships and find new business opportunities. Don't forget to also mention a few of the challenges that you're having and solicit their advice. Everyone is helpful when business is booming, but great partners are around when things are bad. This can lead to a lot of new referrals.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "ASI Central", "description": "Use these strategies from networking experts to gain valuable connections in the age of COVI...", "keywords": "Promotional Products, Promo Products, Supplier, Distributor, ESP, ESP Online, ESP Web, ESP Websites, Credit Connect, Connect, Counselor, Wearables, Supplier Global Resource, ASI, Advertising Specialty Institute, Norman Cohn, Tim Andrews, Product Research, Market research, ASI Show, Websites, Advertising, Decorator, Screen Printing, Embroidery, Logo Products, Branded products, Logo sportswear, Wholesale, Importer, Email Express, Pay For Placement, Chris Lovell, Rob Spike, Homebased Business, work from home", "twitter": {"domain": "ASICentral", "site": "@asicentral", "title": "7 Tips for Networking Virtually", "description": "Use these strategies from networking experts to gain valuable connections in the age of COVI...", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.asicentral.com/media/32761/virtual-meeting-zoom-479.jpg"}, "og": {"title": "7 Tips for Networking Virtually", "type": "Article", "url": "/news/newsletters/promogram/august-2020/7-tips-for-networking-virtually/", "image": "/media/32761/virtual-meeting-zoom-479.jpg", "description": "Use these strategies from networking experts to gain valuable connections in the age of COVI..."}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-12T00:00:00+00:00"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": true, "NOTES": []}}
