The figure was fastened to the fence with bungee cords when stolen. Pro-Trump flags and yard signs on the lawn were left behind.\n\nHeaney said she saw the figure from the front window around 2 p.m., but it was gone about two hours later when she looked again.\n\nHeaney wants the figure back.\n\n\u201cI want my Trumpy back,\u201d Heaney said. \u201cNo questions asked. Just drop it off in the driveway and leave it there.\u201d\n\nKELLY:Why won't America safeguard the upcoming presidential election?\n\nMORE:Pro-Trump ralliers call on 'silent majority' to support police, military, president\n\nHeaney said the thinks a Trump supporter stole the figure she bought last month for $60 to show it off. She said, the presidential items in her yard often cause motorists along the busy road to honk their horns or wave in approval.\n\nHeaney reasoned that anyone who is against the president would have found other ways to express their opinion of the display.\n\n\u201cIf somebody wanted to do something malicious, they would have thrown something at it,\u201d she said, before adding with a laugh, \u201cMaybe they would have shot it.\u201d\n\nHeaney said she filed a report with the State Police, which could not immediately be reached for an update.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anybody to get in trouble. I just want my Trump back,\u201d Heaney said.\n\nKyle Morel can also be contacted on Twitter: @KMorelNJH, on Facebook: Facebook.com/KMorelNJH, or by phone: 973-383-1292.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "I want my 'Trumpy back' says woman of stolen life-size plastic Trump in Lafayette", "description": "A Lafayette resident asked the community for help to track down her Donald Trump \u2014a life-size image of the president stolen from her front yard.", "url": "https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2020/08/12/trump-want-trumpy-back-nj-woman-stolen-life-size-image/3356047001/", "site_name": "North Jersey Media Group", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/08/12/PNJM/7d01168b-0685-42b6-94c1-f313b4374831-vv347-GVaNeW94C_jEDICd8UNlY.jpg?crop=2676,1506,x0,y0&width=2676&height=1506&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 2676, "height": 1506}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Kyle Morel", "content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "A Lafayette resident asked the community for help to track down her Donald Trump \u2014a life-size image of the president stolen from her front yard.", "fb": {"pages": 117907407522, "app_id": 130358300392751}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/08/12/PNJM/7d01168b-0685-42b6-94c1-f313b4374831-vv347-GVaNeW94C_jEDICd8UNlY.jpg?crop=2676,1506,x0,y0&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@northjersey", "creator": "@northjersey", "title": "I want my 'Trumpy back' says woman of stolen life-size plastic Trump in Lafayette", "description": "A Lafayette resident asked the community for help to track down her Donald Trump \u2014a life-size image of the president stolen from her front yard."}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
