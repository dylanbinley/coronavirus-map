So we were absolutely clear.\"\n\nThe Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) said while they were initially sympathetic to government's concerns about overburdening the healthcare system, the alcohol ban was devastating for jobs.\n\nCosatu's Matthew Parks said in the interest of saving jobs, Cosatu had been engaging with the alcohol industry and the entire value chain, and endorsed the call for an end to the ban.\n\n\"You cannot have the ban forever. We have to save the 750 000 jobs at risk,\" he said.\n\nSocial compact\n\nA social compact was being drafted. The draft was presented to government on how to mitigate the issue of alcohol abuse \u2013 a key issue that drove government to impose the ban.\n\nThe draft proposals included restrictions on the amount of alcohol sold, the times alcohol was sold and who can purchase it.\n\nIn mitigating the effects on the restaurant industry, the draft proposal also considered regulating how much a person could consume at a sit-down venue, like a restaurant or tavern.\n\nOther suggestions included banning alcohol ads by alcohol companies, instead focusing on consumer education.\n\nThe compact that government was considering also disallowed any drinking and driving.\n\nCoovadia said the social compact was yet to be signed, but that did not stop Ramaphosa from lifting the ban.\n\n\"It is to show government that we are all in agreement,\" he said.\n\nPay up\n\nOfficials from the Department of Labour and Treasury were warned that if government did not find money for worker relief, it could not impose any further restrictions.\n\n\"There is no way you can say restaurants have to operate at 50% or there is an alcohol ban without government providing financial relief,\" Parks said.\n\nHe added: \"If you extend lockdown, extend relief.\"\n\nThe government's reassessment of the booze ban was in line with claims they made in court that the government would balance health measures with the impact on the economy.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "W0_7yq_PWtgJ8hNc082TW_yxTNwyOrRpPkMLFxO6FlM", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@polityZA", "creator": "@polityZA", "title": "Lift the ban and we will help with overburdened healthcare system - alcohol industry to govt", "description": "The alcohol industry and business representatives met with Health Minister Zweli Mkhize on Wednesday, as government prepares to lift the alcohol ban.
