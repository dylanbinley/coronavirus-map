It wasn\u2019t the first time the two tribes clashed in Port Sudan or elsewhere in the county.\n\nThe clashes prompted local authorities on Tuesday to impose a round-the-clock curfew across the city. Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok said Wednesday that troops have been deployed to Port Sudan to help contain the fighting.\n\nHe urged political parties in eastern Sudan to cooperate with local authorities to \u201cprotect security and social peace.\u201d\n\nThe Sudan Doctors\u2019 Committee said the clashes continued until late Tuesday. The death toll climbed to 25, after 13 people were initially reported killed on Tuesday, it said. At least 87 others were wounded.\n\nThe committee is part of the Sudanese Professionals\u2019 Association that spearheaded nationwide protests against longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir. The military ousted al-Bashir amid the protests in April last year.\n\nLocal media reported that several houses and shops were set on fire amid the violence in Port Sudan.\n\nThe tensions between the two tribes date back to May 2019 in the eastern city of Qadarif, mainly over water and other resources. The clashes flared up in August last year in Port Sudan, when at least three dozen people from both sides were killed. They also clashed in January in the port city, when nine people were killed.\n\nThe tribal violence poses a significant challenge to efforts of Sudan\u2019s transitional authorities to stabilize the country amid a fragile transition to democracy.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.
