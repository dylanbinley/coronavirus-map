He should know that the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) report published last week states: \"Children are more likely to have a mild or asymptomatic infection, meaning that the infection may go undetected or undiagnosed.\" It also states: \"When symptomatic, children shed virus in similar quantities to adults and can infect others in a similar way to adults.\"\n\nIn fact, there are numerous documented studies outlining the scale of risk associated with reopening schools.\n\nIn Israel, where class sizes are big (like Ireland), the virus spread to students' homes, other schools and neighbourhoods, ultimately infecting hundreds of students, teachers and relatives. Across the country, thousands of students and teachers were quarantined.\n\nIsrael's deputy director of public health services, Dr Udi Kliner, said that \"schools, not restaurants or gyms, turned out to be the country's worst mega-infectors\".\n\nA large new study from South Korea shows that children between the ages of 10 and 19 can spread the virus at least as well as adults do.\n\nCases among children in Germany have increased by 50pc since they reopened schools, and researchers in Berlin tested more than 3,700 coronavirus patients and found that children carried the same viral load as adults.\n\nOur Government seems unaware of these facts given the 'roadmap' for school reopening does little to mitigate them.\n\nAerosol transmission, for example, is not acknowledged, despite emerging evidence that the virus can travel up to four metres (16 feet) across an indoor space. This raises questions about proper ventilation, face masks, and the efficacy of the roadmap's 'pods' - none of which are \u00adadequately addressed.\n\nAnother gaping omission from the roadmap is how to accommodate the many children who have underlying health conditions or whose family members are high risk. What virtual/remote alternatives will be provided for those children who cannot attend school but remain entitled to an education?\n\nWhat about the risks associated with multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) which is a Covid-related disease affecting children? Although the numbers are small, if contracted, it affects the heart and other major organs in the body and in a few cases it has proved fatal. Have teachers been made aware of the prevalence of this disease in children and how to spot it?\n\nCommunity transmission is another key risk factor. The safe opening of schools was always contingent on levels being low.\n\nThe National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) warned Miche\u00e1l Martin: \"We have to prevent the reimportation of the virus and unless we do that, we are not going to be in a position to reopen our schools and get the economy up and running again.\"\n\nIgnoring public health advisers, the Government allowed, and continues to allow, tourists from the US, the most infected country in the world, unfettered access to our communities, thus reimporting the virus. Banned by other EU countries and Canada because the infection rate was out of control, Ireland said \"f\u00e1ilte\".\n\nEven when New York banned flights from Texas, where in one day 10,000 new cases were recorded, flights from Dallas landed here with no mandatory requirement to quarantine, and no testing.\n\nWith an R-rate now of almost 2, how can it possibly be deemed safe to reopen schools? The Government's claim that \"only 2pc\" of cases are related to foreign travel is disingenuous. As Dr Gabriel Scally warns, if we're not quarantining and testing at source, the evidence trail is lost until it's seeded in the community.\n\nInstead of changing strategy, Mr Martin wants us to learn to live with the virus.\n\nHowever much money we throw at adapting our environments, as long as coronavirus is in our communities it will infiltrate our schools, nursing homes and workplaces.\n\nThe only sustainable option is to adopt a zero-Covid approach, which is to eradicate the virus from our shores, as New Zealand has attempted.\n\nThat requires mandatory quarantine so that all imported cases are detected on entry, thus preventing community transmission and allowing schools, pubs, theatres and businesses to open at full capacity, safe in the knowledge that the silent assassin is not lurking in the shadows.\n\nIt's crucial that schools reopen but it has to be done safely. After three months of being homeschooled by me, my child wrote a poem entitled The Witch which he insisted I send to his teacher. It was probably about me but I can't be sure.\n\nIn the words of the WHO's director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, \"Treat the decisions about where you go, what you do, and who you meet as life-and-death decisions - because they are.\"\n\nUntil the Government can guarantee that reopening schools is safe, my child's not getting back in the water.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover", "description": "Listening to Leo Varadkar on RT\u00c9, \"guaranteeing\" outbreaks of coronavirus in schools when they open, reminded me of the mayor in Jaws.", "fb": {"pages": 96796398469, "app_id": 714861305308164}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=335158729, app-argument=https://www.independent.ie/opinion/comment/government-is-making-life-and-death-call-on-schools-reopening-it-has-to-get-it-right-39451430.html", "og": {"title": "Tess Finch-Lees: Government is making life-and-death call on schools reopening - it has to get it right", "site_name": "independent", "description": "Listening to Leo Varadkar on RT\u00c9, \"guaranteeing\" outbreaks of coronavirus in schools when they open, reminded me of the mayor in Jaws.", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/opinion/comment/government-is-making-life-and-death-call-on-schools-reopening-it-has-to-get-it-right-39451430.html", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/9c2e2/39451178.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/page32_schools.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/9c2e2/39451178.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/page32_schools.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1240, "height": 700}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Independent_ie", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/opinion/comment/government-is-making-life-and-death-call-on-schools-reopening-it-has-to-get-it-right-39451430.html", "title": "Tess Finch-Lees: Government is making life-and-death call on schools reopening - it has to get it right", "description": "Listening to Leo Varadkar on RT\u00c9, \"guaranteeing\" outbreaks of coronavirus in schools when they open, reminded me of the mayor in Jaws.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/9c2e2/39451178.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/page32_schools.jpg", "alt": "Helping hand: As children return to school, the stakes are high.
