But, the court had held, it is \u201cintended to be a protection to the public, whose interests would be very much affected if by the act or conduct of any party, the authority of the court is lowered and the sense of confidence which people have in the administration of justice by it is weakened\u201d.\n\nIt was held in the case that \u201ca publication which attacks on individual judges or the court as a whole, with or without reference to particular case, casting unwarranted and defamatory aspersions upon the character or ability of the judges, would come within the term of scandalizing the Court\u201d. The three-judge bench also said that the Constitution Bench had ruled that it is \u201cnot necessary to prove affirmatively that there has been an actual interference with the administration of justice by reason of such defamatory statement; it is enough if it is likely, or tends in any way, to interfere with the proper administration of justice\u201d.\n\nFriday\u2019s judgment also referred to the 1970 decision in E M Sankaran Namboodripad vs. T Narayanan Nambiar case, wherein the court had upheld conviction of former Kerala chief minister Namboodripad for contempt by the state High Court for remarks made at a press conference.\n\nChief Justice M Hidayatullah had observed in the case that \u201cwhen the conduct of a person tends to bring the authority and administration of the law into disrespect or disregard, the same would amount to scandalising the Court. This conduct includes all acts which bring the court into disrepute or disrespect or which offend its dignity, affront its majesty or challenge its authority.\u201d\n\nIn C K Daphtary & Ors. vs. O P Gupta & Ors, a Constitution Bench of SC held in 1971 that a \u201cscurrilous attack\u201d on a judge, even in respect of \u201cpast conduct\u201d, has an adverse effect on the due administration of justice, Friday\u2019s ruling pointed out.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution Bench has unambiguously held that this sort of attack in a country like ours has the inevitable effect of undermining the confidence of the public in judiciary, and if the confidence in judiciary goes, due administration of justice definitely suffers,\u201d the three-judge bench held.\n\nThe bench pointed out that in Baradakanta Mishra vs. State of Orissa, the SC had said in 1974 that \u201cscandalisation of the Court is a species of contempt and may take several forms\u201d.\n\nThe three-judge bench concluded that while the first part of a tweet by Bhushan regarding Chief Justice of India S A Bobde can be said to be \u201ca criticism made against the CJI as an individual and not against the CJI as CJI,\u201d the \u201csecond part of the tweet\u2026undisputedly\u2026criticises the CJI in his capacity as the Chief Justice of India\u2026\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udce3 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
