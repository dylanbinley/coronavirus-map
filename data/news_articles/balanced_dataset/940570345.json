(Vivek Prakash/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHong Kong to Allow Transit Passengers from Mainland China\n\nPassengers from mainland China will be allowed to travel through Hong Kong International Airport from Saturday, according to new rules.\n\nHong Kong airport announced on Thursday that passengers from mainland China will soon be able to transfer or transit through Hong Kong to other destinations from Aug. 15 until Oct. 15.\n\nHowever, transit in the other direction, inbound to mainland China, will remain banned as China\u2019s aviation regulator continues to severely limit the number of international flights citing concerns over the spread of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) virus.\n\nDr. Ho Pak-leung of the University of Hong Kong told local broadcaster RTHK that he was concerned by the government\u2019s decision to allow transit or transfer passengers from China given that places like Xinjiang and Liaoning were still reporting clusters of infections. Many Hongkongers also do not trust the CCP\u2019s official infection and death data.\n\nStudents to Travel as EU Lifts Restrictions for China\n\nHong Kong airline Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. will be a beneficiary of the new policy, enabling Chinese students to resume studies at overseas universities, given rival Hong Kong Airlines fly only regionally in Asia, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nStudents from China are expected to be able to fly to countries in the European Union after China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian indicated on Aug. 10 that Beijing would reciprocate the European Council\u2019s June 30 proposal to lift travel restrictions. The EU said it would open up travel to China if Beijing reciprocated the gesture.\n\n\u201cChina is relaxing in an orderly and gradual manner visa restrictions for foreigners entering China to resume economic activities and for other essential purposes,\u201d Zhao said. Over the following two days, Chinese embassies across Europe all posted that eligible foreign nationals with residence permits could now apply for new Chinese visas in 36 European countries.\n\nThis is the first significant action taken by China to reverse its late March travel ban, except for its agreement with the United States mid-June to allow four flights a week between the two countries.\n\nRead More China, US to Each Allow 4 Weekly Flights for Airlines\n\nHong Kong airport had started allowing transit passengers not from mainland China through the airport on June 1 for a maximum of eight hours.\n\nThe Thursday announcement has extended the layover time to within 24 hours. \u201cPassengers should also confirm in advance that they are able to enter the final destination,\u201d the airport said in a press release.\n\nThe airport authority told The Epoch Times in an email that it \u201chas implemented a host of enhanced health measures at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) to prepare for the gradual resumption of transfer/transit services.\u201d\n\nTicket prices for flights into China continue to be extremely expensive \u201cbecause of the CAAC\u2019s [Civil Aviation Administration of China] policy\u201d of limiting international flights, Wang Guanran, who organizes charter flights for Chinese wanting to return home, told The South China Morning Post.\n\n\u201cThis issue is exacerbated by brokers and airline insiders selling tickets at a mark-up.\u201d\n\nHong Kong reported 69 new CCP virus cases on Thursday, of which 4 were from returning international travelers. This was slightly down from early-August when cases were closer to 100.\n\nAuthorities cautioned the global financial hub still faced a critical period to control the virus, which has seen a resurgence since early July.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nWatch Next:\n\nThe Coverup of the Century | ZOOMING IN SPECIAL", "METADATA": {"msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/assets/themes/eet/images/EET270.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": 1615635982023706, "admins": 10205921529470972, "app_id": 1316421701839253}, "date": "2020-08-13 9:57:27 AM", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "description": "Passengers from mainland China will be allowed to travel through Hong Kong International Airport from Saturday, according to ...", "keywords": "Hong Kong,hong kong airport,THE EPOCH TIMES", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Hong Kong to Allow Transit Passengers from Mainland China", "description": "Passengers from mainland China will be allowed to travel through Hong Kong International Airport from Saturday, according to ...", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/hong-kong-to-allow-transit-passengers-from-mainland-china_3459889.html", "site_name": "www.theepochtimes.com", "updated_time": "2020-08-13T19:29:17-04:00", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2020/01/26/hong-kong-airport-coronavirus-1200x800.jpg"}, "article": {"tag": "Hong Kong,hong kong airport", "section": "Asia & Pacific", "published_time": "2020-08-13T09:57:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T19:29:17-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Passengers from mainland China will be allowed to travel through Hong Kong International Airport from Saturday, according to ...", "title": "Hong Kong to Allow Transit Passengers from Mainland China", "site": "@EpochTimes", "domain": "www.theepochtimes.com", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2020/01/26/hong-kong-airport-coronavirus.jpg", "creator": "@EpochTimes"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"package": "com.theepochtimes.news", "url": "eetapp://applinks/hong-kong-to-allow-transit-passengers-from-mainland-china_3459889.html", "app_name": "The Epoch Times: Live & Breaking"}, "ios": {"app_store_id": 670443321, "app_name": "The Epoch Times: Live & Breakings", "url": "eetapp://applinks/hong-kong-to-allow-transit-passengers-from-mainland-china_3459889.html"}}}}}
