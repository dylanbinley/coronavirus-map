Our association with IHH is a significant alliance in the healthcare industry in India. We pride ourselves on a culture of serving our patients with care and compassion and the association with IHH would foster that goal. We will work with all relevant authorities to ensure a smooth transition of the brand,\u201dRavi Rajagopal, Chairman, Fortis Healthcare said in a statement.Dr Ashutosh Raghuvanshi, MD and CEO, Fortis Healthcare, shared that, \u201cWe have always seen potential synergies between our company and IHH and look to leverage IHH\u2019s global healthcare expertise to grow our organization further. Our association has come at a point in time when healthcare in India and globally is experiencing a substantial transformation. As a brand, our company has had several facets and we have always believed that we stand for much more.
