"TEXT": "Technology prices in South Africa have increased significantly in recent months, and the price of smartphones has also been affected.\n\nThese increases can be attributed to the falling value of the rand against the US dollar, as well as supplier shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSouth African mobile operators have also faced a shortage of Apple iPhones specifically, which is only now beginning to be alleviated.\n\nCell C previously told MyBroadband that this shortage could be attributed to three incidents \u2013 the Chinese New Year, COVID-19 related supply challenges in China, and the lockdown restrictions in South Africa.\n\nCertain products from Samsung, Huawei, and LG were also affected, but iPhones were the most heavily impacted.\n\nSome mobile networks said that despite production and supply interruptions, they were able to cover stock shortages thanks to well-managed inventory processes and timely delivery during level 5 lockdown.\n\nMany South Africans may feel that these increased prices mean they are paying inordinately high prices for smartphones and other tech products than other countries around the world.\n\niPhone 11 price comparison\n\nTo give an idea of how South African prices differ from those charged for these products overseas, we looked at the price of a new iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max in the following countries:\n\nSouth Africa\n\nUnited States\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nFinland\n\nAustralia\n\nBrazil\n\nAs sales tax is not included in the price of an iPhone in the United States, we added an average markup of 7.25% to make this price more comparable with that of other countries.\n\nIt is important to note that the real combined sales tax rate would depend on which individual state the iPhone was purchased in.\n\nThe price of these iPhones was converted to South African rand using the exchange rate at the time of writing, and this figure was used to rank the prices from most expensive to cheapest.\n\nWhile this provides a rough idea of how much more South Africans pay for iPhone 11 devices, it should be noted that this price difference may be influenced by a number of factors.\n\nThese include shipping costs, as South Africa is much farther away from Apple\u2019s global distribution centres than many other countries in this comparison.\n\nImport duties may differ compared with other countries as well, meaning that local distributors may be charged more for bringing iPhones into the country than distributors in Europe or Australia.\n\nSales volumes are also a consideration, as local distributors may not be able to import as many iPhones as international distributors, and therefore they will not benefit from bulk volume discounts to the same extent.\n\niPhone 11 \u2013 South Africa vs The World\n\nThe prices of iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max smartphones in South Africa and a number of other countries are listed below.\n\nPricing information was sourced from the Apple website in the international regions and iStore South Africa for South African pricing.\n\nCountry Price iPhone 11 64GB South Africa R18,499
