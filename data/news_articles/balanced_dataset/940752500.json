Guests who don't wish to venture onto the water can choose to watch the screenings from deckchairs in the square.\n\nFilms still to come in 2020, from Tenet to Top Gun: Maverick 18 show all Films still to come in 2020, from Tenet to Top Gun: Maverick 1/18 Tenet - August 26 Christopher Nolan\u2019s latest mind-bending blockbuster sees John David Washington\u2019s special agent attempt to prevent a conflict \"worse than World War III\" through the manipulation of time. It's expected to be the first big release UK film fans get to enjoy in reopened cinemas \u2013 in America, that honour belongs to Selena Gomez vehicle The Broken Hearts Gallery. 2/18 Bill and Ted Face the Music - August 21 Party on, dudes! Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter return to their classic roles for the first time in 29 years. The pair head off on another journey through time, searching for inspiration after being tasked with writing a song that will reunite the world and \"save reality as we know it\". The film will follow them as they attempt to steal the song from their future selves, encountering very different, muscle-bound versions of themselves in prison. Most excellent? We'll see. Patti Perret/Most Excellent Productions, LLC 3/18 Mulan - delayed indefinitely Disney's much-anticipated live-action reboot has been delayed until late August. The update on the 1998 animation stars the likes of Yifei Liu, Donnie Yen, Li Gong and Jet Li, with the official synopsis reading: \"To save her ailing father from serving in the Imperial Army, a fearless young woman disguises herself as a man to battle northern invaders in China.\" 4/18 A Quiet Place Part II - September 4 Make a sound and you die \u2013 it\u2019s the wonderfully simple premise that made the first film the horror hit of 2018, and now Emily Blunt is back for more. The John Krasinski-directed film picks up shortly after the events of the original, with Blunt\u2019s matriarch leading her family in the wake of an alien apocalypse. Will we finally get some answers to the film's infamous plot holes? 5/18 The King's Man - September 18 New spy prequel The King's Man explores the origins of the espionage agency at the heart of the recent Kingsman films. The movie appears to be set around the outbreak of World War One and will feature some of the 20th century\u2019s most notorious figures, including Rasputin and Kaiser Wilhelm II. Being a prequel, there's no sign of Colin Firth or Taron Egerton, but the cast still has its fair share of heavy hitters, with Charles Dance, Gemma Arterton and Ralph Fiennes all putting in a turn. 6/18 Candyman - September 25 The excellent Jordan Peele produces this fresh take on the cult 1992 horror, which revisits the infamous urban legend that states that the demonic figure with a hook for a hand will appear in the mirror if you say his name five times. The first trailer is especially eerie, and offers a first listen for the the film\u2019s soundtrack, which puts a dark twist on the Destiny\u2019s Child song Say My Name \u2013 not dissimilar to the way Peele twisted the Luniz track I Got 5 On It so effectively in previous film Us. 7/18 The Many Saints of Newark \u2013 September 25 James Gandolfini\u2019s son Michael plays a young Tony Soprano in the upcoming Sopranos prequel, telling the story of the mob boss\u2019s rise to prominence in New Jersey\u2019s criminal underbelly. The film, which plays out against the backdrop of the Newark race riots of the Sixties, is helmed by Sopranos creator David Chase, which should be a relief to the show's legions of fans worried that its legacy will be tarnished. Getty Images 8/18 Wonder Woman 1984 - October 2 The film that put the DC universe back on track, Wonder Woman, is back for a sequel. Gal Gadot will step into the role once again, taking on archenemy Cheetah (Kristen Wiig) against the backdrop of the Cold War. Good news for fans of Chris Pine, too; filmmakers have found a way to bring back Steve Trevor, despite his apparent death in the first film. 9/18 Death on the Nile - October 9 Kenneth Branagh is donning his moustache and preposterous French accent for a second time, returning to the role of Agatha Christie's detective Poirot. The follow-up to 2017's middling Murder on the Orient Express is another classic Christie tale, with Gal Gadot, Letitia Wright, Armie Hammer, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders and Russel Brand among the cast. 10/18 The French Dispatch - October 16 Wes Anderson\u2019s love letter to journalism is one of the movies that would have been recognised at the postponed Cannes Film Festival, and it looks to be one of the most visually arresting Anderson features to date. It\u2019s possible the strongest cast the director has had to play with, too, with the likes of Benicio del Toro, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, L\u00e9a Seydoux, Frances McDormand, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Bill Murray playing the staff of a European publication. 11/18 Black Widow - November 6 Scarlett Johansson has had to wait a little longer to star in her first standalone Marvel film, which takes place following the events of 2016 film Captain America: Civil War and sees her unite with her estranged superhero family and face a formidable villain in the seemingly unstoppable Taskmaster. Johansson stars alongside the likes of Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz and David Harbour. 12/18 Godzilla v Kong - November 20 We can\u2019t be the only ones looking forward to seeing two 100-foot monsters knock 10 bells out of each other later this year. Sure, 2019\u2019s Godzilla: King of the Monsters was as silly as they come, but this follow-up is going to be bigger, badder and all the better for it. 13/18 Soul - November 20 This inventive new Pixar animation film follows jaded teacher, musician and New Yorker Joe Gardner, who dreams of playing at the Blue Note jazz club. After falling down a manhole, he becomes a spirit and enters a surreal new world. There, he connects with another lost soul and reevaluates the things important to him in life. 14/18 No Time To Die - November 25 One of the first movies to be postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak, the 25th Bond movie is the end of an era. The movie, co-written by Fleabag\u2019s Phoebe Waller-Bridge, marks Daniel Craig\u2019s final outing as James Bond after 14 years and five movies in the role. There are rumours that Bond has a daughter in this one, too, so we may well see a different side of the man. 15/18 Dune - December 18 David Lynch\u2019s take on Frank Herbert\u2019s epic sci-fi novel Dune proved a notorious mess in 1984, and now visionary filmmaker Denis Villeneuve is attempting to put the record straight. The Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 director will tell the story of a planet containing the most valuable material in the universe, called \u2018the spice\u2019, with performances from Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin and more. 16/18 Coming 2 America - December 18 Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall and Wesley Snipes are all on board for this blockbuster comedy sequel. The original tells the story of Prince Akeem (Murphy), who arrives in New York from a fictional African nation in an effort to find a woman interested in more than his wealth and status. The follow-up picks up 30 years later, as Akeem hopes to reunite with his long-lost son. 17/18 West Side Story - December 18 Master filmmaker Steven Spielberg is rebooting the classic musical, with Baby Driver\u2019s Ansel Elgort in the lead role. The remake of the classic tale, itself based on Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet, tells the story of a couple from warring street gangs, with stunning music from Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim. 18/18 Top Gun: Maverick - December 23 Tom Cruise is back in the pilot\u2019s seat as the legendary Pete \u2018Maverick\u2019 Mitchell, more than three decades after starring in the 1986 original. Fans can expect all the adrenalin and aerial acrobatics of the original, with Val Kilmer, Miles Teller, John Hamm, Glenn Powell, Jennifer Connelly and Jay Ellis all joining Cruise in the case. The first two trailers promise breathtaking aerial aerobatics. 1/18 Tenet - August 26 Christopher Nolan\u2019s latest mind-bending blockbuster sees John David Washington\u2019s special agent attempt to prevent a conflict \"worse than World War III\" through the manipulation of time.
