The process could take as short as a matter of days.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.

That could come at a scheduled meeting of foreign ministers in Berlin at the end of this month, or possibly later, according to two officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. Any decision has to be taken unanimously.\n\nViolent Crackdown\n\n\u201cMost ministers were inclined to introduce targeted, individual sanctions for those that stood behind falsifying of the election or unjustified use of force,\u201d Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz told reporters while the meeting was ongoing. \u201cThe EU will work out the list.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "HFx4AmVFgqeujai2emtdvHkNm_b9CI26iHIwS5ve8Jc", "vf": {"container_id": "ac04d59d-1b5a-46d2-9fd9-ac40f30dedb2"}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Regina Leader Post", "title": "EU Takes Step Toward Imposing Fresh Sanctions on Belarus"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/reginaleaderpost/"}, "twitter": {"site": "@leaderpost", "title": "EU Takes Step Toward Imposing Fresh Sanctions on Belarus", "card": "summary"}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/eu-takes-step-toward-imposing-fresh-sanctions-on-belarus?ia_markup=1"}, "fb": {"pages": 141888329160971}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
