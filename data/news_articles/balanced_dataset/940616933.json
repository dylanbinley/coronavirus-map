The company plans to exit Hudson County in October.\n\nJerseyBike\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of news that Citi Bike is coming to Hoboken, creating transportation continuity with Jersey City and New York City. JerseyBike only operates in Hudson County, and its exit signals its disbandment, said Lourdes Martinez, lead sponsorship and marketing coordinator at P3 Global Management, which manages the system.\n\n\u201cWe have had to examine and accept the fact that the resources that are required to own and operate a successful shared micromobility system make it impossible to continue the program at this time,\u201d said P3 Global Management director of operations Matt Finelli.\n\nThere have been more than 74,000 registered JerseyBike riders in Hudson County throughout its tenure here, according to the company, which says existing bike passes can be used until Oct. 9.\n\nHoboken and Jersey City will soon both have Citi Bike after deciding to jointly pursue a new contract with the system earlier this summer. Previously, riders couldn\u2019t conveniently travel between the two cities. JerseyBike users had nowhere to dock their bikes in Jersey City, while Citi Bike riders from Jersey City had nowhere to dock in Hoboken.\n\nJerseyBike, however, was contiguous from Hoboken up through the northern part of the county.\n\nThe end of JerseyBike in Hudson County means the five other municipalities will have to decide whether to find a new company to operate bike-shares on their streets.\n\nBayonne spokesman Joe Ryan said the city would look into finding a new provider.\n\nNorth Bergen, meanwhile, is also looking into a replacement program and hopes to have one that residents can use in neighboring municipalities, said township public information officer Art Schwartz.\n\n\u201cWe have not yet had any discussions with neighboring municipalities about future plans,\u201d he said. \u201cCiti Bike is certainly an option that we would be interested in exploring.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435, "app_id": 127523153942902}, "title": "JerseyBike to exit Hudson County in October", "og": {"title": "JerseyBike to exit Hudson County in October", "url": "https://www.nj.com/hudson/2020/08/jerseybike-to-exit-hudson-county-in-october.html", "site_name": "nj", "type": "article", "description": "JerseyBike\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of news that Citi Bike is coming to Hoboken, which will create transportation continuity with Jersey City and New York City.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nj.com/resizer/UImony40s3EVFYMYidHyhwkTKDk=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/DXFVK3QBOBDABFEHKO5B3FF6FI.JPG", "width": 1280}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T19:49:33.563Z", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T19:49:33.563Z", "section": "Hudson"}, "twitter": {"title": "JerseyBike to exit Hudson County in October", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "JerseyBike\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of news that Citi Bike is coming to Hoboken, which will create transportation continuity with Jersey City and New York City.", "image": "https://www.nj.com/resizer/UImony40s3EVFYMYidHyhwkTKDk=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/DXFVK3QBOBDABFEHKO5B3FF6FI.JPG"}, "article_publication_name": "https://www.nj.com/hudson/2020/08/jerseybike-to-exit-hudson-county-in-october.html", "article_date_original": "Thursday, August 13, 2020, 03:49 PM", "article_date_updated": "Thursday, August 13, 2020, 03:49 PM", "sailthru.tags": "hudson,north bergen,weehawken,bayonne,hudson county,hoboken,citi,jerseybike", "sailthru.date": "Thursday, August 13, 2020, 03:49 PM", "sailthru.title": "JerseyBike to exit Hudson County in October", "sailthru.author": "twestjj", "sailthru.description": "JerseyBike\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of news that Citi Bike is coming to Hoboken, which will create transportation continuity with Jersey City and New York City.", "sections": "hudson,jjournal,news,business", "byline": "Teri West | The Jersey Journal", "subscriber_only": "false", "Description": "JerseyBike\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of news that Citi Bike is coming to Hoboken, which will create transportation continuity with Jersey City and New York City.", "article_author": "Teri West |  twest@jjournal.com"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
