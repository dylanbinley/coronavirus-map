We just have different experiences,\u201d said McDougall.\n\nClarke is expected to announce next week his intention to seek a third term as regional mayor.\n\nWhile declining to release specifics of her campaign until a later date, McDougall said she won\u2019t be using any plastic signs or door-to-door campaigning.\n\nInstead, the campaign will focus on social media, telephone calls and mail outs.\n\nAs to why she decided to seek the mayor\u2019s office, McDougall said she has been encouraged by a number of people to take the bold step and seek the top elected job in the province\u2019s second largest municipality.\n\nMcDougall is currently the executive director of the environmental action group ACAP Cape Breton, a position she said she was will relinquish if elected as mayor.\n\n\u201cThe decision to run as your next mayor of the CBRM has been a monumental decision for not only me but my entire family,\u201d said McDougall, in giving her stomach a gentle rub and suggesting she may be the only mayoral candidate who is pregnant.\n\nMcDougall is already a mom to her partner, Kevin\u2019s, six-year-old son Ronan. She is scheduled to give birth around the middle of December.\n\n\u201cI would not have undertaken this bid without supports in place,\u201d said McDougall, adding that growing a family will be a constant reminder that decisions made at council will impact on generations to come.\n\nAs to who may replace her in District 8, McDougall said she won\u2019t be endorsing any candidates but has already met with several individuals interested in the job to explain the expectations and demands of the position.\n\nMunicipal voters across the province head to the polls Oct. 17. Voters in the CBRM will elect 12 councillors and a mayor.\n\nRELATED:", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The thorny issues of equalization payments and taxation will be front and centre for mayoral candidate Amanda McDougall who formally announced her candidacy Friday in Sydney.\r\n\r\nThe 37-year-old Main-a-Dieu resident is nearing the end of her first", "author": "The Telegram", "og": {"title": "UPDATED: McDougall announces CBRM mayoral bid | The Telegram", "description": "The thorny issues of equalization payments and taxation will be front and centre for mayoral candidate Amanda McDougall who formally announced her candidacy Friday in Sydney.\r\n\r\nThe 37-year-old Main-a-Dieu resident is nearing the end of her first", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thetelegram.com/media/photologue/photos/cache/race-is-on-for-mayors-job-1_medium.jpg", "width": 458, "height": 305}, "url": "http://www.thetelegram.com/news/canada/updated-mcdougall-announces-cbrm-mayoral-bid-485384/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "UPDATED: McDougall announces CBRM mayoral bid | The Telegram", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thetelegram.com/media/photologue/photos/cache/race-is-on-for-mayors-job-1_medium.jpg", "alt": "Cape Breton Regional Municipality councillor Amanda McDougall used the Ballie Ard trail system in Sydney as the backdrop for her announcement Friday that she is seeking election as CBRM mayor.
