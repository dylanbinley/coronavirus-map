Picture: Graeme Parkes\n\nAfter spending close to 20 years behind bars, Noosa\u2019s Christmas Day rapist walked away from prison on Thursday a free man.\n\nAt 49, Kym Spoehr kidnapped, tied up and repeatedly violated a Japanese tourist in Noosa National Park on Christmas Day in 2001.\n\nHe served 14 years in jail for the rape, but returned to jail after he hit another prisoner in a housing precinct with a piece of wood.\n\nNoosa Christmas Day rapist released from jail\n\nNow 68, Spoehr, was released back into society on Thursday, August 12, free to roam about the community.\n\nCurrently, Queensland does not have a public sex offenders register, and therefore the public has no knowledge if a sex offender, such as Spoehr, is living in their town.\n\nLNP Shadow Attorney-General David Janetzki said this was not acceptable, claiming the Labor Government is \u201csoft on sex offenders, putting their rights ahead of the community safety\u201d.\n\n\u201cLabor has watered down the supervision of offenders and is allowing predators to be monitored \u2018remotely\u2019 during the coronavirus crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Spoehr\u2019s new residence may be unknown, he will be supervised until August 12, 2025, joining about 21,000 Queenslanders on community-based orders.\n\nAccording to the Queensland Corrective Services website, community-based orders are set either by the courts or by Parole Board Queensland.\n\nQueensland Corrective Services\u2019 role is to ensure the orders are followed.\n\n\u201cWe have no legal authority to restrict the movement of offenders unless there are court or parole conditions that allow it,\u201d the website states.\n\nAccording to the site, unless the sex offender\u2019s order prevents them from frequenting particular areas, offenders on supervision orders have every right to move about in the community.\n\n\u201cIn fact, it is an important part of their re-entry as a productive member of society,\u201d the site states.\n\n\u201cOffenders need to be able to access accommodation, employment, health services and community support services to minimise their risk of reoffending.\u201d\n\nMr Janetzki claimed Queenslanders \u201cmust be better protected from sexual offenders when they are released back into the community\u201d.\n\n\u201cAn LNP Government will introduce a public sex offenders\u2019 register which will allow Queenslanders to check if a sexual offender is living in their neighbourhood,\u201d he said.", "METADATA": {"description": "After spending close to 20 years behind bars, Noosa\u2019s Christmas Day rapist walked away from prison on Thursday a free man.", "author": "Matt Collins", "keywords": "noosa-rapist, sex-offenders-register", "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"app_id": 143329145682245, "pages": 24945426253}, "og": {"site_name": "Sunshine Coast Daily", "title": "Rapist walking free sparks calls for sex offender register", "description": "After spending close to 20 years behind bars, Noosa\u2019s Christmas Day rapist walked away from prison on Thursday a free man.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2020/08/13/v3imagesbin99203ee393a1dfb8fc98ac90e4dd1c1c-vebs2ye5ypfj6td9uu2_ct1880x930.jpg", "width": 1880, "height": 930}, "url": "https://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/rapist-walking-free-sparks-calls-for-sex-offender-/4078014/"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047077737, app-argument=sunshinecoastdaily://article?aid=4078014&type=article", "al": {"ios": {"url": "sunshinecoastdaily://article?aid=4078014&type=article", "app_store_id": 1047077737, "app_name": "Sunshine Coast Daily"}, "android": {"url": "sunshinecoastdaily://article?aid=4078014&type=article", "app_name": "Sunshine Coast Daily", "package": "com.apnarm.sunshinecoastdaily"}, "web": {"url": "https://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/rapist-walking-free-sparks-calls-for-sex-offender-/4078014/"}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@the_daily", "title": "Rapist walking free sparks calls for sex offender register", "description": "After spending close to 20 years behind bars, Noosa\u2019s Christmas Day rapist walked away from prison on Thursday a free man.", "image": "https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2020/08/13/v3imagesbin99203ee393a1dfb8fc98ac90e4dd1c1c-vebs2ye5ypfj6td9uu2_ct300x300.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=1020", "capi-id": "932acb4209e21b4fe4e9b148f9286b5c", "article": {"content_tier": "locked"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
