Two French Rafale fighter jets made a stop on the Greek island of Crete after an exercise in Cyprus.\n\nThe mounting tension follows Turkey\u2019s deployment of a seismic research vessel, escorted by warships, into waters between Crete and Cyprus to prospect for potential offshore gas and oil, following similar discoveries elsewhere in the region.\n\nGreece claims part of the area covers its own continental shelf and has demanded that the Turkish ships withdraw. Turkey counters that it\u2019s entitled to conduct research there. Greece placed its military on alert, and sent warships to the area off Turkey\u2019s southern coast.\n\nThe French Defense Ministry said France\u2019s military presence \u201caffirms the country\u2019s attachment to free movement, maritime safety and respect for international law in the Mediterranean Sea.\u201d\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted that French President Emmanuel Macron was \u201ca true friend of Greece and also a fervent protector of European values and international law.\u201d\n\nIn Ankara, and later in talks with European officials, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated a call for dialogue.\n\n\u201cThe path for a solution in the eastern Mediterranean is dialogue and negotiation,\u201d Erdogan said during an address to his ruling party's officials. \u201cA formula based on a win-win solution that protects the rights of all can be found if we act with common sense and reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreece's attitude in the Aegean and the Mediterranean is malicious,\u201d Erdogan said, adding that the Greek island on which Athens bases its continental shelf claim is located just 2 kilometers (1.25 miles) from the Turkish coast and 580 kilometers (360 miles) from the Greek mainland.\n\nErdogan said: \u201cWe don't have designs on anyone's rights, but we won't let any country take away our rights.\u201d\n\nHe also accused France of \u201cprovoking\u201d Greece and Cyprus into taking \u201cwrongful steps.\u201d\n\nErdogan also spoke on the phone with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has previously interceded to ease similar tensions between Turkey and Greece, and with EU Council President Charles Michel. Merkel and Michel also spoke on the phone with the Greek prime minister.\n\nThe Turkish leader later delivered a speech during which he warned of a \u201chigh price\u201d to be paid for any attack on the research vessel Oruc Reis, and he suggested that Turkey had already responded to an incident.\n\n\u201cWe have said, \u2018Do not attack our Oruc Reis. If you do, you will pay a heavy price.\u2019 And today, they got their first response,\u201d Erdogan said.\n\nTurkish officials did not immediately respond to requests for clarification on the president\u2019s comment. Greek officials said they were not aware of an incident.\n\nLater Thursday, Greece's Foreign Ministry issued a statement \u201cconcerning the Turkish claims,\u201d saying Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias would brief his EU colleagues Friday during an emergency Foreign Affairs Council session \u201con the true events during recent days concerning operational incidents in the area.\u201d\n\nFrance's Macron announced following a phone call with Mitsotakis late Wednesday that he decided to \u201ctemporarily reinforce the French military presence in the eastern Mediterranean in the coming days, in cooperation with European partners including Greece.\u201d\n\nGreece\u2019s NATO and European Union ally France is the EU\u2019s biggest military power. Complicating matters, Turkey \u2014 Greece\u2019s historic regional rival \u2014 is also a NATO member but has poor relations with France.\n\nIn a televised statement Wednesday, Mitsotakis warned of the \u201crisk of an accident\u201d in the patch of sea where the Greek and Turkish warships are gathered.\n\n\u201cIn such a case, responsibility lies upon the one who gives rise to these circumstances,\u201d he said. He added that Greece was not averse to \u201ceven the toughest dialogue,\u201d but that \u201cdialogue becomes irrelevant in a climate of tension and provocation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will never be the ones to escalate the situation. Yet, self-restraint is only one aspect of our power,\u201d Mitsotakis said. \u201cNo provocation will ... go unanswered.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Dendias visited Israel for talks on the matter, as well as on a project between Israel, Greece and Cyprus to transport Israeli gas from offshore reserves through an undersea pipeline to Italy.\n\nThe foreign minister said that during meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign MInister Gabi Ashkenazi, he \u201cmade it clear that Turkey's illicit behavior poses a threat to all countries in our region - a threat to security and stability.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu said Greece and Israel enjoy shared interests.\n\n\u201cObviously, we view gravely any aggression by anyone, including Turkey, in the eastern Mediterranean,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\nDendias is due to meet U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Vienna on Friday.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu held calls with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and several EU foreign ministers ahead of Friday's emergency EU meeting that will discuss the situation in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nCyprus President Nicos Anastasiades on Thursday urged Turkey to take its case to the international court of Justice at The Hague, or to accept arbitration. \u201cWhat would they have to lose if, as they claim, they\u2019re acting on the basis of international law?\u201d he said.\n\nAnastasiades said \u201cthere is no doubt\u201d that Turkey is in breach of the United Nations Charter and that its actions are contrary to international law.\n\nCypriot Foreign Minister Nikos Christoulides tweeted Thursday that Israel's Ashkenazi communicated with him to \u201creiterate Israel\u2019s support and solidarity in the face of escalating aggression in Cyprus\u2019 maritime zones.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFraser reported from Ankara.
