He lauded industrialists who had shown \u201cremarkable resilience\u201d in recovering from the extreme slowdown caused by the pandemic and the industrial labour, which returned to work with the same dedication.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=5.0", "description": "Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday called for readiness to combat the border threat from Pakistan and China.
