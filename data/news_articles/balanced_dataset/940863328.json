Accordingly, we have agreed to extend the limitation of non-essential travel at our shared land ports of entry through September 21. \u2014 Acting Secretary Chad Wolf (@DHS_Wolf) August 14, 2020\n\nAmericans who are returning to the U.S. and Canadians who are returning to Canada are exempted from the border closure.
