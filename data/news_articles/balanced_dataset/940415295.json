But, if we have to go to a remote learning plan, we have a good one in place, and we'll make best with what we have to do at that time,\" Meister said.", "METADATA": {"category": "news", "og": {"url": "https://www.wtol.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/four-county-career-return-plan/512-a1c66c7c-c3ee-4de9-9cbe-00bbd607df46", "title": "Four County Career Center plans to welcome 950+ students back to in-person learning", "description": "With jobs skill training a hands-on experience, school leaders believe the larger technical labs can allow their students to remain in person as long as possible.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.wtol.com/assets/WTOL/images/02025220-40d7-46ba-afb6-512395adfbff/02025220-40d7-46ba-afb6-512395adfbff_1140x641.jpg", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "article": {"published_time": "8/12/2020 9:53:57 PM"}, "site_name": "wtol.com", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"title": "Four County Career Center plans to welcome 950+ students back to in-person learning", "image": {"src": "https://media.wtol.com/assets/WTOL/images/02025220-40d7-46ba-afb6-512395adfbff/02025220-40d7-46ba-afb6-512395adfbff_360x203.jpg"}, "card": "summary", "site": "WTOL11Toledo", "description": "With jobs skill training a hands-on experience, school leaders believe the larger technical labs can allow their students to remain in person as long as possible.", "domain": "www.wtol.com"}, "viewport": "width=1170", "site": "wtol.com", "description": "The Archbold Ohio career center is planning to bring back all students to learn in person, five days a week", "fb": {"app_id": 168172380757522}}}}
