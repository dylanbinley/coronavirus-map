Imagine getting to the point of being happy to have found the remains of two among you,\" said Antonella Hitti on Facebook, after learning that the remains of her brother Najib, 27, and her cousin Charbel, 22, had been identified.\n\n\"We're not organising funerals before finding Charbel Karam,\" the third missing firefighter from the family, relative Mayane Nassif told AFP.\n\nThe remains of seven of the 10 firefighters who responded to the initial blaze have now been found.\n\nOn Thursday, rescue workers also found the body of a young man at the wheel of his car that had been thrown into the sea by the blast.\n\nPublic anger at the negligence that allowed hazardous materials to be left in a warehouse in the heart of the capital despite repeated warnings has reignited a protest movement that had largely fizzled out in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn the face of demands for his government to step down, Diab resigned on Monday.\n\nHis successor must be named by President Michel Aoun, the subject of increasing vitriol among protesters, on the basis of consultations with parliamentary blocs representing Lebanon's longstanding political parties -- the very ones that the protesters want to see gone.\n\n- No international probe -\n\nUndersecretary of State for Political Affairs, Hale, who met with Aoun on Friday, has called for the formation of a government \"that reflects and and responds to the will of the people and genuinely commits and acts for real change.\"\n\nFrance, whose defence minister also met with Aoun on Friday, has echoed those calls.\n\nFlorence Parly will later oversee the distribution of aid from the helicopter carrier Tonnerre, which docked in Beirut with food and construction materials.\n\nLebanese authorities named judge Fadi Sawan, known, according to judicial sources, for his independence and integrity, to lead investigations into the explosion.\n\nBut he will not himself question current and former ministers on the ammonium nitrate that was stocked at the port.\n\nThey will instead be referred to a special judicial body specialised in questioning government officials.\n\nOn Thursday, Hale announced the US Federal Bureau of Investigations would join the probe \"at the invitation\" of Lebanese authorities. Paris has opened its own investigation.\n\nLebanese authorities have rejected an international inquiry, despite demands for one both from within the country and from abroad.\n\nUN experts have called for a prompt and independent investigation into the explosion, expressing concern at the \"impunity\" they say Lebanese officials enjoy.\n\n\u00a9 2020 AFP", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/180c9a30-de23-11ea-885d-005056bff430/w:1280/p:16x9/a9ec9eb90586d69b0806a786b5e6fda092c7c38a.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "RFI", "type": "article", "title": "Beirut identifies its dead as judge named to lead probe - RFI", "description": "Beirut identifies its dead as judge named to lead probe", "url": "https://www.rfi.fr/en/wires/20200814-beirut-identifies-its-dead-judge-named-lead-probe"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113191652055439, "pages": 28764872018}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RFI.English/", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/RFI.English/", "published_time": "2020-08-14T11:33:48+00:00"}, "description": "Beirut identifies its dead as judge named to lead probe", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@RFI_En"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "RFI", "application-name": "RFI", "msapplication-TileColor": "#e2001a", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}}}
