New Jersey is requesting your service.\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Agriculture released instructions on Wednesday to slow the spread of the spotted lanternfly, an exotic invasive insect that feeds on 70 different types of plants and trees.\n\nThe bug is currently in its full adult stage and will begin laying egg masses in September. If residents notice the grayish putty-like masses, usually attached to trees, they should scrape them off, double bag them and throw them away. Additionally, they can be placed in alcohol, bleach or hand sanitizer.\n\nThe NJDA has an instructional video on how to kill the masses as well as a list of treatment options if residents have an infestation on their property.\n\n\u201cWe have been working diligently to slow the advance of this bug,\u201d NJDA Secretary Douglas Fisher said, according to a press release. \u201cWe are targeting areas where severe infestations have been confirmed, and we also encourage residents to destroy the Spotted Lanternfly if possible when they see it. It will take a combined effort to help keep this pest from spreading.\u201d\n\nNative to China and South Korea, the spotted lanternfly arrived to the U.S. in 2014 on a shipment to Berks County, Pennsylvania. After spreading rapidly, Pennsylvania placed 26 counties under quarantine, meaning that businesses, agencies and organizations traveling through the areas must obtain a permit for moving vehicles and products through the zone.\n\nCurrently, Mercer, Hunterdon, Warren, Burlington, Camden, Gloucester and Somerset counties are under quarantine in New Jersey. All vehicles crossing into the state from Pennsylvania must be inspected, as the bugs are known for hitchhiking on vehicles. Both states want travelers to check any items before they move them out of the quarantine area.\n\nThe department is also asking residents outside of the quarantine areas to report sightings by emailing Slf-plantindustry@ag.nj.gov or calling 609-406-6943.\n\nThough the bug does not pose a threat to humans or animals, it is deadly to plants because it feeds and extracts sap, creates wounds in trees, excretes honeydew which builds up sooty mold and impacts the overall quality of outdoor life.\n\n\u201cNJDA and USDA crews have worked to control the spread of this invasive pest,\u201d Joe Zoltowski, NJDA Plant Industry Division Director, said, according to a press release. \u201cIts ability to travel easily on any mode of transportation has allowed it to spread. We are asking residents to do their part by eliminating this bug whenever possible.\u201d\n\nPlease subscribe now and support the local journalism YOU rely on and trust.\n\nJosh Axelrod may be reached at jaxelrod@njadvancemedia.com.
