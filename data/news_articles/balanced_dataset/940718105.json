Ministry sources yesterday said the actual number of BoM teachers and workers had not been established.\n\nConsequently, Basic Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang has now instructed county directors to collect records on employment status of BoM teachers as at March 15.\n\nThe details are name of school, number of teachers, their TSC number and the county directors\u2019 remarks.\n\nEarlier in the year, the ministry had asked school heads to provide the same information.\n\n\u201cThe number they will collect doesn\u2019t tally with the truth on the ground,\u201d a principal told the Nation, adding that some schools did not give details of teachers who are not registered with the TSC. The circular, however, does not mention the support staff and it is believed that the ministry will use guidelines on staffing and salaries to allocate money for these workers.\n\nAccording to officials, schools will have the money in their accounts by the end of next week, with an official confirming to the Nation that the processing \u201cis 95 per cent done\u201d.\n\nEducation Chief Administrative Secretary Zack Kinuthia on Wednesday night took to Facebook to broadcast a video message on the funds.\n\n\u201cSurely money was released. However, there has been uproar that this money was again reversed back to the Treasury which, as I have established through the line PS (Dr Kipsang), was not reversed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis money was approved from the ministry and thus, reflected on the IFMIS* status. However, the Exchequer has to approve that money. They are in the final stages of approving the release of this money,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Kinuthia hinted that the money that will be sent will be less than the usual capitation of Sh1,470 per learner in primary schools and Sh22,244 per learner in secondary schools.\n\n\u201cYou may not get a hundred per cent of what you receive in normal times but you\u2019ll get a substantive and rational amount of money that befits you,\u201d he said.\n\nSchool managers are forced to employ teachers through BoMs to plug the biting teacher shortage in public schools that the government has failed to fix over the years. There are an estimated 300,000 qualified but jobless teachers in the country.\n\nApart from the teachers, other school workers like security and maintenance personnel have gone for months without salaries.\n\nSchools have also not paid suppliers for goods and services delivered before they were closed.\n\nThe government releases capitation funds to schools in three tranches and had only released the first one for first term.\n\nOn Thursday, Kenya Primary School Heads Association chairman Nicholas Gathemia said schools are still waiting for funds to be released.\n\n\u201cWe needs funds to pay BOM teachers, non-teaching staff and for mitigation of Covid-19,\u201d he told the Nation on phone.\n\nStimulus package\n\nMr Gathemia said primary schools had collected the data requested and submitted it to the ministry.\n\nSecondary heads who spoke to the Nation said the delay to release the funds has strained schools financially.\n\nKenya Secondary School Heads Association chairman Kahi Indimuli has been pushing for the funds to be released to schools without delay.\n\nHe said school heads are yet to be informed whether the money will be released either as capitation or a separate fund.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that they will use capitation to fund schools because each school has their own payroll,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ministry is yet to receive the money promised by Mr Yatani when he read the 2020/21 budget as part of the stimulus package intended to mitigate the effects of Covid-19.\n\n[email protected]; [email protected]", "METADATA": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "keywords": "education, George Magoha, funding, cash,Kahi Indimuli ,Zack Kinuthia ,Treasury,Belio Kipsang,Nemis", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,user-scalable=0", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Allocations were taken back after it emerged there was no data on BoM teachers and non-teaching staff.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Nation", "type": "article", "title": "Ministry blunder delays school cash", "url": "https://www.nation.co.ke/kenya/news/education/ministry-blunder-delays-school-cash--1918230", "description": "Allocations were taken back after it emerged there was no data on BoM teachers and non-teaching staff.", "locale": {"identifier": "en", "alternate": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14 00:07:25"}, "image": "https://www.nation.co.ke/resource/blob/1918232/6f44d773f001b1c5ad116eff400ec8c3/bar-data.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@dailynation", "title": "Ministry blunder delays school cash", "description": "Allocations were taken back after it emerged there was no data on BoM teachers and non-teaching staff.", "image": "https://www.nation.co.ke/resource/blob/1918232/6f44d773f001b1c5ad116eff400ec8c3/bar-data.jpg"}, "google-site-verification": "7PI23eF83yLrptihU4-C11bEaznAQl8mts5BfCS1W2U"}}}
