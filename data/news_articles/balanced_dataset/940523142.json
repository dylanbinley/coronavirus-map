Dozens of people were wounded.\n\n\"Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has buried the secular state of India and instead is giving rise to a Hindu state,\" said Qureshi. \"This is not an internal matter, it is a humanitarian issue,\" he said. Muslim minorities are not safe in India, insisted Qureshi.\n\nThe foreign minister urged Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and other global rights groups to take notice of the incident.\n\nQureshi further condemned the act of constructing a temple after demolishing a mosque - referring to the historic Babri Masjid site where a Hindu temple is now being built.\n\nThe foreign ministry took up the matter with officials of the Indian High Commission yesterday and will raise the issue of Islamophobia at every international forum as well, said Qureshi. He also mentioned Prime Minister Imran Khan's speech at the United Nations General Assembly session last year, where the premier raised the matters of Kashmir, climate change, money laundering and Islamophobia as central issues for the global community.\n\nOn Wednesday, Islamabad lodged a strong protest with India on a derogatory social media post against Islam in Bengaluru, the ministry of foreign affairs said.\n\n\"Pakistan has conveyed its strong condemnation to the Indian High Commission in Islamabad on the reported incident involving a derogatory social media post against the Holy Prophet (PBUH) by an extremist from the majority Hindu community in Bengaluru, Karnataka,\" the statement read.\n\nIt said that the offensive post against Islam has hurt Muslims and reflected the rising Islamophobia and targeting of minority communities in India.\n\nThe ministry said that the rising incidents of religious hate crime in India are a direct and inescapable consequence of the RSS-BJP's combined extremist ideology of \u2018Hindutva\u2019.\n\n\"The incident has been viewed with concern and the civil society in Pakistan has called for justice for the minority Muslim community in India,\" the statement added.\n\nPakistan called upon the government of India to investigate the incident and take immediate action against the perpetrators of religious hatred.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "ahrefs-site-verification": "80d91b866834629ca6d4329f97e56e8b3e664a02379ef1426de12c9cf7ce2c34", "fb": {"admins": 503171569, "app_id": 278477199157577, "pages": 111457038871331}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@etribune", "title": "Voicing concerns of Islamophobia at every international forum: FM Qureshi", "description": "Urges rights groups to take notice of recent violence in Bengaluru, India", "image": {"src": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/2189459-foreignministershahmahmoodqureshi-1585821513/2189459-foreignministershahmahmoodqureshi-1585821513.jpg"}}, "robots": "noodp", "csrf-token": "cT9Zu1S6d8rPC4puLQSjk2Jw8BcV8lWESJpZuTMh", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "url": "http://tribune.com.pk/story/2259353/voicing-concerns-of-islamophobia-at-every-international-forum-fm-qureshi", "site_name": "The Express Tribune", "type": "article", "title": "Voicing concerns of Islamophobia at every international forum: FM Qureshi | The Express Tribune", "description": "Urges rights groups to take notice of recent violence in Bengaluru, India", "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/2189459-foreignministershahmahmoodqureshi-1585821513/2189459-foreignministershahmahmoodqureshi-1585821513.jpg"}, "description": "Urges rights groups to take notice of recent violence in Bengaluru, India", "title": "Voicing concerns of Islamophobia at every international forum: FM Qureshi", "article": {"tag": "India", "publisher": "https://tribune.com.pk", "author": "https://tribune.com.pk/author/427", "section": "World", "published_time": "2020-08-13T10:47:48+00:00"}, "keywords": "Modi, Indo-Pak, BJP, RSS, Pakistan, Bengaluru, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Latest, India"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
