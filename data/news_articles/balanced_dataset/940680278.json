It found one in work related to equity, which has been an emphasis in the governments of other cities but not Spokane.\n\nThe job was envisioned as \u201cbeing a catalyst for movement forward for the City Council operations as well as just the city in general,\u201d Beggs said.\n\nGibilisco was born in Guatemala and moved to the United States when he was 10 years old.\n\n\u201cThat was a huge transition for me,\u201d he said.\n\nHis family arrived in California, but he considers Lincoln, Nebraska, his hometown. It\u2019s where he attended high school and studied political science and international studies at the University of Nebraska.\n\nGibilisco was introduced to equity-focused work in an internship with Nebraska Appleseed, a social justice nonprofit. His work was focused on racial justice, exploring and researching the demographics of different cities and towns throughout the state.\n\nLeaving Nebraska, Gibilisco got his first professional job in Tucson, Arizona, where he worked for a group that advocated for immigration reform. He recalls fielding a call from a victim of domestic violence who ended up in the hospital.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t call the police earlier because she was scared of being deported \u2013 that\u2019s how policy impacts everyday life,\u201d Gibilisco said.\n\nLater, Gibilisco returned to Nebraska Appleseed. He worked directly with different communities to address issues like unreported injuries in meatpacking plants.\n\nMost recently, Gibilisco worked for the city of Tacoma as its program development specialist for the Neighborhood and Community Services Department. He served as a liaison to neighborhood groups and helped ensure diverse members of the community were being heard, and that the city was taking a \u201cholistic view\u201d of issues like health, transportation and access to education.\n\nMore than 70 people applied for the job in Spokane. Gibilisco was the right fit because he has experience not only in helping a city implement equitable policies but also, in his previous work, \u201cgrassroots organizing and community-building,\u201d Beggs said.\n\n\u201cNo matter how well-intentioned city leaders are \u2026 they don\u2019t necessarily have much lived experience or are connected relationally with people who do,\u201d Beggs said.\n\nGibilisco said his job will entail not only connecting with local organizations and their leaders, \u201cbut also community members and residents and understanding their needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the part I\u2019m most excited about \u2013 is really getting to know the community,\u201d Gibilisco said.\n\nSpokane is overwhelmingly white \u2013 about 85%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau \u2013 but that was not a deterrent to Gibilisco. Spokane, actually, reminds him of Lincoln.\n\n\u201cI have lived in different communities with different makeups,\u201d Gibilisco said.\n\nGibilisco already has his work cut out for him.\n\nCity Council members and staff will undergo training on equity and inclusion, according to Beggs, which it has not formally done in the past.\n\n\u201cWe should get our own house in order,\u201d Beggs said.\n\nBeggs also wants Gibilisco to help address the city\u2019s hiring process, both for Civil Service positions and those exempt from it. Even in hiring for the equity manager position, Beggs said he was surprised to learn that there is not a robust outreach to marginalized communities.\n\nGibilisco has been tasked with helping the council consider its actions through an equity lens. That includes its ongoing work on criminal justice reform and police reform, but also other issues as they come up.\n\n\u201cThere might be policies and procedures that in their language that are race neutral, or gender neutral \u2026 but in their impact, they have a negative, disproportionate (consequence),\u201d Beggs said.\n\n\u201cThere will be too much to do \u2013 the challenge will be how do you strategically pick,\u201d he added.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Alex Gibilisco is ready for his new role as equity manager for the Spokane City Council.", "fb": {"app_id": 316254480466}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.spokesman.com/icons/mstile-144x144.43ebfcead1fd.png", "msapplication-config": "https://static.spokesman.com/browserconfig.1f7054e82d2f.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"url": "https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/aug/12/city-council-hires-new-manager-of-equity/", "title": "'There will be too much to do': Spokane City Council hires new manager of equity", "type": "article", "image": "https://media.spokesman.com/graphics/2018/07/sr_placeholder.png", "description": "Alex Gibilisco is ready for his new role as equity manager for the Spokane City Council.", "site_name": "Spokesman.com", "updated_time": "2020-08-13T21:57:21.870204"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/aug/12/city-council-hires-new-manager-of-equity/", "title": "'There will be too much to do': Spokane City Council hires new manager of equity", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://thumb.spokesman.com/HD5kUabgICh7mBhCn_IvFoODrEo=/1200x0/old-media.spokesman.com/photos/2020/08/13/5f35a2745c6ee.image.jpg", "description": "Alex Gibilisco is ready for his new role as equity manager for the Spokane City Council.", "site": "SpokesmanReview"}, "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
