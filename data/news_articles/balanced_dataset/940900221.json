In contrast, Honglian hybrid rice can create bumper harvest not only in China but also in many other countries like Pakistan,\" Zhu Renshan said.\n\nHonglian hybrid rice adapts well to Pakistan's climate. Even under extreme high temperature or changeable weather, the seed setting rate is still stable, much higher than that of other hybrid rice varieties.\n\nMoreover, Honglian rice seed production costs less therefore farmers can get higher income at the same investment.\n\nPunjab Agriculture Extension Director Shahzad Sabir and professors from the University of Punjab praised Honglian hybrid rice's feature of heat-tolerance and adaptability, which suits Pakistan's climate.\n\nHaving seen Honglian hybrid rice do well in the six experimental plots in Pakistan, professionals of the two countries are confident in its future performance when sowed at a large scale.\n\nNext, besides lifting local cultivation, the research centre is planning a series of technical cooperation and scientific research. Seed production technologies will be gradually transferred to Pakistan. Furthermore, they will also provide technical support on pest control.\n\nThough the Covid-19 pandemic is still wreaking havoc in the world, Pak-Sino cooperation related to Honglian hybrid rice keeps progressing.\n\nEarlier this year, the research team of Wuhan University delivered seeds from China to Pakistan via international logistics, and the rice will be harvested in October.\n\nTHIS ARTICLE ORIGINALLY APPEARED ON THE CHINA ECONOMIC NET\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, August 15th, 2020.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "ahrefs-site-verification": "80d91b866834629ca6d4329f97e56e8b3e664a02379ef1426de12c9cf7ce2c34", "fb": {"admins": 503171569, "app_id": 278477199157577, "pages": 111457038871331}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@etribune", "title": "Pakistan, China to set up hybrid rice research centre", "description": "Joint centre will boost yield to improve domestic food security and supplement export", "image": {"src": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/rice/rice.jpg"}}, "robots": "noodp", "csrf-token": "WCDk8AuzXCXX03Jii4rQXSejtcvhUUS3rkULTRfD", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "url": "http://tribune.com.pk/story/2259545/pakistan-china-to-set-up-hybrid-rice-research-centre", "site_name": "The Express Tribune", "type": "article", "title": "Pakistan, China to set up hybrid rice research centre | The Express Tribune", "description": "Joint centre will boost yield to improve domestic food security and supplement export", "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/rice/rice.jpg"}, "description": "Joint centre will boost yield to improve domestic food security and supplement export", "title": "Pakistan, China to set up hybrid rice research centre", "article": {"publisher": "https://tribune.com.pk", "author": "https://tribune.com.pk/author/190", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2020-08-14T19:21:02+00:00"}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": []}}
