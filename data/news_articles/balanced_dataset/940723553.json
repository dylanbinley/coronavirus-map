(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday continued to suggest that the massive explosion that killed at least 135 people in Lebanon might have been a deliberate attack, even as officials in Lebanon and his own defense chief said it\u2019s believed to have be an accident.\n\n\u201cWhatever happened, it\u2019s terrible, but they don\u2019t really know what it is,\u201d Trump insisted. \u201cNobody knows yet.\u201d\n\nInvestigators probing the deadly blast that ripped across Beirut on Tuesday are focused on possible negligence in the storage of tons of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive fertilizer, in a waterfront warehouse. The Lebanese government ordered the house arrest of several port officials in connection with the explosion, which killed at least 135 people and injured 5,000 more.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump called the explosion a \u201cterrible attack\u201d and said American generals told him it was likely caused by a bomb. \u201cThey seem to think it was an attack,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was a bomb of some kind, yes.\u201d\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper contradicted the president Wednesday, saying most people believe the explosion \u201cwas an accident, as reported.\u201d\n\nBut later in the day, Trump insisted nobody knows for sure.\n\n\u201cHow can you say accident if somebody left some terrible explosive-type devices and things around perhaps \u2014 perhaps it was that. Perhaps it was an attack,\u201d Trump told reporters during a White House briefing. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody can say right now. We\u2019re looking into it very strongly right now.\n\n\u201cSome people think it was an attack and some people think it wasn\u2019t. In any event, it was a terrible event and a lot of people were killed and a tremendous number of people were badly wounded, injured. And we\u2019re standing with that country. \u201d\n\n\u201cBut whether it was a bomb intentionally set off -- it ended up being a bomb,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no, I\u2019ve heard it both ways. It could have been an accident and it could have also been something that was very offensive.\u201d\n\nWhite House chief of staff Mark Meadows defended the president, saying Trump only told reporters on Tuesday what military officials had told him. \u201cThe president shared with the American people what he was briefed on, with 100% certainty I can tell you that,\u201d Meadows told CNN.\n\nBut U.S. officials on Wednesday couldn\u2019t identify any \u201cgenerals\u201d who delivered any such Beirut message to the president. And while none would comment publicly, some noted that defense and intelligence officials didn\u2019t have enough information about the explosion to make any statement about the cause on Tuesday evening.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis is not the first time defense officials have been caught off-guard by Trump or scrambled to try to explain something he said without appearing to contradict their commander in chief.\n\nEarly in his presidency, Trump announced on Twitter that he was going to ban transgender service members, a move Pentagon leaders didn\u2019t know about. And many were caught by surprise when he suddenly announced he was pulling all troops out of Syria.\n\nMore recently, defense officials struggled to explain what Trump meant when he suggested the military was planning to play a role in distributing the coronavirus vaccine, something they had no plan to do. And they openly split with the president when he said he wanted to invoke the Insurrection Act and deploy troops to tamp down protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd.\n\nFrom video and other evidence, experts suggest that fireworks and ammonium nitrate were the fuel that ignited the explosion that rocked the Lebanese capital. The scale of the damage \u2014 from the area of the explosion at the port of Beirut to the windows blown out miles away \u2014 resembled other blasts involving the chemical compound commonly used as an agricultural fertilizer.\n\nThe compound typically does not detonate on its own and requires another ignition source. That likely came from a fire that engulfed what initially appeared to be fireworks stored at the port. The Lebanese government said it was putting an unspecified number of Beirut port officials under house arrest pending an investigation into how 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate came to be stored at the port for years.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Beirut said at least one American citizen was killed and several more were injured in the explosion. \u201cWe are working closely with local authorities to determine if any additional U.S. citizens were affected,\u201d the embassy said in a statement Wednesday. The embassy said all its employees are safe and accounted for.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke Wednesday with Lebanon\u2019s Prime Minister Hassan Diab to convey U.S. condolences to the Lebanese people, according to State Department deputy spokesperson Cale Brown. The U.S. was preparing to provide humanitarian aid and medical or other supplies to the Lebanese people, Esper said online during this year\u2019s Aspen Security Forum.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "theme-color": "#dedede", "msapplication-config": "browserconfig.xml", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday continued to suggest that the massive explosion that killed at least 135 people in Lebanon might have been a deliberate attack, even as...", "keywords": "Beirut,International News,Middle East,Lebanon,Politics,Racial injustice,Virus Outbreak,Donald Trump", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ap", "title": "Trump again says Lebanon blast might have been attack", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday continued to suggest that the massive explosion that killed at least 135 people in Lebanon might have been a deliberate attack, even as...", "image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/752c5d3993944a86bddf517013b5c081/3000.jpeg", "url": "https://apnews.com/6e970282968b2f3fce3ea0ad351c8049"}, "og": {"title": "Trump again says Lebanon blast might have been attack", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday continued to suggest that the massive explosion that killed at least 135 people in Lebanon might have been a deliberate attack, even as...", "type": "article", "url": "https://apnews.com/6e970282968b2f3fce3ea0ad351c8049", "image": {"identifier": "https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/752c5d3993944a86bddf517013b5c081/3000.jpeg", "width": 4500, "height": 3000}, "site_name": "AP NEWS"}, "fb": {"app_id": 870613919693099, "pages": 249655421622}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-05T15:58:02Z", "modified_time": "2020-08-06T00:20:09Z", "section": "Beirut", "tag": "Donald Trump"}, "google-site-verification": "XvG-YKlyyPmG2x0J9-rdS-zI8LhL4d75ZQoccETD2qA"}}}
