I guess the people in the cells are exceptional. It is like COVID-19 doesn\u2019t infect them and this is despite the fact that new suspects are brought in every day without testing.\n\n\u201cHowever, we had an incident just once. There was a Chinese man who was a gold miner who fell ill. He was taken to a hospital and tested positive for COVID-19; so. he was hurriedly released.\n\n\u201cHe was in the Force Intelligence Bureau Department. So, only the suspects in that cell were tested. We were all at risk of getting infected with COVID-19.\u201d\n\nOn why he was detained, Babatunde said he was disappointed that former President Jonathan could order his arrest because he was one of his biggest supporters.\n\nPresident Goodluck Jonathan. (Punch)\n\n\u201cThe funny thing is that I even tweeted good things about Goodluck Jonathan a few weeks before my arrest. I said Jonathan\u2019s administration was better than that of the current President. So, I was shocked, but this is Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he was still a fan of Jonathan, Babatunde responded laughingly, \u201cMay God help us.\u201d\n\nThe student, who is said to be an orphan also said then police officers that came to his uncle\u2019s house to arrest him did not tell his uncle the reason for his arrest.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt was when I got to the station that I was asked what I did to offend Goodluck Jonathan.\u201d\n\nThe final year student of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology also said he complied with the Twitter rules guiding the creating of parody accounts on Twitter, adding that he has never used the account to defraud anyone.\n\n\u201cI set it up just to make the timeline fun. I have my own personal twitter account, but I just wanted to \u2018catch cruise\u2019. It was my personal Twitter account that I converted. It was the same handle @jayythedope, but I changed my picture and profile name to that of Jonathan.\n\n\u201cI left my cover picture as @Jayythedope. All my information and personal email address were included in my bio. It was not an attempt to impersonate the former President. I also stated clearly that I was not GEJ. It was just a parody account. I didn\u2019t expect things to blow up the way they did.\n\nThe student\u2019s lawyer, Tope Akinyode, said Jonathan had already written through his lawyers to withdraw his complaint of impersonation.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "DC.Identifier": "844fa8f5-813a-49a4-991c-20d5c1054af7", "description": "Babatunde said he was disappointed that former President Jonathan could order his arrest because he was one of his biggest supporters.", "og": {"title": "Final year student arrested for creating Jonathan\u2019s parody account says he spent 82 days in detention", "description": "Babatunde said he was disappointed that former President Jonathan could order his arrest because he was one of his biggest supporters.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/gVSktkpTURBXy8zY2QyY2YzMDM2ODQ1NGRmZjlhMmE5YzYwNzgyMGExMC5qcGeSlQNHAM0CwM0BjJMFzQSwzQJ2", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.pulse.ng/news/metro/final-year-student-arrested-for-creating-jonathans-parody-account-says-he-spent-82/nq3z130", "type": "article", "site_name": "Pulse Nigeria", "locale": "en_EN"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-12 23:49:00+0200"}, "fb": {"app_id": 357752217891027, "pages": 163781703715266}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Babatunde said he was disappointed that former President Jonathan could order his arrest because he was one of his biggest supporters.", "title": "Final year student arrested for creating Jonathan\u2019s parody account says he spent 82 days in detention", "site": "PulseNigeria247", "image": "https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/1_XktkpTURBXy8zY2QyY2YzMDM2ODQ1NGRmZjlhMmE5YzYwNzgyMGExMC5qcGeSlQNHAM0CwM0BjJMFzQHgzQFo"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#000000"}}}
