Now it looks like he\u2019s finally going to get both\u2026 er, kind of. TikTok Trump impersonator Sarah Cooper is officially getting her own comedy-variety special on Netflix and if her viral videos are anything to go by, we bet the show will feature just a smidgen of her patented Trump mockery.\n\nCooper, who got a little taste of the big leagues with her guest-hosting stint on Jimmy Kimmel Live! earlier this week, will helm a show called Sarah Cooper: Everything\u2019s Fine, which Netflix has described as a, \u201cvariety special full of vignettes dealing with issues of politics, race, gender, class, and other light subjects.\u201d\n\nThe show, which is set to premiere in autumn, will also have special guest interviews and sketches.\n\nIt\u2019s true! I\u2019m getting a Netflix special!

Cooper herself and Saturday Night Live alum (and on-call Kamala Harris impersonator) Maya Rudolph, who is a partner in Lyonne\u2019s production company Animal Pictures, will executive produce as well.\n\nHow to bible pic.twitter.com/Kib5lTdlRt \u2014 Sarah Cooper (@sarahcpr) June 3, 2020\n\nThough she actually scored a Twitter block from the president way back in 2017, until Cooper started parroting the president on TikTok, she was an aspiring comedian and relatively inoffensive Google employee. As she revealed in her Vanity Fair profile in July, aside from aggressively responding to Trump tweets, she was all about finding consensus in the workplace. \u201cBeing a Black woman, I could never get away with talking like that in a meeting, let alone as president of the United States,\u201d she said of the original audio to her videos.\n\nRELATED: Ciara celebrates Black excellence in \u2018Rooted\u2019 video\n\nCooper skyrocketed to viral internet fame in the spring when the 42-year-old took to TikTok with her lip-syncing of Trump\u2019s often rambling and incoherent soundbites. Her hilarious lampooning and satirizing of the POTUS even has had some speculating she\u2019s the impetus behind his wish to ban TikTok in the United States, something Cooper herself couldn\u2019t help but mock.\n\nCooper\u2019s TikTok \u201cHow to Medical\u201d has been viewed more than 20 million times on the platform.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "TikTok star and Trump impersonator Sarah Cooper is officially getting her own special.", "google-site-verification": "SVTb1Z_Uvzk18cAGAhUb6C2qPS-UZH6Zuiei5ZXMr38", "datePublished": "2020-08-13T14:47:14-04:00", "fb": {"pages": 118691728090, "app_id": 384569415349244}, "twitter": {"site": "@etalkCTV", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Viral Trump impersonator Sarah Cooper is getting her own Netflix special", "description": "TikTok star and Trump impersonator Sarah Cooper is officially getting her own special."}, "og": {"title": "Viral Trump impersonator Sarah Cooper is getting her own Netflix special", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.theloop.ca/viral-trump-impersonator-sarah-cooper-is-getting-her-own-netflix-special/", "description": "TikTok star and Trump impersonator Sarah Cooper is officially getting her own special.", "site_name": "etalk", "image": "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sarah-cooper-netflix.jpg"}, "author": "Christine Estima"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
