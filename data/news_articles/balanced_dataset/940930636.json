Russia and China strongly opposed the resolution, but didn\u2019t need to use their vetoes.\n\nThe UN Security Council ( Photo: AP )\n\nThe Trump administration has said repeatedly it will not allow the arms embargo provision in the Security Council resolution endorsing the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and six major powers to expire as scheduled Oct. 18.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the defeat of the resolution ahead of a very brief virtual council meeting to reveal the vote.\n\nHe said Israel and the six Arab Gulf nations who supported the extension \u201cknow Iran will spread even greater chaos and destruction if the embargo expires, but the Security Council chose to ignore them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States will never abandon our friends in the region who expected more from the Security Council,\u201d Pompeo said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to work to ensure that the theocratic terror regime does not have the freedom to purchase and sell weapons that threaten the heart of Europe, the Middle East and beyond.\u201d\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Pompeo ( Photo: AFP )\n\nU.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft said \u201cthe United States stands sickened \u2014 but not surprised \u2014 as the clear majority of council members gave the green light to Iran to buy and sell all manner of conventional weapons.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe council\u2019s failure today will serve neither peace nor security,\u201d she warned. \u201cRather, it will fuel greater conflict and drive even more insecurity.\u201d\n\nPompeo suggested the U.S. would invoke the \u201csnap back\u201d mechanism in the 2015 nuclear deal that would restore all UN sanctions on Iran \u2014 and Craft said the United States will go ahead \u201cin the coming days\u201d and keep America\u2019s \u201cpromise to stop at nothing to extend the arms embargo.\u201d\n\n\u201cSnap back\u201d was envisioned in the event Iran was proven to be in violation of the accord, under which it received billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guard testing ballistic missiles during a military exercise ( Photo: AFP PHOTO / Iran's Revolutionary Guard via SEPAH NEWS )\n\nPresident Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear agreement between Iran and six major powers, known as the JCPOA, in 2018. But the U.S. circulated a six-page memo Thursday from State Department lawyers outlining why the United States remains part of the 2015 Security Council resolution that endorsed the deal and still has the right to use the `snap back\u2019 provision.\n\nThe five other powers \u2014 Russia, China, United Kingdom, France and Germany \u2014 remain committed to the deal, and diplomats from several of these countries have voiced concern that extending the arms embargo would lead Iran to exit the nuclear agreement and speed up its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n\nChina\u2019s UN ambassador, Zhang Jun, reiterated after the vote the Chinese contention that since the U.S. is no longer party to the 2015 agreement, it is \u201cineligible to demand the Security Council invoke a snap back.\u201d He said the overwhelming majority of council members \u201cbelieve the U.S. attempt has no legal basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cShould the U.S. insist regardless of international opinion, it is doomed to fail like today,\u201d Zhang said in a statement, adding that the vote showed \u201cthat unilateralism receives no support and bullying will fail.\u201d\n\nIranian Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi ( Photo: Twitter )\n\nIranian Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi accused the U.S. of seeking to use the arms embargo \u201cas a pretext of killing the JCPOA forever through the snap back mechanism.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we have already stated, imposition of any sanctions or restrictions on Iran by the Security Council will be met severely by Iran and our options are not limited. And the United States and any entity which may assist it or acquiesce in its illegal behavior, will bear the full responsibility,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile voting on the U.S. draft resolution was under way, Russia said President Vladimir Putin called for a meeting of leaders of the five permanent members of the Security Council along with Germany and Iran to avoid escalation over U.S. attempts to extend the Iranian arms embargo.\n\nIn a statement released by the Kremlin, Putin said \u201cthe question is urgent,\u201c adding that the goal of the video conference would be \u201cto outline steps to avoid confrontation and exacerbation of the situation in the UN Security Council,\u201d\n\nMembers of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) march during the annual military parade marking the anniversary of the outbreak of the devastating 1980-1988 war with Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq, in the capital Tehran ( Photo: AFP )\n\n\u201dIf the leaders are fundamentally ready for a conversation, we propose to promptly coordinate the agenda,\u201d Putin said. \u201cThe alternative is to further build up tension, to increase the risk of conflict. This development must be avoided.\u201d\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office confirmed France\u2019s \u201cavailability in principle\u201d to Putin\u2019s proposal. \u201cWe have in the past deployed initiatives in the same spirit,\u201d it said.\n\nWhether Trump and the others agree to participate in the meeting remains to be seen.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. envoy Craft said in an interview with The Associated Press that the United States is \u201ckeeping the space open\u201d for talks with Britain, France and Germany, as well as Russia and China.\n\nShe urged the three European nations that support the nuclear deal \u2014 Britain, France and Germany \u2014 to put in writing their ideas to extend the expiring arms embargo on Iran, indicating the Trump administration may be willing compromise on its demand for an indefinite extension. She said they had mentioned a six-month or one-year extension.\n\nU.S. ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft ( Photo: AFP )\n\nEuropean diplomats said the three countries share the U.S. goal of maintaining the arms embargo but need to find a compromise with Russia and China. The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity because discussions have been private, said the Europeans had offered a compromise proposal but the U.S., Russia and China showed no willingness to compromise.\n\nThe U.S. administration wants to end the Iran nuclear agreement before the American elections Nov. 3, the Europeans said, pointing to the time pressure the U.S. is exerting since the arms embargo doesn\u2019t expire until October and there would still be time for negotiations.\n\nGermany\u2019s deputy UN ambassador, G\u00fcnter Sautter, said after the vote that Germany remains committed to the nuclear deal, but remains deeply concerned about Iran\u2019s transfers of weapon to Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq in violation of the 2015 council resolution.\n\nHe said Germany has been engaging with council members and is ready to continue discussions \u201cin order to find a pragmatic way forward, which addresses our collective concerns.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "application-name": "ynetnews", "description": "Washington's resolution to extend weapons ban resoundingly defeated; Pompeo says Israel, Gulf states expect Tehran to \u2018spread chaos and destruction\u2019 after embargo lifted in October", "channel-name": "News", "publishedPageId": 42277, "fb": {"app_id": 646875168792966}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "UN votes to end arms embargo on Iran, despite U.S. demands", "description": "Washington's resolution to extend weapons ban resoundingly defeated; Pompeo says Israel, Gulf states expect Tehran to \u2018spread chaos and destruction\u2019 after embargo lifted in October", "site_name": "ynetnews", "url": "https://www.ynetnews.com/article/H1obilHfD", "image": "https://besttv232-ynet-images1-prod.cdn.it.best-tv.com/picserver5/crop_images/2020/07/26/S1Sl11LseD/S1Sl11LseD_1_20_640_381_large.jpg", "published_time": "2020-08-15 09:15:55.139680", "IsPay": 0}, "vr": {"title": "UN votes to end arms embargo on Iran, despite U.S. demands", "published_time": "2020-08-15 09:15:55.139680", "image": "https://besttv232-ynet-images1-prod.cdn.it.best-tv.com/picserver5/crop_images/2020/07/26/S1Sl11LseD/S1Sl11LseD_1_20_640_381_large.jpg", "author": "Associated Press", "category": "Middle East"}, "sub-channel-ID": "\u201c3082/9733\u201d", "sub-channel-name": "News/Mideast News", "keywords": "israel, news, yedioth, ahronoth, hebrew, jewish, arab, palestine, intifada, update, search, israeli, newspaper, jerusalem, tel aviv, yediot, aharonoth, middle east, west bank, quotes, portal, maccabi, hapoel, beitar,  www.ynet.co.il"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
