They were receiving his dead body.\n\nThe only information they received was that he died July 1, 2020, at the B.K. Hospital, Bhuj. Or so stated the death certificate, a bilingual document in English and Gujrati, issued on July 9 by the government of the state of Gujrat. No postmortem was carried out.\n\nThe Indian maritime security forces had arrested Bhatti, along with other fishermen, on January 8 and carted them off to prison.\n\nThe bureaucratic paperwork facilitating Bhatti\u2019s last journey was replete with ironies.\n\n\u201cDead body of the deceased is not required for investigation purpose (sic) hence there is no objection for repatriation of mortal remains\u2026\u201d stated the \u2018no objection certificate\u2019 issued on July 27 by the police in Bhuj, district headquarters of Kutch district, Gujarat.\n\nPakistan issued an emergency passport the same day \u201cvalid for a single journey\u201d. Mode of transport: \u201cby foot/by road.\u201d\n\nThe families of those who die in custody across the border deal with similar delays in getting the bodies of their loved ones back. In early 2018 alone, at least three Pakistani fishermen and one Indian fisherman died as prisoners in the other country.\n\nAlso read: In Border Villages of Punjab, a Life of Exclusion and Neglect\n\nThe killing of the Indian national, Sarabjit Singh, in a Pakistani prison shortly before he was due to be released (the repatriation of another convicted Indian spy Surjeet Singh earlier instead of Sarabjit had caused massive confusion) became a high profile case, and was followed by the retaliatory killing of Pakistani national Sanaullah in a jail in Jammu.\n\nThese tragic episodes encapsulate the tit-for-tat relationship between India and Pakistan that Kunda Dixit and I summed up in a cartoon we did when the two countries tested nuclear weapons in 1998.\n\nThey also symbolise much of what is wrong between the neighbours, whose relations are a far cry from what Pakistan\u2019s founding father M.A. Jinnah had envisaged. The two countries, he told a reporter, would be like the US and Canada \u2013 open borders, freedom of trade and travel. The very different reality has long stymied development in the region.\n\nThe increasingly rigid visa regime prohibits cross-border tourism. Thousands of divided family members on either side can\u2019t meet. Imagine being unable to attend a loved one\u2019s wedding or funeral a few hours\u2019 drive away because you can\u2019t get a visa.\n\nIn this age of instant news, Bhatti\u2019s death wasn\u2019t reported on either side until reports about his body\u2019s repatriation surfaced.\n\nThat was, ironically, the day that M. Tahseen in Pakistan and M.J. Viyajan in India dispatched a letter on behalf of the PIPFPD, the Pakistan India People\u2019s Forum for Peace and Democracy, to prime ministers Imran Khan and Narendra Modi, endorsed by hundreds on either side, urging them to release fisherfolk and women cross-border prisoners ahead of Pakistan and India\u2019s upcoming Independence Day celebrations, on August 14 and 15.\n\nMany Indians and Pakistanis at home and abroad commemorate these days together in a conscious defiance of the \u2018enemy country\u2019 narrative. They point out that both countries tested nuclear weapons in 1998 but still can\u2019t feed and educate their populace. The coronavirus pandemic has exposed these shortcomings starkly.\n\nThe tragedy of Bhatti, Vijayan tells me, \u201chad a very dampening effect on the campaign and many of us.\u201d But, he adds, \u201cour letter is making some serious impacts even in Delhi power corridors\u201d.\n\nAlso read: How India\u2019s Fishermen Get Caught Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\n\nIndia and Pakistan treat their own prisoners badly enough, stuffing them in overcrowded jails and subjecting them to the same colonial-era penal system.\n\nForeign nationals have things worse. They suffer \u201cblanket denial of bail and parole, curbs on communication with family and lawyers, suspension of regular hearings in courts, delayed consular access, suspension of international flights,\u201d notes Madhurima Dhanuka, Programme Head Prisons Reforms, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative.\n\nFor Indians in Pakistani prison or vice versa, things are even worse. \u201cWe treat each other\u2019s detained nationals like prisoners of war\u201d said M.A. Shah of the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated the situation. Families frantic about their loved ones\u2019 safety, with no means of communication.\n\nPakistan today holds 270 Indian fishermen and 54 civilians, and India has 97 Pakistani fishermen and 265 civilian prisoners, according to the twice-yearly prisoner list that both countries have been exchanging since 2008. The last one such lists were exchanged July 1. Ironically again, that was the day Bhatti died.\n\nA month after his death, Bhatti\u2019s body was sent a thousand kilometres across from Gujarat to the Wagah border in Punjab. The humanitarian Edhi Foundation of Pakistan that facilitates prisoner exchanges arranged for him to be on the Lahore-Karachi flight.\n\nFishermen who had died in cross-border custody used to be sent home on a direct Karachi-Mumbai flight, a little over an hour and half. This is no longer operative.\n\nThe repatriated living follow the same convoluted route via Wagah border as Bhatti\u2019s mortal remains, except that they don\u2019t get to fly. It\u2019s the bus or train for them.\n\nWagah border is where the Pakistan Rangers and Indian Border Security Force personnel famously undertake their aggressive goose-steps in a choreographed, daily flag-lowering ceremony at sunset. The spectacle in verdant agricultural Punjab is a world away from the shared coastline where fish workers like Bhatti barely eke out a living, in Pakistan or India. They belong to the same ethnic community.\n\nMany are the sole breadwinners of their families, largely unlettered, plying the traditional trade of their forefathers. They know the risks of the sea.\n\nThe danger of storms pales before the border patrols of the other side who arrest them and confiscate their catch and boats. But most fisherfolk know no other way and have no skills to enter another trade.\n\nArrested fishermen\u2019s families suffer the trauma of not knowing their whereabouts for weeks or months and are vulnerable to starvation. Their children, often the first generation in this community to be educated, are forced to drop out of and take up jobs when their fathers go missing at sea.\n\nBoth countries agree that fishermen inadvertently crossing the unmarked maritime border between the two countries are not criminals or spies and should be released once this has been verified.\n\nIn 2008, they signed an Agreement on Consular Access that stipulates the release and repatriation of detained persons from the other country \u201cwithin one month of confirmation of their national status and completion of sentences\u201d. They are also supposed to \u201cprovide consular access within three months\u201d to cross-border prisoners.\n\nAlso read: As Another Fisherman Dies Across the Border, India and Pakistan Need to Work on Their Priorities\n\nThis rarely happens. The undertrial period can be longer than the actual sentence. It can take months to verify the prisoners\u2019 identities. Almost invariably poor and unlettered, they rarely have any documentation.\n\n\u201cNearly 100 of the Indian prisoners have completed their sentences and their nationality has been confirmed, but they\u2019re still in jail,\u201d said activist and journalist Jatin Desai in Mumbai, former general secretary in Mumbai of the PIPFPD, the Pakistan India People\u2019s Forum for Peace and Democracy.\n\nThe region\u2019s largest and oldest people-to-people group, launched in 1995 \u2013 of which I am a founding member \u2013 the PIPFPD has long been pushing back against the \u2018us versus them\u2019 binary that dominates the narrative. Peace activists want the states to institute a \u201cno-arrest\u201d policy at sea and equip the fishermen\u2019s boats with GPS devices.\n\nThe India Pakistan joint judicial committee on prisoners formed in 2008 has echoed these demands. Comprising four retired judges from each country, the committee used to meet prisoners jailed on either side twice a year, until the last meeting in October 2013. Efforts to revive it five years later led to India nominating its members. Pakistan has yet to do so.\n\nA few days after Bhatti was buried, hundreds of fisherfolk demonstrated in Karachi against his death. They burnt an effigy of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused Indian authorities of killing Bhatti. News reports on either side highlighted the demonstration and its allegations, the symptom rather than the cause of the issue.\n\nIf Khan and Modi let the fishermen go, it would give the region something to celebrate in these dark times. Prisoner repatriation, say experts, is a \u2018low-hanging fruit\u2019 that can counter the dominant belligerent narrative.\n\nOn a human level, releasing the fishermen will enable hundreds of families to focus on rebuilding their lives as both countries celebrate their independence days. \u201cLet the fishermen too have their freedoms back,\u201d said Jatin Desai.\n\nThe move would be all the more meaningful at these times of increased hardships caused by a global pandemic.\n\nBeena Sarwar is a journalist, editor and filmmaker.
