Will Bali really open to international arrivals on 11 September \u2013 and if it does, who will visit? By Gary Bowerman\n\n\u201cThe Chinese don\u2019t come now. We don\u2019t know when they will return.\u201d\n\nIt was the week after Chinese New Year, and the driver guiding me through beautiful eastern Bali had descended into gloom. The coronavirus was not yet a pandemic, but his industry was starting to suffer. \u201cThe Chinese like to take tours to different places. Now, no.\u201d he said.\n\nFast forward to August 2020, and Asia\u2019s eyes are refocusing on Bali. The holiday island\u2019s proposed reopening to inbound tourism on 11 September is a highly anticipated test case in South East Asia, where most borders remain firmly closed.\n\nCan Indonesia successfully relaunch its signature tourism island amid the country\u2019s continuing struggle to contain the coronavirus?\n\n2020 Options Are Running Out\n\nAsia is collectively willing for some substantive tourism news that extends beyond hopeful headlines about travel bubbles.\n\nThe past 5 months have been miserable for the region\u2019s travel sector, and progress is elusive. In Vietnam, the Danang outbreak spread fear through a nation presumed COVID-safe. Case infections are spiralling in India, Indonesia and Philippines, while Japan and Hong Kong confront new waves. Parts of Australia and New Zealand are back in lockdown\n\nMeanwhile, Taiwan\u2019s media called for cross-border travel to be ruled out for 2020, and Macao\u2019s tourism authority said international arrivals may not return until mid-2021. Thailand appears in no hurry to welcome back tourists, and Malaysia\u2019s health minister said that a new infection wave is \u201cinevitable\u201d were the country to reopen its borders.\n\nWith options running out for 2020, Asia\u2019s tourism hopes are loaded onto Bali\u2019s scenic shoulders.\n\nWhy Bali, Why Now?\n\nIn mid-June, Balinese authorities said the island\u2019s reopening would occur in three phases.\n\nFirstly, local tourism businesses and attractions reopened on 9 July.\n\nOn 31 July, the start of a long-weekend break for the Eid al-Adha holiday, saw domestic tourists permitted to re-enter Bali.\n\nAt present, international tourists would be welcome to visit Bali from 11 September.\n\n\u201cThe world is watching closely, and the success of Bali in reopening its tourism will greatly influence our efforts to resurrect Indonesian tourism,\u201d Tourism and Creative Economy Minister Wishnutama told Indonesian media.\n\nFixed deadlines, though, are tricky to manage in a fast-shifting, unpredictable pandemic. If Bali does open its borders next month, it is likely to be in a slow and gradual manner.\n\nLegal hurdles will need overcoming. Foreign tourists are currently prohibited from entering Indonesia, and international flights are restricted. Therefore, Bali will need the Jakarta government to amend its entry rules. It will also need to thrash out some \u2018green lane\u2019 agreements and approve more flights.\n\nBoth will prove tricky given the nation\u2019s COVID-19 struggles. Indonesia\u2019s President Joko Widodo is expected to make an announcement closer to Bali\u2019s presumed reopening date.\n\nWhy Reopen in September?\n\nThe timing is largely borne from economic necessity. Indonesia\u2019s economy contracted 5.3% in Q2. An under-pressure government needs to rejuvenate domestic consumption and generate much-needed currency inflows. It also badly needs a \u2018good news\u2019 story.\n\nThe holiday retreat of Bali is popular with Indonesian and inbound travellers, and being an island, the authorities believe they can control visitor numbers \u2013 and case infections.\n\nEven with a phased reopening and strict safety protocols, it represents a huge risk \u2013 both for Bali\u2019s reputation and its public health.\n\nBut Indonesia appears to be nearing an economic inflection point of no return.\n\nOrdinarily, Bali would be enjoying a busy period. Hotel occupancy statistics for 2019 show that August, September and October produced the year\u2019s highest averages, 67.1%, 63.2% and 63.3%, respectively.\n\nBy comparison, January 2020 registered a fairly healthy 59.3%, plummeting to 2.09% in May.\n\nThe Mega Markets: China & Australia\n\nIn a \u2018normal\u2019 year, the mid-September reopening would appeal to the vital Chinese market. The first week of October is one of two Golden Week public holidays, which witnesses a surge of outbound travel. With Chinese travellers becoming accustomed to short booking windows, this would give them time to plan their \u201crevenge spend\u201d Bali getaways.\n\nExcept, of course, that Chinese borders are firmly shut, and Bali banned direct flights from China at the start of February. Even in the absence of unchecked viral infections, remedial bilateral diplomatic work may be needed.\n\nMoreover, China only reintroduced inter-provincial domestic travel booking in mid-July and will reinstate tourism access to Macao from late September. Just in time for Golden Week.\n\nIs Beijing likely to sanction travel to Bali anytime soon? Perhaps not, but if it were to permit strictly controlled charter groups on a pilot basis, Bali would be an appealing destination.\n\nBali\u2019s other primary market appears a longer shot. In 2019, around 1.3 million Australians visited Bali. Large parts of the hotel, bar, restaurant and hotel infrastructure in places like Kuta were built with Australian tourists in mind. In addition, September to December were the four strongest months for Australian outbound travel in 2019.\n\nThe timing would be right. Except, Australia\u2019s Prime Minister has precluded outbound travel while the country fights winter COVID-19 community transmissions, particularly in Victoria.\n\nSecondary Markets?\n\nJapan and South Korea seem similarly unlikely to sanction travel to Bali. The northern hemisphere winter would usually bring visitors from long-haul markets like the UK, US, France and Germany, but each of those has a long virus battel ahead.\n\nThat leaves South East Asian nations, particularly Malaysia, and India as residual hopes. Neither appear likely to deliver in September, and perhaps not until early next year.\n\nIn early July, Indonesia\u2019s flag carrier Garuda floated the notion of direct flights to Bali from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Mumbai and New Delhi. This would obviate transiting in Jakarta, or another South East Asian airport. It would also enable morning arrivals and evening departures, thereby ensuring maximum spending time in Bali.\n\nBut, obtaining regulatory approval in a US election year would be a stunning achievement. And although Bali is a big draw for Indian travellers \u2013 and pent-up demand for travel clearly exists \u2013 September would appear to be too soon.\n\nSo, what is Bali\u2019s strategy to attract inbound travellers given that its key markets are either subject to travel bans, air capacity cuts, uncertain flight pricing and travel risk aversion?\n\nThe answer to that question is unknown. Despite leaked suggestions that Indonesia is seeking to negotiate limited access to Bali with Asian governments, nothing is confirmed.\n\nAll of which suggests a short-term stimulus may need to be found closer to home.\n\nCan Domestic Travel Step Up?\n\nThe importance of domestic travel to Bali is sometimes overlooked. In 2019, Bali\u2019s I Gusti Ngurah Rai Airport handled 24.17 million arriving and departing passengers. Of those, 6.86 million were international arrivals, with 4.97 million domestic arrivals.\n\nThe devil is in the detail, as always. While the difference between the figures is relatively low, international arrivals grew 12% compared to 2018, while domestic arrivals fell 10%.\n\nOn this basis, it seems unlikely that domestic tourism alone can resurrect Bali\u2019s economic fortunes. However, travel is re-setting, and Bali could prove to be an enticing destination for domestic travellers, especially those wary of flying beyond Indonesian borders.\n\nFor now, Bali is piecing together the hugely complex jigsaw that it set itself by announcing a reopening schedule. The date may move, it may stay the same \u2013 but Asia\u2019s COVID-era tourism politics will likely hold more influence on visitor numbers than new safety protocols, volcanic sand beaches and surf waves.\n\n\u2014\n\nGary Bowerman is Director of Check-in Asia, and an experienced Asia tourism analyst and media commentator.
