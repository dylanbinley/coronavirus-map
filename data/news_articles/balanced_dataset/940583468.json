STR/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe destruction of Beirut's port in a huge explosion last week has left Lebanon in a seemingly impossible position where it may run out of bread.\n\nAccording to a senior Lebanese official who spoke to Insider, the loss of the port, along with much of the nation's food stockpiles, has created a severe bottleneck.\n\nThe immediate effect of the Beirut explosion \u2014 caused when a stockpile of explosive fertilizer detonated on August 4 \u2014 was to kill some 200 people and injure thousands more.\n\nIt also wrecked the port, which is how 90% of Lebanon's goods typically enter the country. Lebanon imports almost everything consumed there, leaving domestic industries poorly-placed to cover the shortfall.\n\nThe port was also home to vast stockpiles of grain, and much of the nation's storage capacity, now lost as well.\n\nThe official who spoke to Insider works for the Ministry of the Economy, asked for anonymity given the political crisis currently roiling Lebanese politics. The country's whole government resigned earlier this week.\n\n\u00a9 Marwan Naamani/picture alliance via Getty Images A man carries away an injured person following a massive explosion in Beirut's port on August 4, 2020.

Reuters\n\nThe result, according to the Lebanese official, is an intense bottleneck at Lebanon's second port in the northern city of Tripoli.\n\n\"Trablus Port has about 20 percent of Beirut's capacity until now, this will need to be expanded,\" said the official, using the local name for Tripoli.\n\n\"Lebanon needs about 45,000 tons of grain each month for bread... But we also need immediate food and medical aid for the wounded and homeless, we need more engineering and construction equipment to help East Beirut, and we will need many tons of concrete and glass to repair the city.\"\n\nThe numbers supplied by the official are consistent with what international experts told the Reuters news agency last week.\n\n\"Lebanon does not have the capacity to import these things without Beirut's port.\"\n\n\u00a9 STR/AFP via Getty Images A picture shows a destroyed silo at the scene of an explosion at the port in the Lebanese capital Beirut on August 4, 2020.

If there is no bread, the people will be forced to violence. No electricity, no home, no bread? That's a revolution.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nVideo: Lebanon justice minister resigns over Beirut blast (Reuters)", "METADATA": {"civicscience": {"jspoll-hostname": "www138.civicscience.com"}, "application-name": "Lebanon is running out of food after the Beirut explosion wrecked its main port \u2014 leaving a bottleneck for supplies that may see the country go hungry", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "Money", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Losing the Beirut port in the August 4 blast also deprived Lebanon of the means by which 90% of its imports arrive in the country.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
