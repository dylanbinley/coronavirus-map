"12 new COVID cases in NSW", "TEXT": "Another 12 cases of coronavirus were diagnosed across the state up to 8pm on Wednesday, with three of those having no known source.\n\nFive cases were returned travellers in hotel quarantine, and four were locally acquired with a known source of infection.\n\nOne case linked to the Our Lady of Mercy College in Parramatta attended Westfield Liverpool on Friday August 7 from 10:30-11am and 12:30-1pm, and 5th Avenue Beauty Bar in Wetherill Park on August 8 from 2-3pm.\n\nAnyone who was at these venues at those times is considered a casual contact and advised to watch for symptoms and get tested if any arise.\n\nNew South Wales also recorded its 53rd death from coronavirus, a woman in her 80s whose infection was linked to the Our Lady of Lebanon cluster.\n\nShe is believed to have been in the intensive care unit of a Sydney hospital before she died.\n\nThis is the first death in nearly two weeks, with the last on August 1, and announced on August 2.\n\nCase numbers have continued to grow in the past few weeks, with 18 new cases announced on Tuesday, and a total of 135 active cases in the state.\n\nSix patients are in ICU and being ventilated.\n\nThere have been 380 cases of coronavirus throughout New South Wales with no identified source.\n\nThe national death toll for coronavirus stands at 361.\n\n12 new cases of #COVID19 have
