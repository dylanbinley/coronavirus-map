He specifically cited Trump\u2019s sanctions aimed at halting construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would link Russia and Germany.\n\n\u201cOur actions are aimed at curbing Russia\u2019s malign activity,\u201d according to an emailed statement from a State Department spokesperson. \u201cWe continue to work with our European partners to make it clear that Nord Stream 2 enables Russia to use its energy supplies as a political weapon in Europe and undermine Ukrainian security.\u201d\n\nRelations between the U.S. and the EU -- and Germany in particular -- have plumbed new lows, with Trump hitting his transatlantic allies with sweeping tariffs and pulling out of multilateral agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. Trump also announced plans to withdraw about 12,000 troops from Germany last month, saying Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government had been \u201cdelinquent\u201d on defense spending.\n\n\u2018Illegal\u2019 Sanctions\n\n\u201cThere was an informal outreach which the EU member states could join on a voluntary basis,\u201d EU Spokeswoman Nabila Massrali told reporters on Friday when asked about the complaint. She added that the U.S. threatening sanctions against European companies was \u201cpart of a wider, worrying trend.\u201d\n\nThe Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline has become a central point of tension between Merkel and Trump, who has blasted the project for sending \u201cbillions\u201d to Russia. Merkel has called new sanctions aimed at the gas route illegal. Still, there is no consensus among the EU on Nord Stream, with countries such as Poland condemning the pipeline for bypassing eastern Europe and increasing the bloc\u2019s reliance on Russian energy.\n\nLast week, three Republican Senators ratcheted up tensions with a letter warning that a German Baltic Sea port would face \u201ccrushing legal and economic\u201d sanctions if it continued to participate in the completion of the pipeline. Mukran Port, located in Merkel\u2019s constituency, is a supply base for the 1,200-kilometer (745-mile) undersea pipeline.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas this week said EU member states would discuss to what extent extraterritorial sanctions violate international law, as he renewed his condemnation of U.S. threats.\n\n\u201cNo state has the right to dictate Europe\u2019s energy policy with threats -- and it won\u2019t work,\u201d Maas told reporters Monday alongside Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during a daylong visit to Moscow.\n\nAll stakeholders of Nord Stream 2 still aim to complete the gas link, Lavrov said at the briefing. \u201cThere are reasons to assume that it will be done in the near future.\u201d\n\n(Updates with U.S. statement in the fourth paragraph)\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "METADATA": {"civicscience": {"jspoll-hostname": "www138.civicscience.com"}, "application-name": "EU Members Protest U.S. Sanctions After Nord Stream Threats", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "World News", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Twenty-four European Union countries complained to the U.S. State Department this week over President Donald Trump\u2019s expansive use of sanctions to help influence American foreign policy goals, according to a European diplomat familiar with the communication.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
