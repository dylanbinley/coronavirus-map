Online shopping, faster and more convenient deliveries, new click-and-collect options, and a contactless shopping experience have become the norm and are here to stay.\" Loading And Victorians are on board. New research from Monash University shows we are spending less time in stores, more time online and have signed up in droves to have someone else pack our groceries. The Australian Consumer and Retail Studies unit at Monash Business School found that a quarter of Victorians raced through stores in less than half an hour during July, doubling the number of speedy shoppers (12 per cent) since January. The monthly survey of 4641 Australian shoppers also found one in five Victorians bought food and groceries online more often in July in a bid to avoid stepping inside a store.\n\nThis was despite supermarkets, major retailers and many smaller stores still opening for business in July before stage four restrictions brought most in-store shopping to a shuddering halt. Loading Dr Eloise Zoppos, a principal consultant at Monash Business School, said the pandemic could forever change the way Victorians shopped. \"These findings suggest that Victorians are well placed to adjust to the 'new normal', with many having already turned online for their shopping needs prior to the new restrictions,\" she said. \"And with the likelihood that online shopping will continue to boom during this time, many retailers have been quick to adapt to the new restrictions.\"\n\nWhen florists Annette Duff and Fiona Bens were forced to close the doors of Irelands Florist of Sunbury, they erected a huge \"click and collect\" sign outside their store. It has paid off, with business booming. \"We updated our website and put more emphasis on what goes into the window display,\" Ms Duff said. The pair said customers were ordering flowers, chocolates, candles and balloons online and collecting them from the shop's front door, or taking advantage of delivery options. Major retailers have gone one step further, with Woolworths, Officeworks and Bunnings among those offering a \"drive and collect\" service, where customers order and pay for products online and staff members then pack orders directly into car boots. After a 50 per cent jump in demand for click-and-collect services in July, Woolworths this week opened up the \"drive through\" service to its 100th Victorian store.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "theme-color": "#0A1633", "title": "Click, collect: Pandemic accelerates changes to shopping habits", "description": "A boom in online shopping, local deliveries and click and collect services during the COVID-19 pandemic could permanently change the way Victorians shop.", "article": {"section": "Consumer affairs", "published_time": "2020-08-13T09:30:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T12:11:44+00:00"}, "pubdate": "2020-08-13T09:30:00+00:00", "author": "Hanna Mills Turbet", "fb": {"app_id": 230318243699378, "pages": 492499720777787}, "og": {"description": "A boom in online shopping, local deliveries and click and collect services during the COVID-19 pandemic could permanently change the way Victorians shop.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3993491674606415%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_650%2C$y_181/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_theage_no_age_social_wm/8f5c6a050930eec6c79c16e30f87c34202c81537", "width": 800, "height": 450, "secure_url": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3993491674606415%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_650%2C$y_181/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_theage_no_age_social_wm/8f5c6a050930eec6c79c16e30f87c34202c81537"}, "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Age", "title": "Click, collect: Pandemic accelerates changes to shopping habits", "url": "https://www.theage.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/click-collect-pandemic-accelerates-changes-to-shopping-habits-20200813-p55ld7.html"}, "parsely-title": "Click, collect: Pandemic accelerates changes to shopping habits", "parsely-link": "https://www.theage.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/click-collect-pandemic-accelerates-changes-to-shopping-habits-20200813-p55ld7.html", "parsely-type": "NewsArticle", "parsely-image-url": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3993491674606415%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_650%2C$y_181/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_theage_no_age_social_wm/8f5c6a050930eec6c79c16e30f87c34202c81537", "parsely-section": "Consumer affairs", "parsely-author": "Hanna Mills Turbet", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-08-13T09:30:00+00:00", "parsely-tags": "RETAIL,woolworths limited,melbourne", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"article\",\"assetId\":\"p55ld7\"}", "parsely-network-canonical": "https://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/click-collect-pandemic-accelerates-changes-to-shopping-habits-20200813-p55ld7.html", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,index", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A boom in online shopping, local deliveries and click and collect services during the COVID-19 pandemic could permanently change the way Victorians shop.", "image": {"src": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3993491674606415%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_650%2C$y_181/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_theage_no_age_social_wm/8f5c6a050930eec6c79c16e30f87c34202c81537"}, "site": "@theage", "title": "Click, collect: Pandemic accelerates changes to shopping habits"}, "google-signin-client_id": "589384154045-p5vk6p2adh6l4p13n8rfjtbsfqu8gbn5.apps.googleusercontent.com"}}}
