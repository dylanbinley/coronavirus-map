Iveson said the new material added a \u201cconsiderable amount\u201d of narrative background and collateral conduct to the earlier indictment against Assange. She said the US had served evidence far too late, after the defence had already served its entire case. The US government started assembling its case before December 2017. It delivered an opening note in July 2019 and opened its full case in detail on 24 February this year. \u201cWe strongly oppose them being given a third opportunity to open this case and expand it,\u201d said Iveson. \u201cOur position is that the new material could and should have been provided at a much earlier stage and the only just way forward is to exclude it.\u201d\n\nNormal for prosecutors to issue new charges Clair Dobbin, barrister representing the US government, said it was common practice for US prosecutors to continue investigating a defendant\u2019s criminal conduct even after he has been arrested and charged. \u201cThey continued to investigate Mr Assange\u2019s criminal conduct, including conduct that was not originally alleged,\u201d she said. \u201cWe respectfully disagree that it does not fundamentally alter the basis on which extradition is sought. \u201cUS prosecutors have added some further allegations that set out conduct that expands to some degree Mr Assange and WikiLeaks\u2019 alleged conduct in relation to other hackers. It extends the group of people \u2013 beyond Ms Manning \u2013 that Mr Assange is alleged to have conspired with.\u201d Dobbin added: \u201cIt does go beyond adding mere narrative background to the extradition request. The court doesn\u2019t have the power to dismiss aspects of the conducts alleged.\u201d\n\nSuperseding indictment based on publicly available material from 2010/11 Assange\u2019s lawyer, Iveson, said much of the new conduct in the superseding indictment was based on evidence of contemporaneous, publicly available material from 2010/11, including evidence on the WikiLeaks website available from 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see how this could be the fruit of an ongoing investigation,\u201d she said. District judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled: \u201cWhatever the reasons for this new request, this resumed final hearing is only a few weeks away and the part two request was served the day before yesterday and Mr Assange has not even been arrested for that request. This will take place on the first day of the resumed hearing. \u201cThe defence submits that fairness can be achieved by the court refusing to allow the government to rely on new evidence. \u201cWhether the new evidence is mere narrative background cannot be decided without seeing the conduct as a whole and how it relates to the equivalent offences. \u201cThis court has no jurisdiction to reject the request.\u201d The judge added: \u201cMs Iveson argues that it was brought about in bad faith and is an abuse of the court process. \u201cA number of issues regarding the abuse of process have been raised by the defence and any suggestion that this too constitutes abuse will have to be dealt with when all the other abuse questions are dealt with. \u201cI offer the defence more time, knowing that the consequences of delay are extremely unattractive.\u201d Iveson said: \u201cWe will need further time to consider that and our wider legal response to that request.\u201d\n\nAssange\u2019s psychiatric condition may have declined Dobbin told the court that a psychiatric report received by the defence showed that Assange\u2019s condition may have declined over the last few weeks. \u201cObviously the US may wish to take that into consideration,\u201d she said. The judge said that, in principle, the extradition hearing could use live-streaming video for specific individuals outside the jurisdiction who cannot come to court because of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cIn principle, there is no objection to the use of the cloud video platform, but there are limited licences to use that platform and it is not generally something the court is involved in,\u201d she said. \u201cApplications must be made to the Old Bailey.\u201d Addressing the defendant, she added: \u201cMr Assange, if the defence do not apply for more time or to vacate the hearing, the resumed hearing will begin on 7 September this year. This will be the last administrative-type hearing of this kind and you will be physically produced on that date at 10am. Until then, you remain in custody for the reasons I\u2019ve given you before. Do you understand what I\u2019ve said today?\u201d Assange replied slowly: \u201cI have heard most of your words.\u201d\n\nAssange unable to consult with lawyers Responding to a request from his legal team to talk with their client, the judge asked the defendant: \u201cDo you still have a jailer in the room with you, Mr Assange? Is it possible to arrange a post-court conference today?\u201d The prison guard responded: \u201cUnfortunately not, because you\u2019ve overrun by 35 minutes. It would impact on other cases due to lunch breaks.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Lawyer for WikiLeaks founder slams US decision to serve a second indictment at the 11th hour alleging that Assange conspired with hackers, as a potential abuse of process.", "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Julian Assange, Extradtion, superseding indictment, hacking", "publicationDate": "08/14/2020", "og": {"title": "US decision to file new charges against Julian Assange \u2018astonishing and potentially abusive\u2019", "site_name": "ComputerWeekly.com", "url": "https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252487666/US-decision-to-file-new-charges-against-Julian-Assange-astonishing-and-potentially-abusive-court", "description": "Lawyer for WikiLeaks founder slams US decision to serve a second indictment at the 11th hour alleging that Assange conspired with hackers, as a potential abuse of process.", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB", "image": "https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/visuals/ComputerWeekly/Hero Images/Westminster-Magistrates-Court-hero-by-Niels-Ladefoged.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1528871824046027}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/computerweekly"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@computerweekly", "title": "US decision to file new charges against Julian Assange \u2018astonishing...", "description": "Lawyer for WikiLeaks founder slams US decision to serve a second indictment at the 11th hour alleging that Assange conspired with hackers, as a potential abuse of process.", "image": "https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/visuals/ComputerWeekly/Hero Images/Westminster-Magistrates-Court-hero-by-Niels-Ladefoged.jpg"}}}}
