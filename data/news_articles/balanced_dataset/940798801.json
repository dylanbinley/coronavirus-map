US President Donald Trump, who apparently helped broker the deal, has attempted to paint it as a big breakthrough.\n\nBut the Palestinians have utterly rejected the deal.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas referred to the deal as an \u201caggression\u201d against the Palestinian people and a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of their cause. The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas described it as \u201ca stab in the back of the Palestinian cause.\u201d And Palestinian people staged protests against the deal in the occupied West Bank and the besieged Gaza Strip on Friday.\n\nThe Emirates is now the third Arab country, after Egypt and Jordan, to normalize with Israel. Abu Dhabi was already believed to have clandestine relations with Tel Aviv.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "og": {"site_name": "PressTV", "title": "Yemen\u2019s Ansarullah slams UAE-Israel deal as \u2018great betrayal\u2019 of Palestinians", "type": "video", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Yemen\u2019s Houthi Ansarullah movement decries the deal reached between the United Arab Emirates and Israel to fully normalize relations as a \u201cgreat betrayal\u201d of the Palestinian cause.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.presstv.com/Photo/2020/8/14/67d1c73c-8545-4e1c-842b-0df17acef5a3.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn.presstv.com/Photo/2020/8/14/67d1c73c-8545-4e1c-842b-0df17acef5a3.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 360, "type": "image/jpg"}}, "title": "Yemen\u2019s Ansarullah slams UAE-Israel deal as \u2018great betrayal\u2019 of Palestinians", "description": "Press TV is an Iranian state-controlled news and documentary network that broadcasts in the English and French-language.
