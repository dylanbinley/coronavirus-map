So if we gave Nana Akufo-Addo and the NPP 88% of total votes in 2016 here in Bantama, I believe it is fair to say that he deserves 95% of votes in 2020 for fulfilling all those promises made to us in 2016\u201d, he said to a rousing applause.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe importance of good roads extends to all aspects of development of our communities as it contributes to the provision of jobs, access to healthcare and education services, among others. Had the NPP won in 2008, this road would have been long completed but it was neglected by the previous NDC administration. Today, we all bear witness to the visionary leadership of the President Akufo-Addo that has led the implementation of Free SHS policy, Planting for Food and Jobs, One District, One Factory; and the setting up of a vehicle assembling plant by automobile giant VW in Ghana, among others,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nOn his part, Minister for Roads and Highways, Kwasi Amoako Atta who was special guest of honour at the ceremony said, \u201cthe development of the entire Ashanti region, especially Kumasi and its environs, is very dear to the heart of President Akufo-Addo and his government. Today\u2019s ceremony shows the commitment of the Government to improving the condition of all road network in Kumasi and the country at large.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Minister also revealed that several road networks are currently undergoing construction in all 275 constituencies in Ghana. \u201cOut of the total 80,000km road networks in the country, only 23% had seen some construction when the NPP took office in January 2017. However, I can boldly say that there are ongoing road constructions in all 260 district assemblies in the country\u201d, he disclosed.\n\n\n\nThe Mayor of Kumasi, Osei Assibey Antwi called on all residents of Kumasi to support the government in order to bring more development to the area.\n\n\n\nThe sitting Member of Parliament for the area, Daniel Okyem Aboagye who was there to support the activity called on all of his supporters to rally behind the new parliamentary candidate of the party to ensure victory in the forthcoming general elections.\n\nDisclaimer GhanaWeb is not responsible for the reportage or opinions of contributors published on the website.
