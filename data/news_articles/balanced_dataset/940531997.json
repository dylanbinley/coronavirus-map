Picture: Don Emmert/AFP\n\nRichard Branson had drawn criticism for calling on governments \u2013 both in the UK and Australia \u2013 to help his airlines survive the pandemic.\n\nIn April, the billionaire wrote a lengthy open letter warning Australia faced a Qantas monopoly if Virgin Australia, which was 10 per cent owned by the Virgin Group, disappeared.\n\nIn a development unrelated to Virgin Atlantic\u2019s woes, Virgin Australia announced today it would shed 3000 jobs and axe its low-cost subsidiary Tigerair Australia as it planned to re-emerge \u201cstronger, more profitable and competitive\u201d from voluntary administration.\n\nThe jobs will be cut across cabin crew, ground crew, engineers, baggage handlers and some international head office staff.\n\nmedia_camera Virgin Australia will let go of 3000 workers as it emerges from voluntary administration. Picture: Tertius Pickard/NCA NewsWire\n\nVirgin Australia chief executive Paul Scurrah said the airline would focus on domestic and short-haul international flights, although those overseas destinations have not been confirmed.\n\n\u201cDemand for domestic and short-haul international travel is likely to take at least three years to return to pre-COVID-19 levels, with the real chance it could be longer, which means as a business we must make changes to ensure the Virgin Australia Group is successful in this new world,\u201d Mr Scurrah said.\n\n\u201cOur initial focus will be on investing in the core Virgin Australia domestic and short-haul international operation alongside our 10-million-member strong Velocity Frequent Flyer program, continuing to offer an extensive network of destinations, a domestic lounge network and value for money for customers.\u201d\n\nOriginally published as Virgin Atlantic files for bankruptcy", "METADATA": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "referrer": "origin", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.ntnews.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/ntnews/ms-icon-70x70.png", "msapplication-square144x144logo": "https://www.ntnews.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/ntnews/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.ntnews.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/ntnews/ms-icon-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.ntnews.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/ntnews/ms-icon-310x310.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.ntnews.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/ntnews/ms-icon-144x144.png", "robots": "noarchive", "description": "As Virgin Australia announces massive job cuts, Richard Bransons cash-strapped Virgin Atlantic has filed for bankruptcy in the US.", "keywords": "voluntary administration, coronavirus pandemic, chief executive, international head office, global health crisis, health crisis passes, private rescue plan, coronavirus updates, domestic lounge network, bondholder contracts, bankruptcy protection, head office staff, massive job cuts, rescue package, rescue funds, cabin crew, baggage handlers, passenger operations, long-haul routes, low-cost subsidiary, global pandemic, short-haul international travel, New York, United States of America, Northern America, North America, America, Australia, Australia and New Zealand, Oceania, London, United Kingdom, Northern Europe, Europe, Heathrow Airport Ltd., Virgin Group Inc., Virgin Atlantic Airways Inc., Bloomberg LP, Agence France Presse, Reuters AG, Sir Richard Branson", "generator": "tcog", "articleid": "fe06f29d63b004b8b3902d6aee79b0f3", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-05T09:21:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2020-08-05T09:21:07.000Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TheNTNews", "title": "Virgin Atlantic files for bankruptcy", "description": "Virgin Atlantic has filed for bankruptcy in the United States as it claims it will run out of cash next month without a rescue deal.", "image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a1a28b4995526de7485623e9fd7236bb"}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Virgin Atlantic files for bankruptcy", "description": "Virgin Atlantic has filed for bankruptcy in the United States as it claims it will run out of cash next month without a rescue deal.", "url": "https://www.ntnews.com.au/news/virgin-atlantic-files-for-bankruptcy-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/news-story/fe06f29d63b004b8b3902d6aee79b0f3", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a1a28b4995526de7485623e9fd7236bb", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "vr": {"canonical": "https://www.ntnews.com.au/news/virgin-atlantic-files-for-bankruptcy-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/news-story/fe06f29d63b004b8b3902d6aee79b0f3"}}}}
