Jaishankar during a meeting with his Maldivian counterpart Abdulla Shahid on Thursday.\n\nWhile the Maldivian government highlighted the $250 million financial package, the Indian side gave top billing to the investment in GMCP.\n\nThe Maldives China Friendship project, a 1.39-kilometre bridge linking the capital city Mal\u00e9 to Hulhule island, was opened in April 2018. Then Maldives president Abdulla Yameen, whose term witnessed strained ties with India and stronger alignment with China, had described the $200 million project as the \u201cbiggest achievement in our diplomatic history\u201d.\n\nAfter the opposition MDP candidate Ibrahim Solih defeated Yameen, India has been trying to leverage its friendlier disposition to expand its presence in the strategically located Indian Ocean archipelago.\n\n\u2018Largest civilian infrastructure project\u2019\n\nAnnouncing the decision to support the GMCP, Jaishankar noted, according to a Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) press release, that it will be the \u201clargest civilian infrastructure project in the Maldives\u201d. The financial package will have a grant component of $100 million and a new Line of Credit of $400 million.\n\nAn electoral promise of President Solih, the project will connect Mal\u00e9 with three neighbouring islands through a bridge and causeway link that will be 6.7 kilometres long. \u201cOnce completed, this landmark project will streamline connectivity between the four islands, thereby boosting economic activity, generating employment and promoting holistic urban development in the Mal\u00e9 region,\u201d said the Indian foreign ministry.\n\nIt is said that the Maldivian president had reportedly sought India\u2019s aid for the project during Jaishankar\u2019s visit to the country in September 2019.\n\nAccording to government sources, the \u201chigh visibility\u201d GMCP will render the Maldives China Friendship bridge \u2018insignificant in comparison\u2019. \u201cIt will help in demonstrating India\u2019s overarching presence in the Maldives through a high-visibility project in the Greater Mal\u00e9 region and showcase India\u2019s expertise in conceptualising and implementing a complex infrastructural project of this scale,\u201d they said.\n\nIndia had previously extended an $800 million line of credit, which is being used to implement seven projects ranging from a water supply and sewerage system to a port project.\n\nExtension of financial assistance\n\nFor the Maldives, the key assurance received during the meeting was the extension of financial assistance.\n\nThe Maldives foreign ministry headlined the readout of the video conference \u2013 \u201cextends financial support of 250 million US Dollars to the Maldives\u201d. The Indian press release stated that the \u201cexact modalities of the loan arrangement are being finalised by the two sides\u201d.\n\n\u201cGiven the financial challenges faced by the Maldives due to the COVID-19 situation and India\u2019s commitment to assist the Maldives in its economic recovery, EAM announced that the Government of India has decided to extend in-principle urgent financial assistance to the Government of Maldives, by way of a soft loan arrangement,\u201d said the MEA press note.\n\nIndian sources pointed out that India had earlier signed a $400 million bilateral currency swap agreement with the Maldives, out of which $150 million had already been withdrawn.\n\n\u201cThe Government of Maldives can draw the remaining $250 million anytime till July 2021 to increase forex liquidity and exchange rate management. On the GoM\u2019s request, the currency swap agreement has been further extended for a period of one year,\u201d the sources said.\n\nTourism and travel\n\nThe restrictions on travel and lockdown have badly impacted the Maldives due to its dependence on tourism, with the government projecting a GDP contraction of 11% this year.\n\nLast month, the Maldives opened its international airport to foreign tourists after a gap of nearly three months.\n\nJaishankar announced that India will create an air travel bubble with the country, with the first flight expected to commence on August 18. Until now, India has largely negotiated air travel bubbles with western countries, so this is the first in the neighbourhood.\n\n\u201cHe (the Maldivian foreign minister) emphasised the importance of easing travel, especially for Maldivians seeking to visit India for urgently required medical treatment, as well as Indian tourists wishing to visit the Maldives,\u201d said the Maldivian statement.\n\nBesides, India and Maldives agreed that a direct cargo ferry service, announced during the Indian PM\u2019s visit last year, will \u201ccommence shortly\u201d.\n\n\u201cA direct cargo ferry service presents an opportunity for India to replace other countries and become the top trade partner of Maldives. In this context and with many bilateral projects slated to commence in the next few months, it is the right time to start a cargo ferry service with the Maldives,\u201d explained government sources.\n\nIndia has also offered a larger annual quota for this year of supply of essential commodities as defined by the 1981 bilateral trade agreement.\n\nThe MEA also added that President Solih is likely to visit India this year \u201csubject to the COVID-19 related conditions\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "During a meeting between foreign ministers S.
