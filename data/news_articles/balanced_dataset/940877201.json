In 2017, working under then-City Attorney Bronson Potter, she sued Vancouver over gender-based harassment, discrimination, retaliation and a hostile work environment. The suit named Potter, as well as City Manager Eric Holmes and Assistant City Attorney Jonathan Young (Young has since been promoted to city attorney, following Potter\u2019s retirement last year).\n\nThe two lawsuits are connected \u2014 the June 2019 records request that launched the latest suit was inquiring about \u201cattorney fee bills for attorneys hired to represent the City in any employment law related claims, litigation lawsuits.\u201d Quinn also sought information about who was handling the city\u2019s employment law cases.\n\nThe suit claims that \u201cthe City silently withheld entire records,\u201d \u201cwithout claiming those records were exempt from disclosure or listing them on an exemption log.\u201d According to the document, the city failed to produce documentation on all of the legal expenses incurred fighting Quinn\u2019s 2017 suit.\n\nQuinn is seeking disclosure of the records, as well as an award of \u201creasonable costs, attorney fees and penalties.\u201d\n\nShe did not respond to The Columbian\u2019s request for comment Friday afternoon. Vancouver\u2019s Human Resources department confirmed that Quinn is no longer employed with the city attorney\u2019s office.\n\nAnd as for her original discrimination suit, it\u2019s yet to be resolved. In April 2019, the city filed a motion to dismiss the case, citing insufficient evidence and hearsay in Quinn\u2019s testimony. The court ruled against the city\u2019s motion to dismiss in August 2019 \u2014 in the ruling, District Judge Benjamin Settle wrote that \u201cQuinn has sufficiently shown questions of fact exists\u201d as to whether she\u2019d been subject to discrimination.\n\nThe Columbian reported Quinn\u2019s original suit at the time. Quinn claimed that Potter had \u201cdeliberately and intentionally created a hostile work environment against women, minorities and women over 40.\u201d She cites a reported 2013 incident, in which Potter allegedly made comments about another female staffer\u2019s breast size. The suit also claims Potter made jokes about including a wig in the termination agreement of an employee who had cancer. Quinn was later passed by for a promotion and placed on administrative leave, which she claims were retaliatory measures.\n\nA trial is scheduled to begin on June 8, 2021.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Former Vancouver staffer files another suit against the city - All Politics is Local", "description": "A former assistant city attorney filed a lawsuit against her past employer this week over its handling of public records.
