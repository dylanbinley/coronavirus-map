Later the same day, Professor Tokpa received a text from Dr. Fallah with a \u201cPOSITIVE\u201d result followed by a telephone call with the same \u201cPOSITIVE\u201d result from Dr. Wapoe, the Montserrado County Health Officer, explained Dr. Nyan to the journalist group, Local Voices-Around the Country.\n\nLike many other instances of wrong diagnosis of patients, established cases initially brought to the attention of the NPHIL about five months ago were that of the 42-year patient who died in April at the Jackson Fiah Doe Memorial Hospital Tappita as well as the 72-year-old John Teah who died at the Eternal Love Winning Africa (ELWA) Hospital of complications with hypertension, but was wrongly diagnosed of COVID-19 infection. These bodies were tested several days postmortem and were given inaccurate test results,\u201d Dr. Nyan added.\n\nAsked about the accuracy of testing done in Liberia, the infectious disease expert, Dr. Dougbeh Chris Nyan, expressed concerns about the \u201cquality of Coronavirus-2 testing kits which were sent to Liberia and other African countries by philanthropic donors.\u201d\n\nDr. Nyan said that, \u201cthere has been mixed up of patients names and data, inaccurate reporting and unprofessional laboratory practices at the National Reference Lab, the only one in the county serving a population of about 4.5 million people.\u201d\n\nAccording a communication in our passion dated February 28, 2020, Dr. Nyan wrote the Ministry of Health and the NPHIL and volunteered his services to develop Liberia\u2019s COVID-19 testing kits, train laboratory personnel to run the COVID-19 test and set up additional sub-reference labs in the North, Central, and South-Eastern Regions of the country as was done in Rwanda. \u201cThis would have helped the country with accurate COVID-19 diagnostic and increase its capability, but the government of Liberia did not respond to my free offer,\u201d he said.\n\nThere has been a fall-out at the National Public Health Institute lately regarding wrong testing results that led to the withholding of the passport of Ms. Wilson, a Liberian-American who was released from quarantine and due to travel to the United States.\n\nQuizzed about any suggestions to the Liberian government, Dr. Nyan restated his proposal for an \u201cindependent scientific panel to review the testing procedure and results, purchased accurate COVID-19 testing kits, provide protective gears and incentives for healthcare workers, and get qualified and experienced professionals to run the Incidence Management System so as to curb the COVID-19 pandemic in Liberia.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, asked whether a COVID-19 vaccine would be ready anytime soon, Dr. Nyan said \u201cthere are several COVID-19 vaccine candidates in late trial (stage 3); we will not have a vaccine anytime soon, but expect an FDA-approved vaccine probably 6 to 12 months from now.\u201d\n\nDr. Nyan is winner of the 2017 African Innovation Prize for Social Impact and also awarded a Patent by the United States Patent and Trademark Office for his invention of the rapid multiplex pathogens diagnostic test, which can simultaneously detect and identify multiple infections, including Coronaviruses (COVID-19). He has been providing COVID-19 pandemic preparedness advice to the Liberian government and awareness in Africa and laboratory diagnostic training webinar to West African laboratory personnel.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Liberia\u2019s COVID-19 Testing Inaccurate, Says Liberian Scientists Dougbeh Chris Nyan - FrontPageAfrica", "description": "WASHINGTON, DC \u2013 A prominent infectious disease scientist, Dr. Dougbeh Chris Nyan has said that Liberia\u2019s testing \u201cregime for COVID-19 is completely inaccurate and there needs to be an investigation into the wrong testing results repeatedly produce by the National Public Health Reference Lab for patients or people tested for SARS-CoV-2 which causes the COVID-19 [\u2026]", "url": "https://frontpageafricaonline.com/news/liberias-covid-19-testing-inaccurate-says-liberian-scientists-dougbeh-chris-nyan/", "site_name": "FrontPageAfrica", "image": {"identifier": "https://frontpageafricaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dr.-Dougbeh-Chris-Nyan-M.D.-speaking-at-the-Johns-Hopkins-University-Photo-Janice-Allotey.png", "width": 974, "height": 729}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T01:37:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T01:37:20+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 5.4.6.3 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface.", "fb": {"app_id": "FrontPage-Africa-180277731992421"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://frontpageafricaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cropped-favicon-270x270.png", "numberOfItems": 3, "itemListOrder": "Ascending"}}}
