In addition, banks are demanding more collateral, without extending the moratorium or the cycle time to repay loans,\u201d another Tata Motors dealer said on condition of anonymity.A slow market and heavy discounts to maintain market share are also hurting dealers.\u201cThis has resulted in huge losses and bankers have become very reluctant to continue their financing facilities after seeing our balance sheets,\u201d a third dealer said.Some of the dealers have over-leveraged themselves with excess manpower and infrastructure costs during good times, said T.T. Srinivasaraghavan, managing director of Sundaram Finance, a key financier for the trucking industry.\u201cEvery dealer\u2019s inherent strength is different, and by rescheduling loans, they will be able to rebuild the business,\u201d he said.Tata Motors sold 14,571 passenger vehicles in the first quarter, 61% lower than the corresponding period last year.The company reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 8,443.98 crore in the quarter, compared to a net loss of Rs 3,679.66 crore in the same period last year.It was, however, ranked third among passenger vehicle makers in India with a market share of 9.5% in the quarter.", "METADATA": {"description": "They urged Tata Motors to announce interest-free loans of Rs 25 crore for commercial vehicle dealerships and 10 crore for a passenger car dealership, adding that the company could recover the money over three to five years.", "news_keywords": "Tata Motors,During-market,company,slowdown,sales,Vehicle", "keywords": "Tata Motors,During-market,company,slowdown,sales,Vehicle", "article": {"tag": "sales"}, "fb": {"pages": 400601983320296, "app_id": 117787264903013, "admins": 556964827}, "og": {"title": "Tata Motors\u2019 dealers reach out for support", "description": "They urged Tata Motors to announce interest-free loans of Rs 25 crore for commercial vehicle dealerships and 10 crore for a passenger car dealership, adding that the company could recover the money over three to five years.", "site_name": "The Economic Times", "type": "website", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tata-motors-dealers-reach-out-for-support/articleshow/77516046.cms", "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-77516027,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-164986,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg"}, "website": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/", "object_type": "website", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@EconomicTimes", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tata-motors-dealers-reach-out-for-support/articleshow/77516046.cms", "title": "Tata Motors\u2019 dealers reach out for support", "description": "They urged Tata Motors to announce interest-free loans of Rs 25 crore for commercial vehicle dealerships and 10 crore for a passenger car dealership, adding that the company could recover the money over three to five years.", "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-77516027,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-164986,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg", "app": {"country": "IN", "name": {"iphone": "The Economic Times App", "googleplay": "The Economic Times App"}, "id": {"iphone": 474766725, "googleplay": "com.et.reader.activities"}, "url": {"iphone": "etapp://articleshow/77516046", "googleplay": "etandroidapp://articleshow/77516046"}}}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "al": {"ios": {"url": "etapp://articleshow/77516046", "app_store_id": 474766725, "app_name": "The Economic Times App"}, "android": {"url": "etandroidapp://articleshow/77516046", "com": "com.et.reader.activities", "app_name": "The Economic Times"}}}}}
