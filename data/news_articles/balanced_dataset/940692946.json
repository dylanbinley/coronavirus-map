Many film personalities including Parineeti Chopra, Varun Dhawan, Kriti Sanon joined the campaign seeking a CBI probe into the matter.\n\n\"It has been 2 months you left us Bhai and we are still fighting to know the truth, to know what actually happened that day. I request you all to please join us for Global 24-hour spiritual and prayer observation for Sushant Singh Rajput, so that the truth prevails and we find justice for our beloved Sushant,\" Kirti wrote on her social media accounts.\n\nOn Thursday, the late actor's father accused his rumoured girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty of thwarting the attempt to communicate with his son. \"During the lifetime of Sushant Singh Rajput, the father's attempt to talk to him on the telephone from Patna was thwarted by the accused persons by not letting him talk to him, which could have saved his son's life,\" Rajput's father KK Singh said in a written submission before the top court.\n\nCase transferred to CBI last week\n\nRajput was found dead at his residence in Bandra on June 14. Earlier this month, the centre accepted Bihar government's plea to transfer the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). On Wednesday, while hearing a plea filed by Chakraborty, seeking a transfer of the case to Mumbai, the Bihar government said that Bihar Police's probe into the matter is legitimate.\n\nDays after his death, Chakraborty had claimed she was Sushant Singh Rajput's \"girlfriend\" and requested a CBI inquiry into the case. The family members of the late actor have accused Chakraborty of abetting his alleged suicide. CBI has already filed a charge sheet against Chakraborty and her family members.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/sushant-singh-rajputs-sister-calls-for-global-24-hour-prayer-observation-for-justice-in-his-death-probe/636797", "type": "Article", "title": "Sushant Singh Rajput's sister calls for 'global 24-hour prayer observation' for justice in his death probe", "description": "The campaign seeking justice for late actor Sushant Singh Rajput was joined by actors Parineeti Chopra, Kriti Sanon and Varun Dhawan.", "image": "https://imgk.timesnownews.com/story/SushantSinghRajput-ians_1_6.jpg?tr=w-560,h-292,fo-top"}, "description": "The campaign seeking justice for late actor Sushant Singh Rajput was joined by actors Parineeti Chopra, Kriti Sanon and Varun Dhawan.", "news_keywords": "Sushant Singh Rajput, Sushant Singh Rajput case, Sushant Singh Rajput case probe, Sushant Singh Rajput case, Sushant singh Rajput latest, Varun Dhawan, Kriti Sanon, Parineeti Chopra", "keywords": "Sushant Singh Rajput, Sushant Singh Rajput case, Sushant Singh Rajput case probe, Sushant Singh Rajput case, Sushant singh Rajput latest, Varun Dhawan, Kriti Sanon, Parineeti Chopra", "fb": {"app_id": 2051731518430427, "pages": 218735715310}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sushant Singh Rajput's sister calls for 'global 24-hour prayer observation' for justice in his death probe", "description": "The campaign seeking justice for late actor Sushant Singh Rajput was joined by actors Parineeti Chopra, Kriti Sanon and Varun Dhawan.", "image": "https://imgk.timesnownews.com/story/SushantSinghRajput-ians_1_6.jpg", "site": "@TIMESNOW", "creator": "@TIMESNOW"}, "theme-color": "#254A96", "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
