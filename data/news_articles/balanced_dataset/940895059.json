faith\n\nInvestor sentiment has improved after the government eased lockdown measures, with IPO filings to list on the Thai bourse remaining at a normal proportion, says the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe securities watchdog reported its findings to recently appointed Finance Minister Predee Daochai after a meeting yesterday at the Bank of Thailand.\n\nApart from improved investor sentiment, IPO filings to list on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) suggest signs of strong confidence because decisions to launch IPOs remain unchanged, said Ruenvadee Suwanmongkol, SEC's secretary-general.\n\nThe number of IPO filings is expected to reach 30-35 this year, considered typical, Ms Ruenvadee said.\n\nMore than 30 securities have submitted IPO filings to the SEC, but most have yet to specify an IPO period and first trading day.\n\nThere have been five IPOs this year, with two listing on the SET and three on the Market for Alternative Investment.\n\nCombined market capitalisation at the IPO price was 303.9 billion baht as of Thursday.\n\nThe SEC chief's comments on improved investor sentiment contrasted with results from a recent survey of the Federation of Thai Capital Market Organisations (Fetco).\n\nThe investor confidence index for the three months to October fell 16% to 85.3 from June's 101.2, according to the monthly poll by Fetco.\n\nAn index below 80 points is considered bearish, 80-119 is neutral and over 119 is bullish.\n\nNegative factors lowering investor confidence include the domestic political situation and the economic slowdown, as well as SET-listed companies' lower earnings, said Paiboon Nalinthrangkurn, Fetco's chairman.\n\nMs Ruenvadee said the SEC will adjust its strategy for this year to align with operations in the post-pandemic period.\n\nThe capital market regulator acknowledges some difficulty in meeting its targets amid the outbreak, so plans will have to be revised in accordance with a changing economic landscape and innovative technologies.\n\nThe SEC is still committed to digitising the Thai capital market, such as by providing a greater opportunity for local firms to raise capital through crowdfunding and by setting up a trading board for small and medium-sized enterprises, Ms Ruenvadee said.\n\n\"We need to help build up confidence for the growth of the economy and move the country forward,\" she said.",
