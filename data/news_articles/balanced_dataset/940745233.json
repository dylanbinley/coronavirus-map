(9News)\n\nMr Wass's message to Queensland lawmakers is: \"I'd like any of those politicians to give it a go.\"\n\nUnder the current health directive, Queenslanders who are returning from NSW are no longer allowed to cross the border via road.\n\nInstead they must catch a plane and then quarantine in a hotel \u2013 all at their own expense.\n\nFor Mr Wass, who is struggling financially and says he has $10 to his name, the cost of the flight alone is not an option.\n\nRefused entry to the state and with no money for a hotel, Mr Wass has been sleeping under tree on the NSW side of the border.\n\nMr Wass only has a doona and pillow donated by a charity. (9News)\n\n\"Basic human rights is the right to have shelter and food and clothing, I've got all that but it's just over there, about a hundred kilometres, under an hour away and they won't let me,\" he said.\n\nA Queensland Health spokesperson refused to comment on Mr Wass's case specifically.\n\n\"Queensland's health and economy can't afford a second wave,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Individuals may be eligible for a hotel quarantine fee waiver under the grounds of financial hardship.\"\n\nBut there is no financial assistance to help with the cost of the flight into Queensland, even though Mr Wass's car is parked several hundred metres outside state lines.\n\n\"The only answer I get from any government department is we're very sorry, there's no box I fit in, so see you later - we can't do anything else,\" he said.", "METADATA": {"application-name": "Breaking Australian and World News Headlines - 9News", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "google-site-verification": "bZSv8nb8IaRbR_yiMCiQ-qBdfxfgPUl2IiWSZbcaiMo", "og": {"type": "website", "title": "Dad left sleeping rough after being caught on wrong side of the border", "description": "", "url": "https://www.9news.com.au/national/coronavirus-gold-coast-dad-left-sleeping-rough-after-being-caught-on-wrong-side-of-the-nswqueensland-border/d326e2d4-5193-4ddd-849a-fc72a1172ad1", "image": "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/lWfh61eARNJKrvyz1WLLDG6ZlPU=/1200x628/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F4e0c3afb-dd47-4692-98b1-b9dfde5adefc"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1327649940684033, "pages": 107637365950776}, "msvalidate.01": "635815AB3DF5AFBB454201A435112761", "nine": {"video-player": {"account": 664969388001, "player": "H190EXsjW", "token": "BCpkADawqM3qXkxa2gCNW1YSZX1O2fnRXM119G-54_ztltcSiWsvgyJY9CtOOv3ZvfuGrpEb5uAIgTbDeRGzPCUxD7wSPF2PTbyUP94iNaVM3PMR5xfIIDwmABqqXW0MEurYHpNPw_EATUf_", "video-params": {"ad-unit": "9news/web", "video-name-prefix": "news|", "page-name": "news:news:national:article-Coronavirus: Gold Coast dad left sleeping rough after being caught on wrong side of the NSW-Queensland border"}, "nielsen-plugin": "{\"sfcode\":\"dcr\",\"apid\":\"PFC7A06D1-31DD-4749-87F8-8FFD52371467\",\"enabled\":true,\"nol_sdkDebug\":\"console\",\"apn\":\"nineNews\",\"section\":\"nine.com.au - 9News\",\"segA\":\"\",\"segB\":\"Nine.com.au - 9News.com.au\",\"nsdkv\":511,\"defaults\":{\"hasAds\":1,\"program\":\"9News Videos\"}}", "granularTracking": {"pageTemplate": "article"}}}, "ninemsn": {"id": "d326e2d4-5193-4ddd-849a-fc72a1172ad1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@9News", "title": "Dad left sleeping rough after being caught on wrong side of the border", "description": "", "image": "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/lWfh61eARNJKrvyz1WLLDG6ZlPU=/1200x628/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F4e0c3afb-dd47-4692-98b1-b9dfde5adefc"}, "description": "When the Queensland border closed to New South Wales last weekend, Gold Coast father Clinton Wass found him...", "position": 1}}}
