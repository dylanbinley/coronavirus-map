REUTERS/Raneen Sawafta\n\nThe mixed response highlighted new fault lines in a region where fear and distrust of Iran - shared by Israel and some Arab states - has challenged a decades-old allegiance to the Palestinian issue as a major driver of Arab policy.\n\nPalestinians, who want to establish a state on West Bank territory captured by Israel in 1967, denounced the agreement as a betrayal of the long-held Arab stance that peace should be conditional on Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory.\n\nThe agreement, which is set to make the UAE only the third Arab state after Egypt and Jordan to make peace with Israel, calls for a temporary suspension of Israel\u2019s planned annexation of occupied West Bank territory, but not withdrawal.\n\nThe deal, which U.S. President Donald Trump helped to broker with support from senior adviser Jared Kushner, forms a new axis with the UAE aligning itself with Israel in confronting Shi\u2019ite Muslim Iran and Sunni Islamist radicals in the region.\n\nThis is likely to heighten tensions in the Gulf, which has in the past two years seen attacks on tankers and energy assets that the United States and Saudi Arabia have blamed on Iran, a charge Tehran denies.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign minister said the deal aimed to hand Trump a win ahead of U.S. elections in November, a view echoed by the leader of Lebanon\u2019s Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shameful what Abu Dhabi did ... They don\u2019t see the Zionist regime as an enemy, but an ally and what\u2019s happening now is to help Trump in the elections,\u201d Iran\u2019s Mohammad Javad Zarif told Al Mayadeen TV.\n\nHezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, in a televised speech, described the UAE move as an \u201celection favour\u201d for both Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and said more Arab states would follow suit to \u201csatisfy\u201d Washington.\n\n\u201cIt is good, though painful, that the masks have fallen,\u201d he said, describing the deal as a betrayal of Islam and Arabs.\n\n\u2018FALL LIKE DOMINOES\u2019\n\nSome worshippers at Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, where Palestinians want to establish the capital of a future state, carried pictures of UAE Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed with the word \u201ctraitor\u201d underneath his image.\n\n\u201cJust like Egypt, Jordan and now Abu Dhabi, the whole Arab world will start to fall like dominoes,\u201d said Mohammad al-Sharif, 45, a member of Israel\u2019s Arab minority. \u201cThat Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed and his dirty dogs look out for themselves and their interests and the rest of us can go to hell.\u201d\n\nPalestine Liberation Organization Secretary General Saeb Erekat spelled out the potential consequences for his people if a united Arab front splintered.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing that we based our strategy on as Arabs is that the (2002) Arab peace initiative specified that once Israel withdraws, there will be peace between Arabs and Israelis.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu came determined, with Kushner, Trump... to change the formula, that they want Arab recognition of Israel while they continue with the occupation, and the United Arab Emirates yesterday stamped the green light for this,\u201d Erekat said.\n\nTURKEY MAY SHUT EMBASSY\n\nTurkey, a powerful regional rival of the UAE, said history would not forgive the Gulf country for making a deal which undercut the 2002 Arab peace plan, which had proposed peace in return for Israeli withdrawal from all occupied territory.\n\n\u201cWe may also take a step in the direction of suspending diplomatic ties with the Abu Dhabi leadership or pulling back our ambassador,\u201d President Tayyip Erdogan said after Friday prayers, adding that he could close Turkey\u2019s embassy.\n\nBut, in a region beset with other challenges including civil wars, poverty and economic crisis, some people appeared to have other concerns.\n\nAt Istanbul\u2019s landmark Hagia Sophia, converted by Erdogan to a mosque last month in a move which he portrayed as a step towards restoring \u201cfreedom\u201d to Al Aqsa in Jerusalem, worshippers who spoke to Reuters were unaware of the announcement.\n\nINCENTIVE FOR PEACE\n\nEgypt and Jordan, which signed peace deals with Israel in 1979 and 1994 respectively and enjoy close ties with the UAE, both welcomed the agreement. Jordan said the pact could make a beneficial impact if it spurred Israel to accept a Palestinian state on land it took in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\n\u201cIf Israel deals with it as an incentive to end occupation..., it will move the region towards a just peace,\u201d Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said.\n\nIsraeli Police officers take away an anti-Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan poster from Palestinian demonstrators during a protest against the United Arab Emirates, in front of the Dome of the Rock, in Jerusalem's Old City, August 14, 2020. REUTERS/Ammar Awad\n\nOman and Bahrain praised the accord but Saudi Arabia, which has in the past led Arab policy towards Israel and hosts Islam\u2019s two holiest sites, has remained silent, as have Kuwait and Qatar. [L8N2FG22C]\n\nJordan\u2019s former foreign minister, Marwan al-Muasher, said it was possible other Gulf states could follow Abu Dhabi\u2019s lead. But none of those could address the root problem.\n\n\u201cIn the end it\u2019s not the Gulf states who are living under occupation, it\u2019s the Palestinians. And until you reach a solution with the Palestinians, it does not matter how many peace deals you make with Arab states,\u201d he told Reuters.", "METADATA": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "middle-east", "DCSext.ChannelList": "middle-east;islamic-state;worldNews;IN-The-Wire;INWire_EL;everythingNews", "description": "From cries of \"betrayal\" to fears about \"falling dominoes\", the deal making the United Arab Emirates the third Arab state to forge ties with Israel stirred anger and dismay around the Middle East, but a cautious welcome from the UAE's Gulf allies.", "Author": "Rami Ayyub", "keywords": "UK,ISRAEL,EMIRATES,REACTION,Israel,Palestinian Territories,United Arab Emirates,South,Eastern Europe,Picture available,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Middle East (Energy),Video,Saudi Arabia,General News,Major News,Europe,Middle East,US Government News,Pictures,Presidential Elections,Turkey", "news_keywords": "UK;ISRAEL;EMIRATES;REACTION;Israel;Palestinian Territories;United Arab Emirates;South;Eastern Europe;Picture available;Diplomacy / Foreign Policy;Middle East (Energy);Video;Saudi Arabia;General News;Major News;Europe;Middle East;US Government News;Pictures;Presidential Elections;Turkey", "REVISION_DATE": "Fri Aug 14 20:29:07 UTC 2020", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2020-08-14T20:29:07+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Rami Ayyub", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-israel-emirates-reaction-idINKCN25A2R5", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "UAE's Israel deal met with Arab dismay but quiet welcome in Gulf", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "IN", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "UK,ISRAEL,EMIRATES,REACTION,Israel,Palestinian Territories,United Arab Emirates,South,Eastern Europe,Picture available,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Middle East (Energy),Video,Saudi Arabia,General News,Major News,Europe,Middle East,US Government News,Pictures,Presidential Elections,Turkey", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "UK-ISRAEL-EMIRATES-REACTION", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "Slideshow", "analyticsAttributes.title": "UAE's Israel deal met with Arab dismay but quiet welcome in Gulf", "sailthru.author": "Rami Ayyub", "sailthru.date": "2020-08-14T20:29:07+0000", "sailthru.title": "UAE's Israel deal met with Arab dismay but quiet welcome in Gulf", "og": {"locale": "en_IN", "site_name": "IN", "title": "UAE's Israel deal met with Arab dismay but quiet welcome in Gulf", "url": "https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-israel-emirates-reaction-idINKCN25A2R5", "type": "article", "description": "From cries of \"betrayal\" to fears about \"falling dominoes\", the deal making the United Arab Emirates the third Arab state to forge ties with Israel stirred anger and dismay around the Middle East, but a cautious welcome from the UAE's Gulf allies.", "image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200814&t=2&i=1529681823&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7D1OD", "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-14T20:29:07+0000", "modified_time": "2020-08-14T20:29:07+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Rami Ayyub", "tag": "UK,ISRAEL,EMIRATES,REACTION,Israel,Palestinian Territories,United Arab Emirates,South,Eastern Europe,Picture available,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Middle East (Energy),Video,Saudi Arabia,General News,Major News,Europe,Middle East,US Government News,Pictures,Presidential Elections,Turkey"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/india.reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ReutersIndia", "creator": "@ReutersIndia", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "UAE's Israel deal met with Arab dismay but quiet welcome in Gulf", "description": "From cries of \"betrayal\" to fears about \"falling dominoes\", the deal making the United Arab Emirates the third Arab state to forge ties with Israel stirred anger and dismay around the Middle East, but a cautious welcome from the UAE's Gulf allies.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200814&t=2&i=1529681823&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7D1OD", "src": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200814&t=2&i=1529681823&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG7D1OD"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "in.reuters/world/middleeast/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Home", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
