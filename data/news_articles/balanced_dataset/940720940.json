improved roads across CQ", "TEXT": "CENTRAL Queensland agricultural leaders are advocating for upgraded infrastructure across the region to reduce travel costs and create more opportunities for local producers.\n\nAgForce\u2019s Transport Committee chair Caroline Harris said up to half of a primary producer\u2019s expenses were being spent on transport, which could be avoided if infrastructure was improved.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that government investment in road infrastructure hasn\u2019t kept pace with development in regional communities, rural industries, or farm machinery and technology \u2013 astonishing, considering that nearly half of the State\u2019s economy is generated outside greater Brisbane,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAgriculture \u2013 as one of the declared essential services \u2013 is prepared to do the heavy lifting when it comes to the post-COVID economic recovery, but we need infrastructure that enables us to do so.\u201d\n\nCQ AgForce president John Baker, who runs a cattle property at Middlemount, said the cost of transport could be significantly reduced for producers if roads allowed for a better combination of trucks and trailers.\n\nHe said producers were forced to downsize trucks when they neared larger towns and travelled on certain routes.\n\n\u201cYou can use a type two road train but then you have to break it down to a smaller truck when you reach a certain point\u201d, depending on where they\u2019re travelling and what roads are used.\n\n\u201cIf they improve the road network so you can take three trailers to Rockhampton rather than switching vehicles, it would reduce the cost.\u201d\n\nMr Baker said it was an inconvenience and increased running costs, but was something many producers were forced to deal with.\n\nHe said producers in the Central Highlands and the Banana Shire could have to switch vehicles up to three times, depending on where they were travelling.\n\nHe said while many road upgrades were being carried out, there were also many substandard bridges across the region that hadn\u2019t been upgraded, which wouldn\u2019t hold larger combination trucks.\n\nProducers are forced to reduce the size of the truck simply because the bridges haven\u2019t been upgraded with the roads, which Mr Baker said was what happened between Biloela and Gladstone.\n\nMr Baker said it would be great if the government and planners would sit down with industry to see what the preferred routes were and to draw up a proper plan of a road transport network to benefit industries across the state.\n\n\u201cThings we\u2019ve been advocating for is an inland north-south route as an alternative to the Bruce Hwy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe inland roads aren\u2019t up to a good enough standard to hold all that extra freight so they need to create an overarching plan and have more than one option.\u201d\n\nReduced travel costs and better access to ports would create more cashflow for the producers to spend in the community and would also potentially open up more markets, Mr Baker said.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to have a long-term strategy to ensure investment balances those needs and supports opportunities in regional, not just metropolitan, Queensland,\u201d Mrs Harris said.", "METADATA": {"description": "Upgraded infrastructure across the region would drive down transport costs and
