The cost is N8.49bn to procure the items that are involved. There is a total of 12 items; the quantities involved are large numbers, which will be sent out later.\u201d\n\nKanyiDaily recalls that a few months ago, the NCDC Director General, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, said that Nigeria is in desperate need of more coronavirus testing kits.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ZOOMWORDS": "Nigerian Government Approves N8.5 Billion For NCDC To Buy More Coronavirus Testing Kits - OnlineNigeria.com", "ZOOMIMAGE": "https://cdn.onlinenigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nigerian-government-approves-n8-5-billion-for-ncdc-to-buy-more-coronavirus-testing-kits.jpg?iv=153", "og": {"image": "https://cdn.onlinenigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nigerian-government-approves-n8-5-billion-for-ncdc-to-buy-more-coronavirus-testing-kits.jpg?iv=153", "title": "Nigerian Government Approves N8.5 Billion For NCDC To Buy More Coronavirus Testing Kits", "description": "The Federal Government has approved the sum of N8.49 billion for the procurement of 12 items for the testing of coronavirus pandemic by the Nigeria Centre for\u2026", "locale": "en_US", "type": "Nigerian Government Approves N8.5 Billion For NCDC To Buy More Coronavirus Testing Kits - OnlineNigeria.com", "url": "https://onlinenigeria.com/stories/122724-nigerian-government-approves-n8-5-billion-for-ncdc-to-buy-more-coronavirus-testing-kits.html", "site_name": "OnlineNigeria.com"}, "Description": "The Federal Government has approved the sum of N8.49 billion for the procurement of 12 items for the testing of coronavirus pandemic by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).
