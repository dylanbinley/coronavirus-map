The organisation assumed that the COVID-19 pandemic would be largely contained and that economic activity will increase by 4.7pc on the year.\n\nOPEC has reduced the projected call on its own members\u2019 crude oil to 23.4mn b/d in 2020, down by 400,000 b/d from the previous month and a fall of 5.9mn b/d from 2019. The call on OPEC crude oil in 2021 has also been revised down by 500,000 b/d from the previous month to stand at 29.3mn b/d.\n\nThe reduction in the projected call on OPEC crude oil in 2020 follows a rise in the forecast for non-OPEC members supply to 62.11mn b/d in 2020, down by 3.03mn b/d on the year. Its previous projection was for a 3.26mn b/d decline.\n\nBut OPEC expects non-OPEC members crude oil supply to rise in the third quarter, starting from this month.\n\nIt sees production growth this year from Norway, Brazil, Guyana and Australia and declines mainly from the United States, Russia, Canada, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Colombia and Azerbaijan.\n\nIt expects a smaller decline in US production at 1.32mn b/d in 2020 on the year, up by 46,000 b/d from its previous projection as it anticipated higher production in the second half of the year.\n\nThe cartel has increased its non-OPEC members supply forecast for 2021 by 66,000 b/d to 63.10mn b/d, up by 980,000 b/d on the year, mainly as a result of better-than-expected recovery in Canada\u2019s production.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, uncertainty surrounding financial and logistical constraints for US production, as well as a potential second wave of COVID-19 infections globally, remains a concern,\u201d the cartel\u2019s report said.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2018/11/OPEC.jpg", "secure_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2018/11/OPEC.jpg", "width": 1436, "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "OPEC Raises Non-members\u2019 Supply Forecast for 2020 - THISDAYLIVE", "description": "By Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has revised upwards its forecast for non-OPEC members\u2019 oil supply this year, leading to a fall in the projected call on its own members\u2019 crude oil.
