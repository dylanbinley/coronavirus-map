Christians form a minority in the predominantly Islamic nation and religious buildings are often protected by fences and security guards, he said.\n\nTriggered by the harm inflicted on Catholic statues in Canada, Susilo felt prompted to start a Facebook group which he called \u201cProtecting our Sacred Statues\u201d in hopes of building a community, raising concerns and generating ideas on how to keep church property safe.\n\n\u201cComing to Canada when I was a little boy, it felt nice that we have religious freedom,\u201d said Susilo, who was born and raised in a Catholic family. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the pressure of having a religion or pressure to be Muslim because being a Muslim is more accepted back home.\u201d\n\nRecent cases of church vandalism in Canada began in late May and have seen damage done to Our Lady of Lourdes Grotto in Sudbury, Ont., St. Patrick\u2019s Parish in Markham, Sacred Heart Church in Calgary and the Basilica of Our Lady in Guelph, Ont. Police have not established a motive for the attacks and continue to investigate. Catholic churches have also been targeted across the United States, at the same time when many statues of Confederate leaders were toppled during protests after the killing of a Black man, George Floyd, at the hands of the Minneapolis police.\n\nSusilo, who attends St. Michael\u2019s Cathedral Basilica in Toronto, says the open environment around churches is a welcoming mark of Canadian identity which he would hate to see change due to vandalism.\n\n\u201cI feel so good that I can go to church and it doesn\u2019t have a sky-high gate for protection,\u201d said Susilo, who works for the Indonesian consulate in Toronto. \u201cI feel safe in Canada, but when these things are happening, it reminds me of back home and makes me feel we have to do something about it.\u201d\n\nPatrick Redmond, a parishioner at St. Patrick\u2019s and a member of the Knights of Columbus, was especially hurt by the vandalism at his church in July, which included damage to a statue depicting Mary lifting Jesus off the cross. For him, it was an attack on a labour of love he still vividly recalls 10 years later.\n\n\u201cThere was an Italian parishioner who carved these statues and he was getting old and moving on to another parish and wanted to donate them to the church,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI was one of the Knights who went to the sculptor\u2019s house and brought the statues to the church. We laid the foundations down and put them up.\u201d\n\nThe damage to the statues is being handled by insurance.\n\nSusilo, who is part of a ministry at St. Patrick\u2019s Church in downtown Toronto that prepares sandwiches for the homeless every Wednesday, is optimistic that the good work that people of faith are doing could help deter copycats by bringing understanding to what these pieces mean to the Catholic community in the nation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of people who could care less about statues, but they mean so much to people like me,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to do more. I want to see if people would help me protect not the just statues but the Church.\n\n\u201cWe have to protect our home.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "keywords": "Statues,statues vandalized", "author": "Wendy-Ann Clarke, The Catholic Register", "og": {"url": "https://www.catholicregister.org/item/31976-new-group-s-goal-is-protecting-statues", "type": "article", "title": "New group\u2019s goal is protecting statues", "description": "Canadians enjoy religious freedom unlike many in other parts of the world, so for Jeffrey Susilo the thought that recent church vandalism could be evidence that those freedoms might be under attack is disheartening. &nbsp; Born in Indonesia where he lived until he was 14 years old, Susillo says he i...", "image": "https://www.catholicregister.org/media/k2/items/cache/9294dbc10710ba8bb35d965c563e99eb_L.jpg"}, "image": "https://www.catholicregister.org/media/k2/items/cache/9294dbc10710ba8bb35d965c563e99eb_L.jpg", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@CatholicRegistr", "title": "New group\u2019s goal is protecting statues", "description": "Canadians enjoy religious freedom unlike many in other parts of the world, so for Jeffrey Susilo the thought that recent church vandalism could be evidence that those freedoms might be under attack is...", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.catholicregister.org/media/k2/items/cache/9294dbc10710ba8bb35d965c563e99eb_L.jpg", "alt": "A statue of Mary lifting Jesus off the cross was one of two statues vandalized at St. Patrick\u2019s Parish."}}, "description": "Canadians enjoy religious freedom unlike many in other parts of the world, so for Jeffrey Susilo the thought that recent church vandalism could be evi...", "generator": "Website design by Concerto Designs concertodesigns.ca"}}}
