Venezuela had few options for obtaining gasoline after the United States seized four Iranian fuel shipments en route to the fuel-starved South American country, where protests intensified over widespread gasoline shortages. The US maintains sanctions on the oil industries of both countries.\n\nOil refineries in once-prosperous OPEC member Venezuela have capacity to process some 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, but they are producing little fuel due to years of underinvestment and mismanagement at state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela.\n\nThe shipments in May and June from Iran \u2014 which US officials have said were paid for in gold \u2014 provided a temporary respite from lengthy lines at service stations in many parts of Venezuela. But there are growing signs of worsening fuel shortages in recent days.\n\nProtests over gasoline shortages erupted in the western state of Lara and the eastern state of Monagas this week, images posted on social media showed.\n\nIn July, two men were fatally shot in separate crackdowns by security forces on demonstrations over fuel shortages.\n\n\u201cThe country should understand that the gasoline issue is here to stay,\u201d opposition lawmaker Jos Guerra told reporters on Friday. \u201cThere is no way to resolve this problem now until the refineries\u2019 problems are fixed.\u201d US sanctions have complicated PDVSA\u2019s swaps of crude exports for gasoline imports, exacerbating shortages. Venezuela has received no gasoline imports since Iran sent the tankers.\n\nIn July and August, Venezuela received a total of just 1 million barrels of foreign fuel between diesel and naphtha shipments, internal PDVSA documents show.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 15th, 2020", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "subject": "Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.", "description": "\u201cWith the assistance of foreign partners, this seized property is now in US custody,\u201d says US Justice Department.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383068068604634, "pages": 86398345441}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "DAWN.COM", "url": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1574488", "type": "article", "title": "US claims seizure of Iranian fuel on Venezuela-bound ships", "description": "\u201cWith the assistance of foreign partners, this seized property is now in US custody,\u201d says US Justice Department.", "image": "https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/08/5f370bc50f9e0.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@dawn_com", "url": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1574488", "title": "US claims seizure of Iranian fuel on Venezuela-bound ships", "description": "\u201cWith the assistance of foreign partners, this seized property is now in US custody,\u201d says US Justice Department.", "image": "https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/08/5f370bc50f9e0.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.dawn.com", "published_time": "2020-08-15 06:58:20", "modified_time": "2020-08-15 10:55:37", "author": "https://www.dawn.com/authors/122/agencies"}, "author": "Agencies"}}}
