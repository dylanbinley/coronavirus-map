In 2016, Schmitt re-founded Uniter with a similar structure to Hannibal.\n\nBy late 2019, Uniter claimed 2,000 members, including former Hannibal members and members of the military and intelligence communities, although the actual numbers remain unknown. A co-founder of Uniter was a domestic intelligence agent and Schmitt insinuated to journalists that Uniter had support within military intelligence.\n\nIn late 2019, Uniter lost its non-profit status in Germany and moved headquarters to Switzerland. Investigations uncovered stolen military items and footage of illegal paramilitary exercises and in June this year Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, confirmed that Uniter was under investigation for its links to right-wing extremism.\n\nGermany\u2019s equivalent to MI5, the BfV has its own worrying links to the far right \u2014 in particular the most notorious neo-Nazi terror group in recent German history, the National-Socialist Underground (NSU).\n\nThe NSU carried out multiple bombings, 43 attempted killings and 10 murders \u2014 mostly of people of Turkish heritage \u2014 over 13 years up to 2011. The NSU also possessed a list of 10,000 potential targets, including Christian Democrat (CDU) local politician Walter Lubcke, who was murdered by a far-right extremist in June 2019.\n\nSeveral members of the NSU network were paid BfV informers, while an intelligence agent was present at one of the murders and the BfV itself actively obstructed investigations when the group was exposed. Shortly after the group\u2019s existence became public in 2011, many BfV files related to the NSU were destroyed \u2014 some after the investigation had begun.\n\nBfV president Heinz Fromm resigned in disgrace, but remaining files on the NSU have been redacted or remain inaccessible. During the trial, BfV agents and informants only gave limited testimony \u2014 and in some cases, none at all.\n\nFromm\u2019s successor at the BfV, Hans-Georg Maassen, did no better. When right-wing mobs were filmed \u201chunting\u201d foreigners in the streets of Chemnitz in 2018, Maassen claimed to have seen no evidence \u2014 and questioned the veracity of footage. It was soon revealed that Maassen had passed a sensitive BfV report on right-wing extremism to an MP of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).\n\nFacing outcry, Maassen was promoted sideways into the Interior Ministry, before being placed on early retirement after accusing \u201cradical left-wing\u201d forces in the government of conspiring against him for criticising the government\u2019s \u201cnaive\u201d and \u201cleft-wing\u201d security and migration policies.\n\nThe AfD \u2014 with 89 seats in German parliament \u2014 is itself a major source of extremism. Last year, a German court ruled that calling Bjorn Hocke \u2014 co-leader of the AfD\u2019s hard-line wing, Der Flugel (The Wing) \u2014 a fascist \u201crests on verifiable fact.\u201d\n\nIn March, the BfV classified Der Flugel as an active threat to democracy, placing it under surveillance and many of Der Flugel\u2019s 7,000 members \u2014 one fifth of the AfD total membership \u2014 were among the 32,000 cases identified by the latest BfV report on right-wing extremism.\n\nFollowing the BfV\u2019s classification, the party leadership forced the group to formally disband, but its members remain active and influential in the AfD.\n\nNonetheless, Germany\u2019s conservative CDU remains divided over whether to work with the increasingly radicalised AfD. Stuck in a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d government with the centre-left Social Democrats, some CDU members see the solution to the party\u2019s identity crisis in adopting a more right-wing position and breaching the \u201ccordon sanitaire\u201d around the AfD.\n\nThis strategy almost came to fruition in the eastern state of Thuringia in February, where the CDU and the liberal FDP cut a deal with the AfD\u2019s leader in the state parliament \u2014 the fascist Bjorn Hocke \u2014 to oust the left from government. A wave of revulsion swept the country, forcing a backflip, but the debate in the CDU continues.\n\nThe growth of the AfD has also had an emboldening effect on extremists. Since April, Martina Renner, MP for the left-wing Die Linke in Thuringia, has received seven threatening letters, signed \u201cNSU 2.0.\u201d Die Linke\u2019s MP in Hesse, Janine Wissler, received multiple death threats in February, also signed \u201cNSU 2.0.\u201d\n\nDays after going public, Wissler received another message. Worryingly, the threats included sensitive personal information taken from police databases. Similar threats sent to lawyer Basay-Yildiz, who represented victims\u2019 families in the NSU trial, also indicated police involvement. A right-wing chat group of government officials was discovered and several civil servants lost their jobs, but no one was charged.\n\nIn late July, Hesse\u2019s interior ministry confirmed that at least 69 similar messages had been sent to 27 people in recent months \u2014 mostly women, people of migrant background, or on the political left \u2014 and hundreds more death threats signed \u201cNSU 2.0\u201d have also been sent to prominent Muslims and immigrants in the last two years.\n\nIn at least three recent cases, contact details appear to have been taken from police computers. Peter Beuth, Hesse\u2019s interior minister, insisted there was \u201cno proof\u201d of a right-wing network within the police, but could not rule it out.\n\nDespite 60 law-enforcement officers, at least 30 witnesses and an Interpol inquiry dragging on for over two years, there has been no real progress in finding those behind the letters, and trust in the Hesse police is seriously damaged.\n\nSuch mistrust is well placed. An August 7 article in Der Spiegel revealed that in recent years German federal and state authorities have investigated around 400 cases of right-wing extremist, racist or anti-semitic activities among police officers and trainees. With 70 suspected cases, the state of Hesse was by far the worst.\n\nGermany\u2019s problem with the far-right runs long and deep \u2014 both inside and outside the state and even within the very state agencies meant to monitor the threat. After years of official apathy, the far-right\u2019s penetration of Germany\u2019s security apparatus has reached a point where authorities are now struggling to combat it.\n\nThe very sobering suspicion in everyone\u2019s mind is that these cells and networks of extremists are everywhere \u2014 in the army, the police, the reserves, the intelligence agencies.\n\nWhile it remains unlikely that a single unified network exists across the country, only the tip of the iceberg has been discovered and even small groups of armed extremists are dangerous enough to take deadly seriously.\n\nA large number of Germans with far-right sympathies have been emboldened by the migration crisis of 2015 and the growth of the AfD and their increasingly extreme rhetoric \u2014 and are increasingly likely to take direct action to further their rotten worldview.\n\nThis rise in violent neo-fascism also poses a unique series of challenges as capitalism heads into a new economic crisis. While the danger of armed extremist networks is very real, the greater threat remains political.\n\nShould far-right parties like the AfD manage to exploit further the social impact of the downturn, their success will not only encourage further acts of fascist violence.\n\nUnless the excesses of neoliberal austerity can be reversed and replaced with a new, fairer, social model \u2014 it also raises the frightening prospect of the far-right entering government in Germany for the first time since World War Two.", "METADATA": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "description": "In the conclusion of a two-part series, DUROYAN FERTL reveals weapons dumps and plans for a \u201cDay X\u201d slaughter in a country where even the police force has seen 400 investigations of right-wing extremism", "keywords": "Germany, Nazis, neonazis, far right", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Star", "type": "article", "title": "Germany\u2019s Nazi problem: Hannibal\u2019s Secret Army", "url": "https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/f/germany-nazi-problem-hannibal-secret-army", "description": "In the conclusion of a two-part series, DUROYAN FERTL reveals weapons dumps and plans for a \u201cDay X\u201d slaughter in a country where even the police force has seen 400 investigations of right-wing extremism", "updated_time": "2020-08-13T12:58:46+01:00", "image": "https://morningstaronline.co.uk/sites/all/themes/custom/morningstar_online/morning-star-default.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "url": "https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/f/germany-nazi-problem-hannibal-secret-army", "title": "Germany\u2019s Nazi problem: Hannibal\u2019s Secret Army", "description": "In the conclusion of a two-part series, DUROYAN FERTL reveals weapons dumps and plans for a \u201cDay X\u201d slaughter in a country where even the police force has seen 400 investigations of right-wing", "image": "https://morningstaronline.co.uk/sites/default/files/web_pic_neo-nazi.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-12T12:15:03+01:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T12:58:46+01:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
