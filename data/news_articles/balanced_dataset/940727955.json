( Supplied: Kevin Reilly )\n\nDFES declined to answer specific questions from the ABC, instead providing a statement saying in part that the impacts on Faraway Bay would be reviewed but compensation was not possible.\n\n\"The events at Faraway Bay will be reviewed as part of DFES's continual improvement of the aerial-controlled burning program, including its procedures and any unintended consequences to property owners,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Under the Fire and Emergency Services Act and the Bush Fires Act, DFES is unable to provide compensation for damage caused by bushfire, including that caused through mitigation activities.\"\n\nThe statement from DFES also said that Faraway Bay declined bushfire mitigation assistance earlier in the year.\n\n\"It should also be noted that in April 2020 the Kimberley Land Council (KLC) offered Faraway Bay assistance to conduct mitigation activities around Faraway Bay infrastructure, but this was declined,\" the statement read.\n\nFind more local news Tell us your location and find more local ABC News and information\n\nMs Reilly says the KLC offered to conduct mitigation burning for a fee, but this was declined as the tourism venture conducted their own preparations.\n\nShe said now the business had to add bushfire repair work to the losses caused by the pandemic shutdown.\n\n\"The thing that's frustrating when you're going remote, it's the cost of getting the supplies in, bringing labour in, it's quite an involved procedure,\" Ms Reilly said.\n\n\"We will then have to claim through our insurers. We then are penalised with higher premiums.\"\n\nFaraway Bay wilderness retreat on the far north Kimberley coast before the bushfire in July 2020.
