The operation was successful thanks to the collaboration of the public, the army said.\n\nThe woman, a mother of three was kidnapped, brutalised, killed and then beheaded on Tuesday by the armed separatists who accused her of conniving with government forces to leak their hideouts.\n\nThe murder was widely condemned in Cameroon after the suspects filmed the gruesome act and posted the video online.\n\nSeparatists have been seeking to secede from the majority French-speaking Cameroon and create an independent nation in the two Anglophone regions of Northwest and Southwest which they call \"Ambazonia.\" They have been clashing with government forces since 2017.
