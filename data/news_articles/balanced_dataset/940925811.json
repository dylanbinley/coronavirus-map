The arrangement will immediately make available $500 million once executed and the remaining half later.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the media, Minority Spokesperson on Finance Cassiel Ato Forson argued the move is inimical to the progress of the nation. According to him, government has already spent two million dollars on consultancy and legal fees for the deal.\n\n\n\nThe Africa Legal and Associates owned by Gabby Otchere Darko which serves as legal advisor to government for the transaction has already been paid $1 million the minority argues\n\n\n\nFormer Deputy Attorney General and Chairman for the subsidiary legislation Committee Dr. Dominic Ayine argued the arrangement has some legal challenges. According to him the Minerals Income Amendment Act from which the agreement is drawing its authority has not been assented to by the President. Former deputy power Minister John Jinapor questioned why such a crucial agreement must be smuggled through on the last day of sitting\n\n\n\nBut the majority says the move is good for the nation. Adentan MP Yaw Buaben Asamoa and Sekondi MP Andrew Egyap-Mercer argued the arrangement is an innovative way of raising funds for development of the nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer GhanaWeb is not responsible for the reportage or opinions of contributors published on the website.
