Bonang Mohale, Chairperson - Bidvest\n\nBusiness has been quite firm that the prevention of looting is much better than the cure. Bonang Mohale, Chairperson - Bidvest\n\nIn May the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation and several civil society organisations made practical recommendations to monitor how the R500bn was going to be spent by government. Bonang Mohale, Chairperson - Bidvest\n\nWe are now in the midst of the period of lowest confidence, trust, and hope since the second world war. Bonang Mohale, Chairperson - Bidvest\n\nWe just recovered from the nine wasted years of state capture, we're now in a technical recession, Moody\u2019s downgrade. Covid-19 found us faced-down and finish. We've had years of Eskom\u2019s rolling blackouts, the 2018 VBS bank looting, intermittent water supply, and now this daylight pillage.
