It could also help bolster Trump\u2019s relection hopes in the November US polls.\n\nThe Palestinian leadership rejected the deal as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of their cause, saying they would withdraw their ambassador from the Emirates.\n\nFollowing Friday prayers in Jerusalem, worshippers outside the Al-Aqsa mosque walked on pictures of UAE strongman Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan.\n\nIn the West Bank city of Nablus, people set fire to pictures of Sheikh Mohamed, Netanyahu and Trump.\n\nIn Ramallah, office worker Jihad Hussein said: \u201cThe Palestinian people have been stabbed in the back by the Emirates leadership.\u201d\n\n\u2018Full normalisation\u2019\n\nEstablishing diplomatic ties between Israel and Washington\u2019s Middle East allies, including the oil-rich Gulf monarchies, has been central to Trump\u2019s regional strategy to contain Iran, also an arch-foe of Israel.\n\nTehran on Friday condemned the deal as an act of \u201cstrategic stupidity\u201d that would only strengthen the Iranian-backed \u201caxis of resistance\u201d.\n\nIran\u2019s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also had talks with Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Islamist Palestinian movement Hamas which rules Gaza, on ways of \u201cfoundering\u201d the deal, Hamas.\n\nHezbollah, Iran\u2019s powerful Lebanese ally, denounced the deal.\n\n\u201cThis is a betrayal of Islam and Arabism, it is a betrayal of Jerusalem, of the Palestinian people,\u201d Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said.\n\n\u201cWhat the UAE did was give a personal electoral favour to President Trump,\u201d he added.\n\nUnder the deal, Israel and the UAE \u201cagreed to the full normalisation of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates\u201d, according to a joint statement issued by Trump, Netanyahu and Sheikh Mohamed.\n\nThey added that Israel would \u201csuspend declaring sovereignty\u201d over occupied Palestinian West Bank areas \u2014 an idea proposed in Trump\u2019s controversial peace plan unveiled earlier this year.\n\nSheikh Mohamed stressed in a tweet that an agreement has been \u201creached to stop further Israeli annexation of Palestinian territories\u201d.\n\nBut Netanyahu insisted afterwards that he had only agreed to delay, not cancel, the annexations. The plans remained \u201con the table\u201d, he said.\n\nOn Friday, the prime minister appointed his national security advisor Meir Ben-Shabbat to lead the negotiations with the Emiratis.\n\nUS Gulf allies Bahrain and Oman welcomed the annexation deal, and Egypt, which signed 1979 peace treaty with Israel, praised a deal that would scrap annexation.\n\nThanking them, Netanyahu said the \u201cpeace treaty\u201d with the UAE was \u201cexpanding the circle of peace\u201d.\n\nThe European Union said normalisation would benefit both Israel and the UAE, but foreign policy spokeswoman Nabila Massrali stressed the bloc\u2019s commitment to a two-state solution.\n\nTurkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a longtime critic of Israel and frequently at odds with Western powers, threatened to suspend diplomatic relations with the UAE or withdraw Ankara\u2019s ambassador.\n\n\u2018Not everyone will applaud\u2019\n\nThere was no immediate word from regional heavyweight and UAE ally Saudi Arabia, who sponsored in 2002 a peace plan calling for Israel\u2019s complete withdrawal from territories occupied in 1967 in exchange for peace and the full normalisation of ties with the Arab world.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that King Salman will be at least a little annoyed, since this breaks the Arab consensus that the Arab Peace Initiative is the guiding basis for all major diplomacy with Israel,\u201d said Hussein Ibish, an analyst at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.\n\nOmar Saif Ghobash, UAE assistant Minister for Culture and Public Diplomacy, told AFP the deal was designed to \u201cshake up\u201d the Middle East impasse and serve his country\u2019s interests.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t consult with anybody, we didn\u2019t inform anybody, and as a sovereign state we don\u2019t feel that we have the obligation to do that,\u201d Ghobash said, asked if Riyadh was consulted in advance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to be expected that not everybody will\u2026 applaud or comment,\u201d he added.\n\nThe controversial Trump plan, unveiled in January, had offered a path for Israel to annex the Jordan Valley and Jewish settlements across the West Bank, communities considered illegal under international law.\n\nThe Palestinians had rejected the plan outright as biased and untenable, as did Israel\u2019s Arab neighbours, and it sparked fears of more violence.\n\nUN chief Antonio Guterres said he hoped Israel\u2019s suspension of annexations under the plan could help realise a two-state solution with the Palestinians.\n\n", "METADATA": {"fb": {"pages": 176502461635, "app_id": 1056657517707298}, "description": "World leaders voiced hope Friday that a historic deal between the UAE and Israel could kickstart moribund Middle East peace talks, even as the Palestinians...", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "World leaders praise Israel-UAE deal as Palestinians cry foul", "description": "World leaders voiced hope Friday that a historic deal between the UAE and Israel could kickstart moribund Middle East peace talks, even as the Palestinians...", "url": "https://guardian.ng/news/world-leaders-praise-israel-uae-deal-as-palestinians-cry-foul/", "site_name": "The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News", "image": "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/000_1WI1U1-640x360.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ngrguardian", "tag": "Israel-UAE deal", "section": "News", "published_time": "2020-08-14T19:25:34+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "World leaders voiced hope Friday that a historic deal between the UAE and Israel could kickstart moribund Middle East peace talks, even as the Palestinians...", "title": "World leaders praise Israel-UAE deal as Palestinians cry foul", "site": "@GuardianNigeria", "image": "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/000_1WI1U1-640x360.jpg", "creator": "@NGRGUARDIANNEWS"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.9.5", "news_keywords": "Benjamin Netanyahu, Donald Trump, Israel-UAE deal"}}}
