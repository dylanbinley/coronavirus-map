The factory consumes some 4,800 tonnes of milk annually to produce about 500 tonnes of fresh Italian cheese such as mozzarella, burrata and scamorza, and ricotta.\n\nWith this move, the company headquartered at Sharjah Food Park, is set to become one of the largest Italian dairy factories across the UAE.\n\nAl Mazrouei was speaking after touring the newly developed facilities along with a number of officials and directors of the free zone.
