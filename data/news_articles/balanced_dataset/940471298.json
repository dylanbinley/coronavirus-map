Over the last 28 days, new cases of Covid-19 in Fiji decreased or stabilised.\"\n\nThe CDC said policies in Fiji may require US travellers to be tested for the coronavirus before being allowed to enter the country.\n\n\"If you test positive on arrival, you may be required to isolate for a period of time.\n\n\"You may even be prevented from returning to the United States as scheduled. You might consider getting tested before your trip.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Fiji's Health Ministry said there were seven active Covid-cases in the country, all of them from border quarantine and stable in hospital.", "METADATA": {"Generator": "ELF", "description": "A high risk designation from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention is being disputed by the top health authority in the Northern Marianas.", "keywords": "Radio New Zealand, RNZ, Public Radio, News, Current Affairs, Audio, Podcasts", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "EAL": "news:423463", "og": {"site_name": "RNZ", "url": "https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/423463/high-risk-designation-irks-cnmi-while-fiji-seen-as-low-risk", "type": "article", "title": "High-risk designation irks CNMI, while Fiji seen as low risk", "description": "A high risk designation from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention is being disputed by the top health authority in the Northern Marianas.", "image": "https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/105356/eight_col_Saipan-1000x500.jpg?1594338359"}, "fb": {"admins": 1076742843, "pages": 116876028325133}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T16:26:13+12:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T16:26:13+12:00", "section": "Pacific"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@radionz", "creator": "@RNZInews", "title": "High-risk designation irks CNMI, while Fiji seen as low risk", "description": "A high risk designation from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention is being disputed by the top health authority in the Northern Marianas.", "image": "https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/105356/eight_col_Saipan-1000x500.jpg?1594338359"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/x/favicons/ms-icon-144x144-cd317fd008139bc4fce0a2a9dd8c1ef48d95cf17810bfcb9b1336042f8203b2a.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}}}
