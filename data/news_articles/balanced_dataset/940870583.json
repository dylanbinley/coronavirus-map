But that bill failed to pass the General Assembly.\n\nThen in January 2013, the state agency that oversees UI and Eversource \u2014 the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority \u2014 issued a detailed report outlining how the legislature could structure what was dubbed a \u201cRefrigerated Spoilage Loss (RSL)\u201d program. But nothing came of PURA\u2019s recommendations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my understanding the legislature never took action to turn the proposal into law, so it remained a feasibility study,\u201d Taren O'Connor, PURA\u2019s director of communications, told Hearst Connecticut Media this week.\n\nWhich is why over the past few days, politicians from both parties have had to resort to trying to publicly shame UI and Eversource over their response to Isaias and the food and medical spoilage that resulted from the length of time it took to get everybody hooked back up.\n\nU.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, urged Eversource to offer refunds \u201cright now\u201d during an appearance Monday at Robert\u2019s Food Center in Madison. The store claimed it lost $300,000 worth of merchandise.\n\nAttorney General William Tong, also a Democrat, echoed those sentiments in a statement Wednesday to Eversource and UI: \u201cDo the right thing ... and reimburse consumers now for lost food and prescriptions. Families were already struggling to pay for groceries before this storm.\u201d\n\nAlso Wednesday, Danbury\u2019s Republican mayor, Mark Boughton, posted on Facebook about Eversource: \u201cGet the lights on, reimburse people for lost perishables, reimburse businesses for lost revenue.\u201d\n\nAnd Thursday, Bridgeport Democratic Mayor Joe Ganim joined in, calling on UI to \u201cconsider giving each resident who lost groceries... a gift card for at least $100 to at least begin to give something back for all the damage and inconvenience.\u201d\n\nConsolidated Edison, the big New York utility, bolstered the argument for elected officials seeking voluntary compliance this week when it agreed to compensate households up to $540 if they could show food losses, and businesses for up to $10,700.\n\nThen on Friday, state Rep. Anne Hughes, D-Easton, and Rep. Raghib Allie-Brennan, D-Bethel, said they would re-introduce the 2012 consumer protection bill.\n\nThe thought now was such a bill would have better luck than the 2012 one did.\n\nWhen that proposal, over the opposition of utilities and along partisan lines, was initially voted out of the legislative Energy and Technology Committee in March 2012, it seemed on a fast track to passage well before the General Assembly\u2019s midnight May 9 adjournment deadline. But under intense lobbying, the proposal stalled out and died.\n\nCurrent state Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, was vice chairman of the energy committee at the time. He remembered the issue as a lost opportunity to help consumers. The bill would also have capped salaries for utility executives at $350,000.\n\n\u201cThe utilities tried to say that reimbursements were impractical and neither clear nor simple,\u201d Duff told Hearst Friday, recalling some of the intense opposition. Tong, a former state representative from Stamford, was also on the energy committee at the time and also voted \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nTestimony from utilities during the 2012 public hearings stressed the need for proving gross negligence in outages resulting in the spoiling of refrigerated food, as well as a means to steer any compensation to lower-income residents only.\n\nBut PURA\u2019s own analysis of and recommendations for a Refrigerated Spoilage Loss program, released in January 2013, were not a slam-dunk for advocates.\n\nAs envisioned by PURA, the spoilage program could have included ratepayer awards of up to $150 for food and $200 for medications. The authority outlined four different alternatives, based on outage data from 2011\u2019s Irene and October nor\u2019easter, with estimated costs to the company of anywhere from $4 million to $487 million.\n\nBut the authority warned Connecticut lawmakers they would be joining what were at the time only five other states \u2014 New York, Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan and California \u2014 in implementing reimbursement rules with \u201ca risk of some unknown magnitude\u201d because it would ultimately be \u201can extra expense to ratepayers ... through increased rates.\u201d\n\nThat was what Fairfield\u2019s Jack Bradley suspected when told this week about the failed legislation designed to make customers like him and his wife whole for lost groceries.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice, but I think we\u2019re going to end up paying for it in the long run,\u201d Bradley said.\n\nPURA\u2019s report stated that \u201cunless directed otherwise by the legislature, if a RSL program is implemented for future outage events, the authority will treat (it) as an acceptable and prudent cost of regulated utility business operations.\u201d\n\nIn other words, customers \u2014 not shareholders \u2014 would foot the bill unless an investigation by PURA cited the utilities for poor performance during a particular outage.\n\nPURA has opened a case on Eversource\u2019s and UI\u2019s responses to Isaias.\n\nBoth UI and Connecticut Light & Power \u2014 then part of Northeast Utilities, now under Eversource using the corporate brand \u2014 raised concerns at the time with PURA about spoilage relief outlined in the authority\u2019s 2013 report.\n\nUI worried such a program would result in future efforts \u201cto reimburse customers for other costs they may incur as a result of prolonged outages.\u201d\n\nAnd CL&P argued homeowners and renters could purchase their own insurance to cover such losses from natural events, something PURA acknowledged in its report.\n\nPURA also grappled with issues of fairness for utility customers in terms of eligibility and the costs of providing an RSL.\n\n\u201cIf the program is limited to low income customers, the remaining non-qualifying customers may view that as unfair or inequitable,\u201d read the report. \u201cIf the program provides a standard or sliding scale ... payment, one can argue that the actual losses may be either over-or-under reimbursed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother fairness issue arises if customers who are reimbursed ... also receive payments from social services programs or homeowner/renter insurance,\u201d PURA stated.\n\nFor example, Bridgeport post-Isaias reminded residents who receive federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Plan benefits that they could request replacement subsidies.\n\nTong\u2019s office said it was not aware of any existing legislation to force the utilities to make customers whole post-Isaias. But, the attorney general told Hearst, \u201cThere is absolutely nothing prohibiting Eversource and UI from choosing to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nAnd, in fact, Eversource recently indicated to investors the company anticipated recovering its own Isaias storm costs without \u201ca material impact to the results of operations\u201d \u2014 meaning profits.\n\nEversource earlier this week issued a statement that echoed CL&P\u2019s seven-year-old argument to PURA against spoilage payback: \u201cWe understand how difficult it is for our customers to be without power. As this was an act of nature, we don\u2019t provide reimbursement, but we encourage our customers to reach out to their insurance carrier to see if it\u2019s in their homeowners or renters policy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile UI, in its own response to the political pressure, said: \u201cWe recognize these are challenging times for our customers and that the outages caused by Tropical Storm Isaias presented an additional unplanned burden.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven that this is just the start of storm season, we welcome the opportunity to work together with regulators and government to explore whether there are other things we should collectively be evaluating in the future to help address the impact on customers,\u201d UI added.\n\nNone of which covers the immediate costs of the food the Bradleys and other UI ratepayers had to throw in the trash.\n\n\u201cThe situation is unacceptable,\u201d Mel Bradley said. \u201cShould companies bear some of the burden of it? I would think they would have to. It is their (electrical) system.\u201d", "METADATA": {"format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "ispremium": 0, "dc.date": "2020-08-14T23:30:00Z",
