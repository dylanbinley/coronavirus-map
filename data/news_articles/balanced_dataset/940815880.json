Demonstrations have grown day on day after the government \u2014 who came to power in a U.S.-baked coup last November \u2014 postponed the elections for the third time. Ollie Vargas, a journalist who witnessed the events firsthand, shared his experiences with MintPress:\n\nWe are in day 12 of Bolivia\u2019s uprising and general strike called by the unions, and the crisis has reached a boiling point. All of the country is paralysed. The key roads in the country have been blocked by people erecting barriers. So it is up to the government to decide whether they want a peaceful route out, which is through elections as soon as possible, with guarantees to end the persecution against the left and the Movement to Socialism Party [MAS], or if they are going to go down the route of more conflict by rejecting that, at which point the movement will begin calling for the ousting of the government. The government will have to start attacking the protesters, in what would have to be basically a military invasion of the country, because this is across every region of Bolivia.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, many observers predict that the coup government, led by Jeanine A\u00f1ez, will choose the latter. MintPress also spoke with Benjamin Dangl, a lecturer at the University of Vermont and the author of the book, \u201cThe Five Hundred Year Rebellion: Indigenous Movements and the Decolonization of History in Bolivia.\u201d \u201cThe government and its right-wing and paramilitary allies in the streets meet protesters\u2019 legitimate demands with racist violence and threats,\u201d he said.\n\nSince last November, the \u00c1\u00f1ez government has carried out grave human rights violations and massacres against political enemies and protesters. Its current handling of protests indicates it is not interested in a peaceful solution to the crisis it has created.\u201d\n\nLate last month, the government postponed elections for a third time, moving them back to October 18. Its justification was the rapidly worsening health situation in the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It has also canceled school for the country\u2019s two million children. No doubt holding an election would indeed be dangerous at the current moment. But many in Bolivia felt the move was a sign the self-declared \u201cinterim government\u201d had little intention of ever giving up power.\n\nOn the 10th day of Bolivia's general strike, more sectors join the protests against the coup government. Today, the town of Konani, La Paz, mobilized as a community to call for democracy.

Dangl noted that the method of protest is a common one in Bolivia, being used extensively by the people during the early 2000s Water and Gas Wars against the privatization of the economy.\n\nThe rising number of protesters involved in road blockades across Bolivia speak to a long tradition of blockades as a form of protest in the country. Bolivian blockaders have toppled dictatorships, ushered in a return to democracy, and kicked out some of the most powerful corporations and banking institutions in the world. Now they are facing down the repressive and undemocratic \u00c1\u00f1ez government. The protests reflect the wide rejection of \u00c1\u00f1ez, and go beyond the MAS base and close supporters of Morales, pointing toward a massive grassroots uprising.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe roadblocks in Bolivia make it impossible for coup officials to escape by land, Vargas said. \u201cIf social movements surround the airports then A\u00f1ez/ [Interior Minister Arturo] Murillo may not make it to Miami. The presidential helicopter can only go short distances.\u201d\n\nIndigenous protesters from the Bolivian town of Palca, are now calling for the resignation of self-declared President Jeanine A\u00f1ez, citing the destruction of education and health services.

It began by sending low flying aircraft over the protests to intimidate them, simulating attacking them as they did during the November massacres. Murillo himself appeared on CNN, arguing that firing on the protesters is the \u201cpolitically correct thing to do.\u201d Far-right paramilitaries began doing just that, shooting and wounding their enemies. The country\u2019s Defense Minister, Fernando Lopez, expressed his support and gratitude to the Christian-fascist group Uni\u00f3n Juvenil Cruce\u00f1ista who carried out many of the attacks. \u201cThey know what to do\u2026they need to send a message,\u201d he said on government broadcaster Bolivia TV.\n\nOusted president Evo Morales warned that the A\u00f1ez government is planning what amounts to a second coup, to establish a military-civilian junta, not unlike the fascist regimes that dominated many South American nations in the 20th century.\n\nThe uprising and the government\u2019s response to it have been given little attention in the Western press, who strongly supported the November coup. When discussed at all, media have described the paramilitaries carrying out government orders merely as \u201carmed civilians,\u201d and not as a key part of the apparatus of oppression.\n\nEven as calls for their resignation have reached a crescendo, the government itself is upping the ante. Last week, it announced that it would charge Morales and a host of MAS leaders, including Luis Arce (the party\u2019s presidential candidate in the oft-postponed election), with attempted genocide, on the grounds that the protesters had stopped ambulances and vehicles containing emergency medical equipment from reaching their destinations. \u201cWhat is [being] done is a crime against humanity,\u201d Murillo said at a press conference in the highland city of Cochabamba. Protest-friendly media like Kawsachun Coca strongly contest this claim, and released footage of protesters clearing roadblocks and helping ambulances through.\n\nPolls show that Arce is, by a long way, the favorite for any election, with 42 percent of the public intending to vote for him. By contrast, A\u00f1ez is likely to garner only 13 percent support in the first round of voting. Thus, the MAS would be on for an even bigger victory than they had in the October elections last year.\n\nA\u00f1ez came to power in a military coup in November, just three weeks after Morales won another election. A strongly conservative Christian, her party received only four percent of the vote. Handpicked by the military, A\u00f1ez arrived at the presidential palace in La Paz clutching an oversized bible and declaring that Christ was returning to government. A relatively unknown senator before the coup, she sparked controversy when she claimed that Bolivia\u2019s indigenous population, which polls show makes up a large majority of the country, was \u201cSatanic.\u201d Security forces loyal to A\u00f1ez publicly removed and burned the indigenous Wiphala flag patches from their uniforms, a symbolic gesture showing their commitment to the re-establishment of a white supremacist state.\n\nThe A\u00f1ez administration has spent the ensuing nine months silencing dissent, conducting what Murillo himself called a \u201chunting\u201d down of political opponents. This included foreign and alternative media, which were taking off the air, with journalists attacked, arrested, or killed. \u201cThey\u2019re drowning the Bolivian people in blood,\u201d declared deposed vice-president \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Linera from Mexico, where he was granted asylum. Murillo also showed off a new masked, black-clad and armed \u201canti-terror\u201d squad aimed at \u201cforeigners\u201d \u2014 understood as a direct threat to an Argentinian human rights group investigating the killing of a journalist. \u201cWe recommend these foreigners who are arriving\u2026to be careful,\u201dhe said, \u201cWe are looking at you. We are following you,\u201d warning them that there will be \u201czero tolerance\u201d for any \u201cterrorism\u201d or \u201csedition\u201d they enact. \u201cAt the first false move that they make, trying to commit terrorism and sedition, they will have to deal with the police,\u201d he added. The supposedly \u201cinterim\u201d government also went on a privatization drive, reorienting the country\u2019s foreign policy towards the United States, pulling out of multiple international treaties.\n\nThe government has enjoyed the unwavering support of the United States and the Washington-based Organization of American States. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u201ccongratulated\u201d A\u00f1ez on the coup, what he described as, \u201cleading her nation through this democratic transition.\u201d The mainstream press followed suit. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board called the coup a \u201cdemocratic outbreak in Bolivia.\u201d The New York Times\u2019 board were relieved that the \u201cincreasingly dictatorial\u201d Morales had \u201cresigned.\u201d Meanwhile, The Washington Post told its readers that, \u201cthere could be little doubt who was ultimately responsible for the chaos: newly resigned president Evo Morales.\u201d\n\nThere was widespread but relatively disorganized opposition to the coup at the time, with many of the MAS leaders jailed or fleeing abroad to escape arrest, and the new government was able to effectively suppress dissent. However, over time, the opposition became more strident, especially as A\u00f1ez proved to be incapable of stopping a COVID-19 pandemic ripping through the country.\n\nWhen asked what people abroad should do, Vargas responded, \u201cThe message from people here would be that they want the international community and governments around the world to pressure the government to end the paramilitary attacks and to accept a peaceful way for them to leave power, and that is through elections. If the government refuses that then they are pushing the country into more violence.\u201d\n\nFeature photo | Miners wearing face masks amid the COVID-19 pandemic, protest against the postponement of the presidential election in El Alto, Bolivia, Aug. 11, 2020.
