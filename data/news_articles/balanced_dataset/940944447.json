The tenants spent several hours afterwards outside the house, with their belongings and bin bags full of clothes on the pavement.\n\nIn a statement released on Saturday, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na said it was \u201cvery aware of current public discourse\u201d around the incident on Berkeley Road and that as an organisation garda\u00ed must \u201clisten and learn from our experiences\u201d.\n\nThe force is \u201ccommitted to delivering a professional policing and security service with trust, confidence and support\u201d, said the statement.\n\n\u201cOur purpose at events of this type, which are essentially civil legal matters, is not to be an integral part of the event but to prevent breaches of the peace and ensure the safety of all persons involved.\n\n\u201cIn the ever increasingly complex policing environment front-line members of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na must make dynamic and real-time decisions based on the information available to them at any particular time.\n\n\u201cAn Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na management must support frontline members and ensure that they have the correct guidance and support in attending similar developing, dynamic evolving incidents.\u201d\n\nVery concerned\n\nThe Policing Authority said it was very concerned by the material in public circulation relating to the eviction and it welcomed the Garda statement on the matter.\n\n\u201cThat concern was about the appropriateness of the Garda presence and of some of the things that appeared to have been said, and about the fact that circumstances were allowed to develop where the impression was conveyed that the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na had an active role in the event. The impression was also conveyed that the Garda concern for vulnerable people so amply demonstrated in the context of the health emergency was not evident in this case\u201d it said.\n\nIt said the chairperson of the Policing Authority had a number of contacts and conversations with Deputy Commissioner John Twomey about these issues on Thursday and Friday.\n\n\u201cThe statement from the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na is welcome and important in that its recognition that there are lessons to be learned from the incident is an acceptance that all was not right with the garda actions on the day.\n\n\u201cThe Code of Ethics established for the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na by the Policing Authority in 2016 acknowledges that garda\u00ed often have to make on the spot decisions, sometimes with incomplete knowledge of all the facts. It is on the implementation of the learning from these events that attention must now focus,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cPromoting public understanding of policing is a statutory role of the Authority and concern for anything that might lessen public confidence in the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na is central to that. Events that took place in North Frederick Street two years ago should have informed the approach of, and guidance to, Garda members in situations such as arose a few days ago. The Authority will continue its detailed engagement with the Commissioner and his senior colleagues to ensure that everything possible will be done so that the willingness to listen and learn expressed in the Garda statement will bear fruit in policy and practice,\u201d it added.\n\nNotice\n\nOn Thursday, activists with the Dublin Central Housing Action group removed the boarding put up on the house and the tenants re-entered the property. The tenants claim they had not been served written eviction notices to vacate the property prior to it being repossessed on Wednesday.\n\nGerry Ward, who had earlier been the tenants\u2019 landlord, said he had been involved with the property since around 2004. He said there was a legal dispute over it since 2017 with a property fund, Beltany Property Finance.\n\nHe said he had not been aware of the property\u2019s repossession until he was contacted by the tenants.\n\nA spokesman for Goldman Sachs, which controls Beltany, said the fund had sold the property on June 2nd, but was unable to disclose the name of the buyer citing confidentiality reasons.\n\nLandlords\u2019 representative organisation, IPOA, said tenants should not be caught up in disputes between property owners and financial institutions.\n\n\u201cWhile we are aware that difficulties arise in cases where repossession by financial institutions cause friction, the occupiers should not be involved. Legislation should be adhered to,\u201d the association said.\n\n\u201cWhere a dispute arises between property owner and tenant it may be referred to the RTB [Residential Tenancies Board] for resolution in an organised manner.\u201d", "METADATA": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "description": "Policing Authority says it is very concerned by material in circulation relating to eviction", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom14331388"}, "news_keywords": "News, Crime & Law, Gerry Ward, John Twomey, Dublin Central, Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, Ipoa, Landlords, Goldman Sachs Group, Dublin(IE), Phibsborough", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "all", "og": {"title": "Urgent report on Dublin eviction ordered by Deputy Garda Commissioner", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/urgent-report-on-dublin-eviction-ordered-by-deputy-garda-commissioner-1.4331388", "site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "Policing Authority says it is very concerned by material in circulation relating to eviction", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4331386.1597499778!/image/image.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4331386.1597499778!/image/image.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 329, "width": 585}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IrishTimes", "creator": "@SorchaPollak", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/urgent-report-on-dublin-eviction-ordered-by-deputy-garda-commissioner-1.4331388", "title": "Urgent report on Dublin eviction ordered by Deputy Garda Commissioner", "description": "Policing Authority says it is very concerned by material in circulation relating to eviction", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4331386.1597499778!/image/image.jpg", "account_id": 15084853}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "fb": {"pages": 45441411157, "app_id": 1170474839675514}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
