Jung Yeon-je/Pool via REUTERS\n\nMoon was speaking at an anniversary celebration marking the Korean peninsula\u2019s liberation from Japan\u2019s 1910-1945 colonisation.\n\nIn Tokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged never to repeat the tragedy of war.\n\nThe two countries are at loggerheads over a 2018 decision by South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court that ordered a Japanese steelmaker to pay compensation for forced labour during World War Two.\n\nNippon Steel Corp (5401.T) was ordered to pay 100 million won (64,391.8 pounds) each to four South Koreans as compensation.\n\n\u201cWe have been holding discussions with the Japanese government on an amicable solution that the victims can agree on,\u201d said Moon. \u201cThe door for negotiation is still wide open.\u201d\n\nJapan argues the ruling violates international law because all claims for compensation arising from Japan\u2019s colonisation were settled under their 1965 diplomatic treaty.\n\nSeoul says the ruling must be respected as a decision by an independent judiciary.\n\nIn a move widely seen as retaliation for the ruling, Japan last year said it would stop preferential treatment for shipments to South Korea of some key high-tech materials whose production it dominates and which are used by firms such as Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS).\n\nTalks to resolve the export curbs have stalled and South Korea is proceeding with a complaint to the World Trade Organization.\n\nMoon also said inter-Korean cooperation will serve as the best security policy for both the South and North Korea to be \u201cfree from dependence on nuclear and military power.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more solid the cooperation between the two Koreas, the stronger the security of each of the South and the North will be,\u201d said Moon. \u201cThis will serve as an impetus that will lead to prosperity in cooperation with the international community.\u201d", "METADATA": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width,
