Biden: \u201cEvery single American should be wearing a mask when they\u2019re outside for the next three months, at a minimum.[1] Every governor should mandate mandatory mask-wearing.[2]\u201d \u2022 [1] Biden\u2019s advice is outright wrong, in fact dangerous, because it takes no account of aerosol transmission indoors (see the Skagit Valley choir superspreading event, and Japan\u2019s Three C\u2019s). Advising against wearing a mask in a closed space, especially when crowded and in close contact, is actively dangerous. Biden\u2019s pronouncement augers extremely poorly for a competent response to Covid from a Biden Administration. Either Biden\u2019s advisors (e.g., Ronald Klain) aren\u2019t, er, listening to the science, or Biden isn\u2019t listening to them. [2] Biden advocates simple federalism (in essence, subsidiarity) but in no way different from what Trump is doing. Biden (D)(2): \u201c\u2018The President Was Not Encouraging\u2019: What Obama Really Thought About Biden\u201d [Politico]. \u201cBut behind all the BFF bonhomie is a much more complicated story\u2014one fueled by the misgivings the 44th president had about the would-be 46th, the deep hurt still felt among Biden\u2019s allies over how Obama embraced Hillary Clinton as his successor, and a powerful sense of pride that is driving Biden to prove that the former president and many of his aides underestimated the very real strengths of his partner.\u201d \u2022 A bit soap opera-esque, but interesting. Biden (D)(3): \u201cThe Kamala Harris identity debate shows how America still struggles to talk about multiracial people\u201d [Vox]. \u201cFor multiracial people, defining their racial identity in America is a complex and fraught issue. And what the energy expended on debating Harris\u2019s identity tells us is that we still have a long way to go when it comes to talking about multiracial people in America.\u201d \u2022 Sure, whatever. The issue isn\u2019t America, or even Harris, does or does not do. The issue is what the Democrat Party does. In the argot of the political class \u2014 party apparatchiks, the press, public intellectuals, the NGOs \u2014 identities are mutually exclusive siloes. I mean, the slogan is \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d It isn\u2019t \u201cPeople of Color Matter,\u201d let alone \u201cBlack and/or South Asian Lives Matter.\u201d The first slogan goes down with the political class so well because it dovetails neatly with their worldview. Note this is a semantic argument purely; personally, I\u2019m happy that Harris has a cosmopolitan ancestry; it\u2019s rich and interesting. But that\u2019s not how Democrat identity politics is framed. So it\u2019s interesting to watch them try to wriggle out of the ideological trap they built for themselves and then happily climbed into. Biden (D)(4): \u201cYes, Kamala Harris Is Eligible For Vice President\u201d [Jonathan Turley]. \u201cBirthright citizenship has been a subject of debate from the time that the 14th Amendment was adopted. There are arguments on both sides of the currently accepted broad interpretation of the language. Many of our closest allies reject the concept of birthright citizenship. However, the case law is strongly supports Harris. In 1898, in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the court found that the child of Chinese immigrants was still a citizen under the 14th Amendment because he was born on U.S. territory. His parents were here legally as permanent residents. Moreover, the language of the 14th Amendment does not clearly support the exclusions raised by Eastman. It states \u2018All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\u2019 Most reading that language have concluded that it allows for birthright citizenship for anyone \u2018born \u2026 in the United States.\u2019 The 14th Amendment starts and ends as a model of clarity, stating that \u2018all persons born or naturalized in the United States\u201d are \u201ccitizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\u2019 But between those two phrases, Congress inserted the words \u2018and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u2019 Those six words have perplexed scholars for 150 years. The dominant view of law professors is the line as a whole guarantees that anyone born within the United States becomes an American citizen. But some believe that the caveat means you must be here in a legal status, that if you are not a American citizen, then you are a legal resident. Biden (D)(5): \u201cSome Questions for Kamala Harris About Eligibility\u201d [John Eastman, Newsweek]. \u201cThe language of Article II is that one must be a natural-born citizen. The original Constitution did not define citizenship, but the 14th Amendment does\u2014and it provides that \u2018all persons born\u2026in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens.\u2019 Those who claim that birth alone is sufficient overlook the second phrase. The person must also be \u2018subject to the jurisdiction\u2019 of the United States, and that meant subject to the complete jurisdiction, not merely a partial jurisdiction such as that which applies to anyone temporarily sojourning in the United States (whether lawfully or unlawfully).\u201d \u2022 I think anybody who\u2019s stayed in a foreign country for any length of time, especially as a resident or expat, knows that they are \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof,\u201d and it doesn\u2019t matter much whether it\u2019s partial or not. Can the foreign country put you in jail? Tax you? Heck, yeah! Eastman\u2019s strained reading defies common sense. Biden (D)(6): \u201cWhat Kamala Harris Means For Joe Biden\u2019s Campaign\u2014and the Democratic Party\u2019s Future\u201d [Time]. \u201c[Biden] all but anointed an heir, positioning Harris as the future standard bearer of a party in transition\u2026. More than most would-be presidents, Biden was choosing not just a governing partner, but the woman who would lead the Democratic Party into the future.\u201d \u2022 In other words, machine politics? The Chicago Way? Biden (D)(7): \u201cLeft wing rankled by choice of Harris for VP\u201d [Politico]. \u201cAlready, Harris is being described by pundits as the frontrunner in the next open Democratic primary, whether it\u2019s in 2024 or 2028. Progressives said that means they could be locked out of the White House for more than a decade. \u201c\u2018We might be looking at 12 years of neoliberal power at the top of the Democratic Party because of the specter of a very young and ambitious \u2014 as most politicians are \u2014 person on the ticket,\u2019 said Norman Solomon, co-founder of the left-wing group RootsAction.org. \u2018That\u2019s a real fear.'\u201d Biden (D)(7): \u201cBiden Campaign Gets Kamala Harris Quickly Up To Speed On Candidate\u2019s Plans For Presidential Funeral Service\u201d [The Onion]. \u201c\u2018Here are the Bible verses I want to have read, along with a seating chart. We\u2019re still hashing out the list of speakers, but we\u2019ll definitely have you, Barack, and Jill offer remarks, and then we\u2019ll end the ceremony with the orchestra playing \u2018Danny Boy.'\u201d Biden (D)(8): \u201cBiden Vows To Return Nation To Era When Press Didn\u2019t Bother Reporting On President\u2019s Scandals\u201d [Babylon Bee].

Furthermore, there are some reasons to think the election will tighten, and President Trump is likely to have an advantage in a close election because of the Electoral College.\u201d \u2022 Many imponderables, including (as I have been saying) a (colorable) vaccine, an economic rebound, and (as we have seen today with the UAE/Israel deal) a foreign policy triumph. And then, of course, shenanigans. 81 days is a long time in politics! Trump (R)(2): \u201cTrump: \u2018A lot of people\u2019 think Edward Snowden \u2018not being treated fairly'\u201d [New York Post]. \u201cPresident Trump polled his aides on Thursday about whether he should let anti-surveillance whistleblower and leaker Edward Snowden return to the US from Russia without going to prison, saying he was open to it. \u2018There are a lot of people that think that he is not being treated fairly. I mean, I hear that,\u2019 Trump told The Post in an exclusive interview in the Oval Office, before soliciting views from his staff.\u201d Trump (R)(3): \u201cTrump\u2019s Surrogates Are Campaigning Across The US In Luxury Buses In A Bid For Suburban Women\u201d [Buzzfeed]. \u201cGoodbye, stadium-sized rallies (for now). There\u2019s a pandemic, and the president just isn\u2019t into half-filled venues where people are forced to social-distance because of the coronavirus\u2026. Instead, the president\u2019s son Eric Trump and his daughter-in-law Lara Trump are leading their own crusade of surrogates on nationwide tours in big luxury buses \u2014 one red, the other pink\u2026. The event brought more than 100 people to Salfordville, a small township in southeast Pennsylvania where \u2018nothing ever happens,\u2019 according to Greg Wagner, a Trump supporter who lives nearby and told BuzzFeed News, \u2018This is the biggest thing ever.'\u201d \u2022 Oddly, this reminds me very much of the retooled Clinton campaign in 2008 (after Obama was said to have wrapped it up with early wins). The Clintons (both of them) barnstormed small venues with SMS-driven tech (working class people have complex schedules). They ended up winning the popular vote, albeit by a small margin. There are votes in towns where \u201cnothing ever happens.\u201d West (I)(1): \u201cWhy Kanye\u2019s Presidential Platform Is Good News\u201d [The American Conservative]. \u201cBy contrast, West\u2019s platform is clear, concise, and meant to be read\u2014or, who knows, maybe rapped. In fact, because it\u2019s so brief, in its ten, er, commandments, it\u2019s worth seeing in its entirety. And as we can see, in addition to mostly center-right prescriptions about personal values and societal verities\u2014each one anchored in a Bible verse\u2014the West platform includes, in points 4 and 8, very specific adjurations against \u201cforeign quagmires\u201d and military \u2018aggression.\u2019\u2026 The point here is not to argue that West should be president. After all, a man who calls his political party \u201cThe Birthday Party\u201d might be judged as lacking, shall we say, the requisite seriousness for the post\u2026. Yet if we ease up on the political calculations, we might step back and admire the cultural and social artistry of West, a man who pledges a kinder and gentler America\u2026 He\u2019s a man, also, who speaks in language that crosses racial lines\u2014indeed, a man whose very own family (he is married to Kim Kardashian) transcends racial categories.\u201d * * * PA: \u201cTrump-Appointed Judge Demands Evidence of Mail-in Voting Fraud\u201d [Bloomberg]. \u201cThe Trump campaign and Republican National Committee sued Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar and local election boards on June 29 over their plan for mail-in balloting for the November 3 elections. Trump\u2019s team claimed the plan \u2018provides fraudsters an easy opportunity to engage in ballot harvesting, manipulate or destroy ballots, manufacture duplicitous votes, and sow chaos.\u2019 U.S. District Judge J. Nicholas Ranjan in Pittsburgh on Thursday asked the campaign to put forward previous examples of such fraud. \u2018Plaintiffs shall produce such evidence in their possession, and if they have none, state as much,\u2019 said Ranjan, who took his seat on the bench in August 2019. He gave the campaign until Friday.\u201d PA: \u201cUSPS says Pennsylvania mail ballots may not be delivered on time, and state warns of \u2018overwhelming\u2019 risk to voters\u201d [Philadelphia Inquirer]. \u201cThe U.S. Postal Service has warned Pennsylvania that some mail ballots might not be delivered on time because the state\u2019s deadlines are too tight for its \u2018delivery standards,\u2019 prompting election officials to ask the state Supreme Court to extend the deadlines to avoid disenfranchising voters. The warning came in a July 29 letter from Thomas J. Marshall, general counsel and executive vice president of the Postal Service, to Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, whose department oversees elections. That letter was made public late Thursday in a filing her Department of State submitted to the Supreme Court, asking it to order that mail ballots be counted as long as they are received up to three days after the Nov. 3 election date.\u201d\n\nRussiaGate\n\n\u201cEx-FBI lawyer, accused of falsifying document in probe of Trump\u2019s campaign, to plead guilty\u201d [WaPo]. \u201cA former FBI lawyer has agreed to plead guilty to altering an email that helped justify surveillance of a former Trump campaign adviser as part of the 2016 investigation into Russian interference in the election, according to his lawyer and a person familiar with the matter. Kevin Clinesmith, who worked in the FBI general counsel\u2019s office, is expected to admit he doctored an email so it said that former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was not a source for the CIA, even though Page had had a relationship with the agency. Relying on what Clinesmith had said, the FBI ultimately did not disclose Page\u2019s relationship with the CIA as it applied to renew a warrant to monitor him as a possible agent of a foreign power. The case is the first against someone involved in the Russia probe brought by U.S. Attorney John Durham, who was specially tapped by Attorney General William P. Barr to broadly look into how the FBI handled that matter.\u201d \u2022 This time we\u2019ve got him! Oh, wait\u2026\n\nRealignment and Legitimacy\n\n\u201cHe set out to mobilize Latino voters. Then the virus hit\u201d [Associated Press]. Across the U.S., the coronavirus outbreak is disrupting Latinos\u2019 long and difficult climb up the political ladder. The disease has disproportionately sickened Latinos, destabilized communities and impeded voter registration ahead of the November presidential election. In North Carolina, only 5,000 Latinos have been added to the voter rolls since mid-March, less than half the number added during the same period four years ago. The virus and the economic fallout it triggered is crashing down on Latinos just as they hit an electoral milestone. For the first time, there will be more Latinos eligible to vote than any other minority group \u2014 32 million, the Pew Research Center projects.\u201d \u201cMorse cites link between allegations, state party volunteer\u201d [Berkshire Eagle]. \u201c\u2018I think evidence will soon show that it was even an attorney for the Massachusetts Democratic Party that, in fact, drafted the email to me on [Aug. 6] that was then printed, word for word, in the Daily Collegian in the first place,\u2019 Morse said in an interview with The Eagle\u2019s editorial board Thursday\u2026. In his interview, Morse said he believes the allegations put forward by the College Democrats, first published Aug. 7 in an unbylined story in the Massachusetts Daily Collegian, helped spur not only national media interest, but the largest single-day of fundraising in his candidacy. \u2018We\u2019ve had the best fundraising week of the entire campaign, since Friday. [Wednesday] alone, we raised $130,000 from over 3,000 individual contributions. In one day. Our previous high day was $27,000,\u2019 Morse said.\u201d \u2022 That the story was unbylined is a really interesting detail. \u201cThomas Frank on Anti-Populism, Plus Biden\u2019s Most-Stoned Moment Ever\u201d (podcast) [Useful Idiots]. \u2022 Well worth a listen. Thomas Frank book tours are always exciting! * * * \u201cWhat Really Scares Voting Experts About the Postal Service\u201d [The Atlantic]. \u201cFrom a sheer numbers perspective, none of the experts I spoke with doubted that the Postal Service could handle a vote-by-mail election, even if every one of the nation\u2019s more than 150 million registered voters stuck their ballot in a mailbox. As one noted to me, a presidential election might be a big deal, but in postal terms, it\u2019s no Christmas. The Postal Service processes nearly 500 million pieces of mail every day, and it annually handles more than 3 billion pieces in the week before Christmas alone. \u201cI don\u2019t worry about their capacity,\u201d Amber McReynolds, the former director of elections in Denver, who now runs the National Vote at Home Institute, a mail-balloting advocacy group, told me.\u201d \u2022 However, capacity can be throttled, which is what DeJoy appears to be doing. Nevertheless, this can\u2019t be a real problem, because otherwise Democrats would not have left on vacay without doing something about it. The article goes into a lot of detail and is well worth a read. Saying the quiet part out loud: So\u2026UPS\u2026Fedex\u2026big opportunity here.

The commission admonished Election Systems & Software over promotional literature and statements on its website that appear to assert, falsely, that voting machines the company sells with embedded modems have been sanctioned by the EAC under its testing and certification program\u2026. This isn\u2019t the first time ES&S has faced accusations of making fabricated or misleading assertions about its voting machines.ES&S will play a major role in the November election. The company has previously said that more than 33,000 DS200 optical scan machines with modems are in use in 11 states and the District of Columbia but has never identified which jurisdictions this includes beyond D.C.\u201d \u2022 [puts head in hands].\n\nStats Watch\n\nAt reader request, I added some business stats back in.

But: \u201cDoing a productivity analysis during a major recession is a waste of time as productivity should crater especially since the government has paid business not to layoff staff.\u201d\n\nConsumer Sentiment: \u201cPreliminary August 2020 Michigan Consumer Sentiment Marginally Improves\u201d [Econintersect]. \u201cSurveys of Consumers chief economist, Richard Curtin, makes the following comments: Consumer sentiment remained largely unchanged in early August from the July reading (+0.3 points) or the April low (+1.0). Two significant changes since April have been that consumers have become more pessimistic about the five-year economic outlook (-18 points) and more optimistic about buying conditions (+21)\u2026. he overall confidence in economic policies fell to the lowest level since Trump first entered office (see the chart). The policy gridlock has acted to increase uncertainty and heightened the need for precautionary funds to offset lapses in economic relief programs and to hedge against fears about the persistence and spread of the coronavirus as the school year gets underway. Bad economic times are anticipated to persist not only during the year ahead, but the majority of consumers expect no return to a period of uninterrupted growth over the next five years.\u201d \u2022 So long, aggregate demand\u2026\n\nConsumer Confidence: \u201cAnalysis: Impact of Executive Orders on Consumer Confidence Unlikely to Boost Spending\u201d [Morning Consult]. \u201cConsumer confidence remains steady in the wake of stalled negotiations in Congress and executive orders from the White House. Morning Consult\u2019s Index of Consumer Sentiment reads 86.71 as of Wednesday, unchanged from 30 days prior. The relative stability of consumer confidence in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders indicates that the economic impact of the funds will be proportionate to the total value of the government spending, without an additional boost from increased consumer confidence. The same was essentially true when the CARES Act was signed into law. Differences between consumer and investor confidence are likely to persist given their different reactions to the spread of the coronavirus, meaning that recent gains in the stock market are unlikely to translate into increases in consumer confidence or spending as they did prior to the onset of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nInventories: \u201cJune 2020 Business Inventories Decline Again\u201d [Econintersect]. \u201cHeadlines say final business sales data (retail plus wholesale plus manufacturing) improved month-over-month.

The forecasters predict the economy will expand at an annual rate of 19.1 percent this quarter , much stronger than the prediction of 10.6 percent from the last survey. On an annual-average over annual-average basis, the forecasters expect real GDP to decrease 5.2 percent this year but to recover and grow at an annual rate of between 2.2 percent to 3.5 percent over each of the following three years.\u201d \u2022 19.1% would certainly gave Trump a bit of a tailwind. But is it realistic, if a school re-opening debacle takes place?\n\n* * *\n\nCommodities: \u201c\u2018Stranded Assets\u2019 Risk Rising With Climate Action and $40 Oil\u201d [Bloomberg]. \u201cWhen you see a half-constructed building that\u2019s been abandoned, it\u2019s a sign the project no longer made economic sense. There\u2019s an argument that trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of investments to tap new supplies of oil and gas might suffer the same fate, leaving deposits of oil in the ground and turning them into what are known as \u201cstranded assets.\u201d What had seemed like an abstract debate has been made very real by the sharp drop in oil prices in 2020, leading some major companies to shift plans away from fields where drilling is costlier or whose deposits are more carbon intensive.\u201d \u2022 That\u2019s a damn shame.\n\nCommodities: \u201cU.S. energy supply chains may be in for more upheaval as oil refiners reconsider the direction of their business. Phillips 66 plans to transform a San Francisco-area oil refinery into a plant that produces a biofuel known as renewable diesel\u2026 one of several such projects in the pipeline as big U.S. refiners weigh their operations against reduced demand for fossil fuels and tightening environmental regulations\u201d [Wall Street Journal]. \u201cMany expect global oil consumption to remain depressed for years, but the appetite for renewable fuel is likely to grow amid laws aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One firm projects that U.S. renewable-diesel consumption will roughly double over the next decade to around 1.1 billion gallons a year.\u201d\n\nShipping: \u201cCommentary: 20-foot container crunch may impact harvests\u201d [American Shipper]. \u201cThe U.S. agriculture industry has faced numerous headwinds during the COVID-19 pandemic, and with harvests just around the corner, there is a trend developing that could impact the availability of the industry\u2019s desired 20-foot containers\u2026. Containership lines\u2019 blank sailings over the past few months sparked a strategy for importers to favor 40-foot containers instead of 20-foot boxes. This was an effort to import as much product as possible given the limited shipping space available. As result, the supply of 20-foot containers has been constrained. Therefore, this has increased the price of 20-foot equipment, making it even less desirable to use. As a result, there is fear of an impending 20-foot container shortage\u2026. Agriculture products like soybeans on the other hand, are heavier, of lower value, and have tighter margins. They also require blocking structures to secure the load from shifting during transit. These structures are heavy and add to a load\u2019s overall weight. With weight limits applied to trucks, using a 40-foot container might not make financial sense for the agricultural exporter. It all depends on the shipping rate.\u201d\n\nApparel: \u201cApparel companies are undertaking a balancing act with their big stockpiles of unsold goods. Merchants from elite fashion houses to mass-market chains are saddled with an inventory glut following monthslong closures during the pandemic\u2026 and now they are looking for ways to get rid of the excess without angering waste-conscious consumers or harming their brands. \u201d [Wall Street Journal]. \u201cIn France, the government this year even barred companies from destroying unsold, usable goods. The European Union has proposed a similar ban for the entire 27-nation bloc. That has left companies with more clothing, and many are turning to charities as an inventory outlet. U.S. nonprofit Good360 expects more than $660 million in donations this year, double what it received last year.\u201d\n\nTech: \u201cGoogle tests new profile cards that let you add yourself to search results\u201d [The Verge]. \u201cGoogle is testing a new user-created public profile system called \u201cpeople cards,\u201d which will let users create their own profile (including their job, links to their social media platforms, a brief bio, and more) that will appear directly in Google search results. It\u2019s similar to how celebrities and businesses already appear. The new cards are only being tested in India in English to start.\u201d \u2022 Here am I!

The consensus that emerged on both sides of the aisle dictated that no matter what happened, Americans ought to be glad they do not live in a country with socialized medicine\u2026. [N]ow, just a few months later, these arguments completely and utterly fail. New infections are still surging in the U.S. while countries with national health care programs have long since gotten a handle on the virus. On Tuesday, the U.S. reported more new COVID cases in a single day than Italy, France, and the U.K. reported last month combined, and roughly 45 percent of their total deaths.\u201d \u2022 Not to mention Taiwan (single payer), South Korea (universal, partial single payer), Vietnam (socialist), and Thailand (universal, partial single payer).\n\n\u201cThe Plan That Could Give Us Our Lives Back\u201d [The Atlantic]. \u201cMichael mina is a professor of epidemiology at Harvard, where he studies the diagnostic testing of infectious diseases. He has watched, with disgust and disbelief, as the United States has struggled for months to obtain enough tests to fight the coronavirus. In January, he assured a newspaper reporter that he had \u201cabsolute faith\u201d in the ability of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to contain the virus. By early March, that conviction was in crisis. \u201cThe incompetence has really exceeded what anyone would expect,\u201d he told The New York Times. His astonishment has only intensified since. Many Americans may understand that testing has failed in this country\u2014that it has been inadequate, in one form or another, since February. What they may not understand is that it is failing, now. In each of the past two weeks, and for the first time since the pandemic began, the country performed fewer COVID-19 tests than it did in the week prior. The system is deteriorating\u2026. Why has testing failed so completely? By the end of March, Mina had identified a culprit: \u2018There\u2019s little ability for a central command unit to pool all the resources from around the country,\u2019 he said at a Harvard event. \u2018We have no way to centralize things in this country short of declaring martial law.'\u201d \u2022 I can imagine the screaming if Trump did that! The solution: Rapid testing. The whole article is well worth a read!\n\nI should react to this in horror:\n\nBut I would kinda like a mask like that. (In fact, I\u2019m imagining a clear plastic, astronaut-style helmet!)\n\nBlack Injustice Tipping Point\n\n\u201cGetting killed by police is a leading cause of death for young black men in America\u201d [Los Angeles Times]. \u201cAbout 1 in 1,000 black men and boys in America can expect to die at the hands of police, according to a new analysis of deaths involving law enforcement officers. That makes them 2.5 times more likely than white men and boys to die during an encounter with cops.\u201d\n\nThe Biosphere\n\nGames\n\n\u201cApple just kicked Fortnite off the App Store\u201d [The Verge]. \u201cApple has removed Epic Games\u2019 battle royale game Fortnite from the App Store after the developer on Thursday implemented its own in-app payment system that bypassed Apple\u2019s standard 30 percent fee. The decision marks a significant escalation in the feud between Epic and one of the world\u2019s most dominant mobile software marketplaces. It also comes at an especially fraught time for Apple as the iPhone maker navigates antitrust concerns over its operation of the App Store and the rules it imposes on certain developers.Following the removal, Epic revealed a carefully calculated series of responses, including an antitrust lawsuit seeking to establish Apple\u2019s App Store as a monopoly and a protest video that aired on YouTube and within Fortnite itself mocking the iPhone maker\u2019s iconic \u20181984\u2019 ad and calling on gaming fans to #FreeFortnite by supporting its fight against Apple.\u201d\n\nClass Warfare\n\nNot bugs.

He explains that after 17 to 19 hours of fasting from noon to the dawn of the next day, it\u2019s believed the practitioner\u2019s mind, as well as palate, gets cleansed and purified, which is deemed to be a crucial step in the path to achieving spiritual perfection. With benevolence and compassion at the heart of Buddhism, fasting is considered the only way to viscerally feel the pain and agony of the starved and poor. While this was a strict rule that all Buddhists adhered to in the past, it is changing as peoples\u2019 lifestyles evolve. Buddhism holds that nothing on Earth is fixed, and that nature should be allowed to take its course. While most Buddhist followers today eat dinner, they tend to have an early and light one, Hui says.\u201d \u2022 My eating schedule is 180\u00b0 different. Perhaps I should change!\n\nNot Frank Gehry:\n\n\u201cWhy Our Pets Have Become Super Needy During the Pandemic\u201d [Bloomberg]. \u201cProblem No. 1: Your pet is overstimulated. \u2018Owners never leave,\u2019 Miller says. \u2018The dog isn\u2019t given any downtime.

The web and web browsers have become Lovecraftian horrors of an unprecedented scale. They\u2019ve long since left \u2018scope creep\u2019 territory and entered \u2018oh my god please just stop\u2019 territory, and are trucking on through to hitherto unexplored degrees of obscene scope. And we don\u2019t want what they\u2019re selling. Google pitches garbage like AMP and pushing dubious half-assed specs like Web Components. Mozilla just fired everyone relevant to focus on crap no one asked for like Pocket, and fad nonsense like a paid VPN service and virtual reality tech. [2020-08-14: It has been pointed out that the VR team was also fired.] Microsoft gave up entirely. Mozilla just hammered the last few nails into their casket. Safari is a joke. Google is all that\u2019s left, and they\u2019re not a good steward of the open web. The browsers are drowning under their own scope. The web is dead. I call for an immediate and indefinite suspension of the addition of new developer-facing APIs to web browsers. Browser vendors need to start thinking about reducing scope and cutting features.\u201d \u2022 Obviously, everybody should use apps, and URLs should be completely hidden away.\n\n\u201cThe Linux-based PinePhone is the most interesting smartphone I\u2019ve tried in years\u201d [Android Police]. \u2022 A phone with hardware you can replace (batteries, e.g.) and open source software (17 flavors of Linux).
