Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed and US President Donald Trump hailed the agreement as \"historic,\" while the Palestinians and some countries including Iran and Turkey decried it as a \"betrayal.\"\n\nIn a telephone call, the Bahraini monarch described the UAE-Israeli pact as a \"historic step for peace,\" saying it will boost peace efforts and stability in the Middle East, according to the agency. King Hamad also said the deal preserves a two-state formula that envisages a Palestinian state alongside Israel.\n\nOn Thursday, Bahrain was the first in a six-nation energy-rich Gulf bloc allied with the US to hail the deal. Bahrain is home to the US 5th Fleet.\n\nAt a White House press briefing on Thursday, officials said that Oman and Bahrain would be the next countries to normalize relations with Israel.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "fb": {"pages": 82903654348, "app_id": 287530407927859}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#0B7EB5", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/hdc/images/mstile-144x144.png", "referrer": "always", "robots": "noarchive", "isPremiumContent": "false", "article": {"content_tier": "free", "published": "2020-08-15T08:50:00.000Z"}, "og": {"site_name": "Haaretz.com", "title": "King of Bahrain congratulates the UAE on deal with Israel", "description": "***", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/king-of-bahrain-congratulates-mbz-on-deal-with-israel-1.9074555", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.haarets.co.il/image/fetch/x_0,y_4,w_2065,h_1191,c_crop/q_auto,h_698,w_1200,c_fill,f_auto/fl_lossy.any_format.preserve_transparency.progressive:none/https://www.haaretz.co.il/polopoly_fs/1.5683260!/image/1018316866.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "title": "King of Bahrain congratulates the UAE on deal with Israel - Middle East News", "description": "Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa described the agreement as a 'historic step for peace,' and according to the White House is next to normalize relations with Israel", "keywords": "United Arab Emirates,  Annexation", "ob": {"title": "King of Bahrain congratulates the UAE on deal with Israel"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@haaretzcom", "title": "King of Bahrain congratulates the UAE on deal with Israel", "description": "***", "image": "https://images.haarets.co.il/image/fetch/x_0,y_4,w_2065,h_1191,c_crop/q_auto,h_698,w_1200,c_fill,f_auto/fl_lossy.any_format.preserve_transparency.progressive:none/https://www.haaretz.co.il/polopoly_fs/1.5683260!/image/1018316866.jpg"}, "next-head-count": 22}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
