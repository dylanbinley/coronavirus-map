Neither I nor our law enforcement partners could ever allow that to stand,\u201d said State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle. \u201cThe victim deserved so much more. I am grateful for the diligence and commitment of my prosecutors and staff in the Extradition Section of the Legal Unit of the Miami Dade State Attorney\u2019s Office, the commitment of the Coral Gables Police Department, the United States Marshals Service, the Department of Justice Office of International Affairs and Panamanian Law Enforcement for their unwillingness to allow Orozco to remain free with a pending rape charge. This criminal case will finally be resolved in a courtroom.\u201d\n\nHis deportation came less than two weeks after his arrest.\n\nHowever, he is now back in custody in Miami-Dade County, where he will stand trial on the sexual assault charge.", "METADATA": {"civicscience": {"jspoll-hostname": "www138.civicscience.com"}, "application-name": "Accused Rapist Deported By ICE 13 Days Before Trial Is Back In Miami-Dade County", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "Crime", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "A man charged with sexual assault, who was deported by ICE before he could be put on trial, is now back in Miami-Dade County.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
