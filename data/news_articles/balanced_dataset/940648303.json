By contrast, Trump said in a recent interview with Axios that he never confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin about the matter.\n\nThe New York Times first reported in June about the existence of a CIA assessment that Russian operatives had secretly offered and paid bounties to militants to incentivize more frequent attacks on American and coalition troops in Afghanistan in the months leading up to the historic peace agreement announced in February. The White House claimed that Trump was briefed on the intelligence, but the president has dismissed the reports as a \"Russian hoax.\"\n\nAsked about Trump's remarks in the Axios interview, Pompeo declined to comment on whether the president was briefed or not, and defended Trump's handling of the situation.\n\n\"President Trump has in every case that any one of his national security team has come to him to say, 'Sir, we\u2019ve got a concern we\u2019re not doing enough here, we can do more here, here\u2019s another risk,' the president has taken that on board seriously and we have responded in a way that is not only completely appropriate, but it\u2019s kept our people safe,\" Pompeo said.\n\nThe top U.S. general in the Middle East told reporters that he's skeptical over the intelligence that bounties had been paid.\n\n\"I found it very worrisome. I didn\u2019t find that there was a causative link there,\" Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said in early July.", "METADATA": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "og": {"title": "Pompeo, Pentagon warned Russia against offering bounties for killing U.S. troops", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/13/pompeo-russia-bounties-us-troops-395084", "description": "President Donald Trump dismissed reports of the payments as a \"hoax.\"", "image": "https://static.politico.com/71/08/1f77f032468998db7e64cc9c3b97/gettyimages-1227719779-1.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "site_name": "POLITICO"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#dc0228", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "twitter": {"title": "Pompeo, Pentagon warned Russia against offering bounties for killing U.S. troops", "image": "https://static.politico.com/71/08/1f77f032468998db7e64cc9c3b97/gettyimages-1227719779-1.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@politico", "creator": "@politico"}, "host": "www.politico.com", "build": "2020-08-10T19:55:35Z"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
