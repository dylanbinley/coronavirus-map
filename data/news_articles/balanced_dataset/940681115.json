This is the second such whip to the MLAs and came just a day ahead of the session of the Assembly on August 14.\n\n\"All six MLAs have been directed under para 2(1)(a) of the Xth Schedule to vote against the Congress Party in any No-Confidence motion or any other proceedings to be held during the Assembly session of Rajasthan Assembly and if they violate the same they will face disqualification under para 2(1)(b) of the Xth Schedule,\" a press note by BSP stated.\n\nOn Thursday, the Supreme Court declined to stay a September 2019 decision by Rajasthan Assembly Speaker CP Joshi allowing the merger of six BSP MLAs with the Congress party. The decision came as a boost for the Gehlot government, which, now with the return of Sachin Pilot camp, may not require the support of BSP MLAs to prove a majority in the House.\n\nBJP to bring a no-confidence motion\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies will be bringing in a no-confidence motion on Friday. The political turmoil in Rajasthan, which began after the political differences between former deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot and Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot surfaced, ended early this week after Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi assured Pilot to constitute a three-member committee to address the grievances raised by him.\n\nPilot was removed as deputy CM and expelled from party posts last month after he and 18 MLAs skipped Congress Legislative Party (CLP) meetings last month. While Gehlot blamed the BJP alleging horsetrading, he vehemently stated that his government had the required numbers to prove a majority in the House.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/mayawatis-bsp-issues-whip-to-six-rajasthan-mlas-to-vote-against-congress-in-assembly/636738", "type": "Article", "title": "Mayawati's BSP issues whip to six Rajasthan MLAs to vote against Congress in Assembly", "description": "The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on Thursday issued a whip for the second time to six of its MLAs in Rajasthan to vote against the Congress in any no-confidence motion or any other proceedings in state Assembly.", "image": "https://imgk.timesnownews.com/story/Ashok_Gehlot_Rajasthan_PTI.jpg?tr=w-560,h-292,fo-top"}, "description": "The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on Thursday issued a whip for the second time to six of its MLAs in Rajasthan to vote against the Congress in any no-confidence motion or any other proceedings in state Assembly.", "news_keywords": "Rajasthan, Rajasthan politics, Rajasthan latest news, BSP MLAS Rajasthan, Rajasthan Assembly session, Mayawati", "keywords": "Rajasthan, Rajasthan politics, Rajasthan latest news, BSP MLAS Rajasthan, Rajasthan Assembly session, Mayawati", "fb": {"app_id": 2051731518430427, "pages": 218735715310}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mayawati's BSP issues whip to six Rajasthan MLAs to vote against Congress in Assembly", "description": "The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on Thursday issued a whip for the second time to six of its MLAs in Rajasthan to vote against the Congress in any no-confidence motion or any other proceedings in state Assembly.", "image": "https://imgk.timesnownews.com/story/Ashok_Gehlot_Rajasthan_PTI.jpg", "site": "@TIMESNOW", "creator": "@TIMESNOW"}, "theme-color": "#254A96", "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}}}
