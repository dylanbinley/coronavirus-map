However, in Kabul, the two camps within the Afghan government have so far failed to complete the structure and membership of the High Council for National Reconciliation.\n\n\u201cThere is only one area of dispute and that is the president wants Mustafa Mastoor to take the charge of an economic sector, but he has been appointed as State Minister on Peace Affairs,\u201d said Faraidoon Khawzon, a spokesman for Abdullah.\n\n\u201cPractically it can be seen that Dr. Abdullah is unwilling to fulfill his obligations under the agreement. The peace process has reached a serious stage and there are questions about the structure of the High Council of National Reconciliation,\u201d said legal expert Arash Shahirpour.\n\nThe Presidential Palace has said that the appointment of members of the High Council of National Reconciliation was the responsibility of Abdullah Abdullah and that the State Ministry on Peace Affairs will also operate under the structure of the High Council of National Reconciliation.\n\nAfghan citizens have said that a continued clash between the Afghan political leaders will jeopardize the peace process with the Taliban.\n\n\u201cThe people are tired of the war, they want peace,\u201d said Omar Shah, a resident in Kabul.\n\n\u201cThey must put their personal differences aside and work on the structure of the cabinet,\u201d said Geti, a resident in Kabul.\n\nOn May 17, President Ashraf Ghani and his political rival Abdullah Abdullah signed a power-sharing deal after months of political discord that critics say could have pushed the country towards a new crisis if not resolved.\n\nThe political tension emerged as a consequence of the disputed presidential election of last year, the result of which was announced in February. As a result, the two leaders, Ghani and Abdullah, held inauguration ceremonies on the same day in their adjacent palaces. Ghani was declared president by the Independent Election Commission after earning a slightly higher percentage than his rival Abdullah.", "METADATA": {"title": "Ghani, Abdullah Camps Still Divided on Cabinet Appointments | TOLOnews", "description": "There is a disagreement between the Presidential Palace and Sapidar Palace on the appointment of Mustafa Mastoor, with Abdullah Abdullah's team wanting to nominate Mastoor as Stat", "referrer": "origin", "og": {"description": "Presidential Palace has said that the appointment of members of the High Council of National Reconciliation was the responsibility of Abdullah Abdullah.", "image": "https://tolonews.com/sites/default/files/1_577.jpg", "site_name": "TOLOnews", "title": "Ghani, Abdullah Camps Still Divided on Cabinet Appointments | TOLOnews", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There is a disagreement between the Presidential Palace and Sapidar Palace on the appointment of Mustafa Mastoor, with Abdullah Abdullah's team wanting to nominate Mastoor as Stat", "image": "https://tolonews.com/sites/default/files/1_577.jpg", "url": "https://tolonews.com/afghanistan/ghani-abdullah-camps-still-divided-cabinet-appointments", "site": "@TOLOnews", "title": "Ghani, Abdullah Camps Still Divided on Cabinet Appointments", "card": "summary"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "fb": {"pages": 187202271320522}}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
