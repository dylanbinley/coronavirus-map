Saturday deadline. Eurostar trains between Paris and London and airport lounges that were almost empty earlier in the coronavirus pandemic filled with passengers. Those with more means opted for private jets.\n\nThe exodus was prompted by the British government's decision late Thursday to take France off a list of nations exempt from traveller quarantine requirements because of a sharp rise there in new virus infections. For those who cannot work from home on their return, the mandatory self-quarantine could see them penalized financially.\n\nThe UK move has the potential to upend the plans of those planning trips in the days ahead, particularly of families during the run-up to schools reopening in September. French businesses running campsites in Brittany, wine-tasting tours in the Loire Valley or mountain treks in the Alps also have reason to worry.\n\nThe French government has indicated it will respond in kind to Britain's decision, further hobbling travel and tourism at a time when the industry is trying to recover from the economic shock of the pandemic.", "METADATA": {"alexaVerifyID": "rSmiGOPEjbvIe54g6VDdjp7fxDQ", "google-site-verification": "yGWL0JARPWTYZuQO6SyybESnW5Tn5sn_mj5vRQhwZq8", "y_key": "b1206159d404874b", "msvalidate.01": "F356DE1E2BCA8CFA747B5120592BE455", "description": "LONDON, United Kingdom (AP) \u2014 Cars lined up at ports while trains and planes filled out fas...", "keywords": "Covid-19Latest NewsToday's Headlines", "og": {"title": "By sea, rail or by air, Brits scramble to get out of France", "site_name": "Jamaica Observer", "image": "http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/JO/20200814/ARTICLE/200819762/AR/0/AR-200819762.jpg"}, "revisit-after": "1 days", "Author": "Jamaica Observer Limited", "DC.Subject": "Jamaica, Observer", "DC.Title": "Jamaica Observer Limited", "ROBOTS": "Follow,Index", "rating": "GENERAL", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@JamaicaObserver", "creator": "@JamaicaObserver", "title": "By sea, rail or by air, Brits scramble to get out of France", "description": "LONDON, United Kingdom (AP) \u2014 Cars lined up at ports while trains and planes filled out fas...", "image": "http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/JO/20200814/ARTICLE/200819762/AR/0/AR-200819762.jpg"}}}}
