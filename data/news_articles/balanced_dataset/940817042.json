The Waislitz Global Citizen Awards are annual cash prizes totaling $250,000 that recognize the excellence of individuals in their work to end extreme poverty. The awards are presented by the Waislitz Foundation and Global Citizen.\n\nThe winner of the Waislitz Global Citizens\u2019 Choice Award and a $50,000 cash prize is Farhad Wajdi, Founder and Executive Director of Ebtakar Inspiring Entrepreneurs of Afghanistan Organization. Farhad empowers women to break into the male-dominated profession of food cart vending in Afghanistan, and during COVID-19 converted these food carts into mobile disinfectant units.\n\nIn 2018, Farhad founded Banu\u2019s Kitchen and built a fleet of solar-powered rickshaws to sell nutritious \u201cfast food\u201d on the streets of Kabul near universities and offices.

His goals are ambitious: to eradicate poverty, gender inequality, and violence against women in Afghanistan. He founded Ebtakar Inspiring Entrepreneurs of Afghanistan, an NGO that helps unemployed youth and underprivileged women get jobs.\n\nIn 2019 he joined The Asia Foundation\u2019s Development Fellows program to build his leadership skills. Fast forward to 2020 and an unprecedented global health crisis, where Farhad saw needs changing fast. \u201cWith Afghanistan locked down, there was no way for our cart vendors, who come from impoverished communities, to earn a living.\u201d To help the vendors financially, Farhad had to find a safe way for them to provide an essential service. He quickly pivoted, and in partnership with UNDP and the Afghan government he transformed the rickshaws into mobile sanitizing stations. Many areas of Afghanistan lack running water and access to healthcare services. \u201cConverting the carts helps both society and the workers,\u201d he says. The rickshaws are out in force now, with drivers suited up in protective gear distributing masks, sanitizing products, and basic information on social distancing and Covid-19. They\u2019ve also set up much-needed handwashing stations and are disinfecting essential areas where people must travel. Farhad says he looks forward to the day when Banu\u2019s Kitchen can resume its original mission, but for now, he says, the work they\u2019re doing is crucial for public health.\n\nRead more about Farhad and Banu\u2019s Kitchen in our InAsia Coronavirus Dispatches.\n\nRelated programs: Asia Foundation Development Fellows\n\n", "METADATA": {"robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Asia Foundation Development Fellow Farhad Wajdi Awarded Waislitz Global Citizens' Choice Award | The Asia Foundation", "description": "August 13, 2020 \u2014 Asia Foundation Development Fellow Farhad Wajdi, an entrepreneur in Afghanistan, has won the Waislitz Global Citizens\u2019 Choice Award and a $50,000 cash prize.
