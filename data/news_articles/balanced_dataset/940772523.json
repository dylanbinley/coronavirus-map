He said: \u201cIt was a bit annoying not to be able to do the exams and prove what I would have been able to do, at the end of the day I know how hard I\u2019ve worked and what I deserve.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s keen to get stuck into his geography degree \u2014 and to move out.\n\nREAD MORE: A Level results day 2020: Live blog as grades come in around Hampstead, Highgate, Camden, Haringey and Barnet\n\nAnd on being the first in his family to enter higher education, he said: \u201cMy family are very happy, dead excited. There\u2019s a lot of pressure but someone\u2019s got to be the first!\u201d\n\nAcross William Ellis and Parliament Hill schools \u2013 also part of the LaSwap consortium, the impact of grade moderation appeared to have been minimised too.\n\nAlfie Sumner-Smith got a scarcely-believable two A*s, two As and a B at Acland Burghley.

It was a bit of a weird time, it almost felt like the results didn\u2019t have much to do with us. When I came in I had prepared for the worst, i didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be quite so nervous.\u201d\n\nWith A*AB, her friend Beth Scully is heading to Sheffield University, where she will study French and history.\n\nAcland Burghley's Finley Dyer is heading for Royal Holloway to study geography.

Moving away will be putting myself in a vulnerable position as I have medical issues \u2014 I\u2019m epileptic. I\u2019m very reliant on family.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s time. I\u2019m looking forward to buying so much stationery. That\u2019s just what I\u2019m like!\u201d\n\nOther pupils, such as Denzel Quartey, 19, are off to film school. Denzel, who is going to Ravensbourne in Greenwich, said: \u201cI\u2019m going to start making short films, maybe realist films, then look to make features.\u201d\n\nAt LaSainte Union, teenage whiz-kids included Katie Stacey whose off to study maths at Bristol with A*A*B \u2013 and Jade Kouakoua who got AAAA and is going to Birmingham to study sociology and criminology.\n\nA group of students with A Level results at LaSwap in Camden, with William Ellis deputy headteacher Izzy Jones.

Definitely for some of my friends who have not got what they wanted, it\u2019s difficult to explain how it feels.\u201d\n\nAnother star performer was Acland Burghley\u2019s Alfie Sumner-Smith, who walked away with an almost-unbelievable A*A*AAB across five subjects. Lockdown was hard, he said, but added: \u201cI think I\u2019m quite good at keeping myself busy. It\u2019s not been great, but I\u2019ve been reading a lot, and it\u2019s been good.\u201d\n\nJoe Dwyer, who scored also got A*AA, is heading for Leeds to study politics and sociology. Joe, who changed his mind over the summer having applied to do maths, told this newspaper: \u201cIt\u2019s better than I would have expected. I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019m looking forward to moving out.\n\nDenzel Quartey, 19, has big plans to make feature films, and he's of to Ravensbourne to do just that.

Picture: Polly Hancock\n\nOne of Joe\u2019s As was in maths, his teacher Dixie McLean said: \u201cHe absolutely deserves it. He\u2019s one of the students, who, when school closed, was telling me he was worried about feeling like a fake, that\u2019s far from true. He put the work in, and should be really proud of his results.\u201d\n\nAt Acland Burghley, more than 75 per cent of students\u2019 grades were A* to C, with 47.8pc getting at least a B. Headteacher Nicholas John said this represented a slight increase on last year \u2013 despite the vagaries of the moderation system. William Ellis and Parliament Hill were yet to release wider results breakdowns.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "twitter": {"card": "photo"}, "title": "A Level results day: Acland Burghley pupil\u2019s success comes after caring for her nan during lockdown, as pupils celebrate at LaSwap amid grades controversy", "DC.title": "A Level results day: Acland Burghley pupil\u2019s success comes after caring for her nan during lockdown, as pupils celebrate at LaSwap amid grades controversy", "og": {"title": "A Level results day: Acland Burghley pupil\u2019s success comes after caring for her nan during lockdown, as pupils celebrate at LaSwap amid grades controversy", "description": "Katie Barton-Hackett is off to follow her dream of dancing professionally \u2013 after helping her nan recover from coronavirus, while Finley Dyer will be the first in his family to do a degree when he heads to Royal Holloway to study geography.", "type": "article", "image": "https://www.hamhigh.co.uk/polopoly_fs/1.6792887!/image/image.jpg", "url": "https://www.hamhigh.co.uk/education/a-level-exam-results/a-level-results-day-2020-laswap-acland-burghley-parliament-hill-highgate-coronavirus-1-6792886", "site_name": "Hampstead Highgate Express"}, "author": "Sam Volpe", "DC.creator": "Sam Volpe", "keywords": "A Level, Education, SecondarySchool", "DC.subject": "A Level, Education, SecondarySchool", "fb": {"pages": 426571590717002}, "description": "Katie Barton-Hackett is off to follow her dream of dancing professionally \u2013 after helping her nan recover from coronavirus, while Finley Dyer will be the first in his family to do a degree when he heads to Royal Holloway to study geography.", "robots": "max-video-preview:-1", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "google-site-verification": "koQrqmlPXFOX2ulzbIqPTAQsBNEAulg-ofQHjpTAIIc", "theme-color": "#FFFFFF"}}}
