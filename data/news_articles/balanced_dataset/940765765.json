Enquiries to trace the man are ongoing.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Bank staff and police diligence prevent almost \u00a37 million worth of fraud across Scotland - The Courier", "description": "Stopping an attempt to con an elderly Fife woman out of \u00a313,500 was one of the successes of a new partnership which prevented nearly \u00a37 million worth of fraudulent transactions across Scotland last year.", "url": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/fife/1511416/bank-staff-and-police-diligence-prevent-almost-7-million-worth-of-fraud-across-scotland/", "site_name": "The Courier", "image": {"identifier": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/07/more-money.jpg", "secure_url": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/07/more-money.jpg", "width": 940, "height": 529}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thecourieruk", "author": "www.facebook.com/thecourieruk", "tag": "fraudsters", "section": "Fife"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Stopping an attempt to con an elderly Fife woman out of \u00a313,500 was one of the successes of a new partnership which prevented nearly \u00a37 million worth of fraudulent transactions across Scotland last year.", "title": "Bank staff and police diligence prevent almost \u00a37 million worth of fraud across Scotland - The Courier", "site": "@thecourieruk", "image": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/07/more-money.jpg", "creator": "@C_CSmith1"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "premium-content": "false", "sailthru.date": "2020-08-14 14:00:49", "sailthru.title": "Bank staff and police diligence prevent almost \u00a37 million worth of fraud across Scotland", "sailthru.tags": "the-courier, Angela McLaren, bank, Banking Protocol, fraud, fraudsters, News, Fife", "sailthru.author": "Craig Smith", "sailthru.description": "Stopping an attempt to con an elderly Fife woman out of \u00a313,500 was one of the successes of a new partnership which prevented nearly \u00a37 million worth of fraudulent transactions across Scotland last year.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/07/more-money.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/07/more-money-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.image.wp-thumbnail": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/07/more-money-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.image.wp-medium": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/07/more-money-300x169.jpg", "sailthru.image.wp-large": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/07/more-money.jpg", "sailthru.image.wp-full": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/07/more-money.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/12/cropped-icon_the-courier-270x270.jpg"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
