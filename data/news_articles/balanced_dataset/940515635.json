Complicating matters, Turkey \u2014 Greece\u2019s historic regional rival \u2014 is also a NATO member but has poor relations with France.\n\nIn a televised statement Wednesday, Mitsotakis warned of the \u201crisk of an accident\u201d in the patch of sea where the Greek and Turkish warships are gathered.\n\n\u201cIn such a case, responsibility lies upon the one who gives rise to these circumstances,\u201d he said. He added that Greece was not averse to \u201ceven the toughest dialogue,\u201d but that \u201cdialogue becomes irrelevant in a climate of tension and provocation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will never be the ones to escalate the situation. Yet, self-restraint is only one aspect of our power,\u201d Mitsotakis said. \u201cNo provocation will ... go unanswered.\"", "METADATA": {"keywords": "wire, dcc, general news, government and politics, seismology, earth science, science", "news_keywords": "wire, dcc, general news, government and politics, seismology, earth science, science", "description": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 Greece's prime minister warmly thanked France Thursday for boosting its military presence in the eastern Mediterranean, where Greek and Turkish warships are closely shadowing each other", "author": "NICHOLAS PAPHITIS and SUZAN FRASER Associated Press", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=375638847", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.gazettetimes.news", "googlebot": "noarchive", "google-site-verification": "vGwC8MQse3Bh_cKhDR-MEXsHPW3rSnLpCJLTgzMpUDA", "msvalidate.01": "106560791A6200A80BCECBE5E23A2EA2", "y_key": "w2TMGyzV34ERNEhyOF2OMtr_7vtynvjI9aztNH_G4RS.L.BXmkDegxxLIucxcNTi", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.gazettetimes.com/news/world/greece-welcomes-french-boost-as-tension-rises-in-east-med/article_f62e0ca4-d50d-5049-a359-e6a5af5ef5e9.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/gazettetimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/da/cda0872f-6487-5163-a154-e11223daf72e/5f33cf639036e.image.jpg?crop=984%2C554%2C0%2C1&resize=984%2C554&order=crop%2Cresize", "width": 984, "height": 554}, "title": "Greece welcomes French boost as tension rises in east Med", "description": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 Greece's prime minister warmly thanked France Thursday for boosting its military presence in the eastern Mediterranean, where Greek and Turkish warships are closely shadowing each other", "site_name": "Corvallis Gazette Times", "section": "World"}, "fb": {"app_id": 118216658221014, "pages": 286221350165}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/gtnews/"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@gtnews", "image": {"alt": "Greece welcomes French boost as tension rises in east Med"}}, "parsely-title": "Greece welcomes French boost as tension rises in east Med", "parsely-link": "https://www.gazettetimes.com/news/world/greece-welcomes-french-boost-as-tension-rises-in-east-med/article_f62e0ca4-d50d-5049-a359-e6a5af5ef5e9.html", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-08-13T09:10:16-0700", "parsely-post-id": "f62e0ca4-d50d-5049-a359-e6a5af5ef5e9", "parsely-image-url": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/gazettetimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/da/cda0872f-6487-5163-a154-e11223daf72e/5f33cf639036e.image.jpg?crop=984%2C554%2C0%2C1&resize=984%2C554&order=crop%2Cresize", "parsely-author": "NICHOLAS PAPHITIS and SUZAN FRASER Associated Press", "parsely-section": "World", "parsely-tags": "wire, dcc, general news, government and politics, seismology, earth science, science, ap"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
