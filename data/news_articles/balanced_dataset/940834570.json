He has also talked about proportionality of punishment for accused priests, but this is the mildest of sanctions.\u201d", "METADATA": {"article": {"published": "2020-08-14T19:45:33.000Z", "modified": "2020-08-14T19:45:33.000Z", "section": "World", "tag": "Poland", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000007289361, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/d09241d8-7945-52da-8cf0-8ca54b00bb3a", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/4fe79ed2d9b74b81965b8749341871e7", "description": "Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Archbishop Slawoj Leszek Glodz of Poland, a move seen as a subtle rebuke.
