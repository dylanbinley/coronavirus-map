I think they have damaged themselves very badly. I think there will be a very difficult way forward, no matter what the way is. I think if they try to come back to this country, they will not be welcomed.\n\n\u201cI think there is a distinct possibility if they don\u2019t make their great fortune that they were hoping to make in Hollywood, they\u2019re going to have to move on to somewhere else. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do. I suspect they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE WAS \u2018FURIOUS\u2019 AT \u2018PROBLEM\u2019 HALF-SISTER SAMANTHA FOR MAKING VICIOUS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HER: BOOK\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE PULLED OUT OF PIPPA MIDDLETON\u2019S WEDDING 'AT THE LAST MINUTE' FOR THIS REASON, BOOK CLAIMS\n\nBefore the bombshell book \u201cFinding Freedom\u201d written by royal reporters Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand was released this summer, Campbell published \u201cMeghan and Harry: The Real Story,\u201d which aims to provide a \u201cbehind-the-scenes authoritative account\u201d on Markle and Prince Harry\u2019s whirlwind romance, high-profile marriage as well as their decision to step back as senior members of the British royal family.\n\nThe former American actress, 39, and the British prince, 35, are residing in Markle\u2019s native California with their son, Archie.\n\nWhile it was initially reported that Harry and Markle cooperated with the authors, reps for the couple confirmed to Fox News that they played no part in the tell-all.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE AND PRINCE HARRY RELOCATE TO NEW HOME IN SANTA BARBARA\n\nHOW PRINCESS EUGENIE FELT ABOUT MEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY SHARING THEIR BABY NEWS AT HER WEDDING REVEALED\n\n\u201cThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to \u2018Finding Freedom,\u2019\u201d said the statement. \u201cThis book is based on the authors\u2019 own experiences as members of the royal press corps and heir own independent reporting.\u201d\n\nCampbell, who previously published a book on Harry\u2019s late mother, Princess Diana, said she spoke to royals, past and present courtiers, fellow aristocrats as well as mutual well-connected friends for her latest release.\n\nIn response to \u201cFinding Freedom,\u201d Campbell slammed that book and called it \u201cfiction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat surprised me the most about Meghan and Harry when I looked into what was really going was what a tremendous opportunity they had to do good all over the world,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd if they were sincere humanitarians, they would know they had an absolutely perfect springboard for doing the most wonderful work and how they were bogged down in petty squabbles.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of his mental health problems and because of her personality problems, they are squandering this tremendous opportunity and making it very unlikely that they would achieve their stated objectives or achieve what everybody hoped they would achieve,\u201d she claimed.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE\u2019S FAITH IN GOD GOT HER THROUGH THE \u2018DARKEST MOMENTS\u2019 OF HER LIFE, BOOK CLAIMS\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE REVEALS SHE\u2019S VOTING IN 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, BREAKING ROYAL FAMILY TRADITION\n\nCampbell alleged the couple wanted to become financially independent and engaged in \u201ccommercial activities,\u201d which are \u201cstrictly forbidden\u201d among royals. She also claimed Markle wanted to openly share her political viewpoints, which is also frowned upon. This has allegedly caused the couple to clash with palace aides who are determined to preserve tradition.\n\n\u201cI thought this is completely unrealistic,\u201d said Campbell. \u201cThis is never going to work. It\u2019s never going to be allowed. I thought this is the making of an absolutely amazing tale, which has proven to me, this is history in the making. But I think the sad thing about it is the squandered opportunity and the fact that nothing they say actually measures up with what they do.\u201d\n\nAccording to Campbell, Markle was initially welcomed with open arms by the royal family and the \u201cred carpet was laid out for her.\u201d However, she alleged things went downhill quickly because the former \u201cSuits\u201d star \u201crefused to respect the parameters within which all royals have to function.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe took the view that if she was rebellious and she did exactly as she pleased that she could prove that she could pass it off as being a modernizing influence,\u201d claimed Campbell. \u201cBut this was not about modernization. This is was about self-indulgence. And people objected to Meghan [being disrespectful] to British tradition and customs\u2026 She completely ignored whatever she was told\u2026 And that\u2019s when the press began to report on it.\u201d\n\nPRINCESS DIANA WOULD'VE MADE PRINCE HARRY, PRINCE WILLIAM 'WORK THROUGH THEIR ISSUES', AUTHOR CLAIMS\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE BELIEVED PRINCESS MICHAEL OF KENT\u2019S RACIST BROOCH WAS SENDING A MESSAGE, BOOK CLAIMS\n\nBoth Markle and Harry have spoken out about the mistreatment they\u2019ve endured by British tabloids. Campbell scoffed at the claims and pointed out that duty should come first when it comes to being a royal.\n\n\u201cI think they are out of touch with reality,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s ironic because they had so much going for them and they had so much prestige. They were the most popular couple in Britain. They could have ended up being one of the most revered couples on Earth if they played their cards right. Instead, they are now the most reviled couple of this country. And it\u2019s entirely due to their conduct.\u201d\n\nCampbell also said she doesn\u2019t believe the couple headed to California for the sake of protecting their firstborn from the glaring spotlight.\n\n\u201cI would not buy into the lie that they moved to California for privacy when they could have had far more privacy hunkered down in Frogmore Cottage,\u201d she slammed. \u201cTo be a British royal means you have an unprecedented level of protection surrounding you. They have removed that level of protection. They have gone to California\u2026 If you are sincere about wanting privacy, you shut up and lead a private life. And when you have something that is a valid public engagement, you do it.\u201d\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE RECEIVED A \u2018MASTER CLASS\u2019 FROM QUEEN ELIZABETH BEFORE LEAVING ROYAL FAMILY, BOOK CLAIMS\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE WAS \u2018EMOTIONAL\u2019 AFTER GETTING IN TROUBLE FOR WEARING NECKLACE WITH PRINCE HARRY\u2019S INITIAL: BOOK\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why they moved to Hollywood - and everybody knows it in the royal family,\u201d she shared. \u201cThey have moved to Hollywood to be free of the constraints and the monitoring that all royals are subjected to\u2026 Meghan never had any intention of settling into the British royal family and leading a quiet, disconnected life from her American activities.\u201d", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "There\u2019s another shocking tell-all on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - and this time, it\u2019s coming from a British aristocrat who, despite being critical of the royal couple, insisted she\u2019s rooting for Meghan Markle.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.creator": "Stephanie Nolasco", "dc.title": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry have \u2018squandered tremendous opportunity\u2019 to do good as royals, author claims", "dcterms.abstract": "There\u2019s another shocking tell-all on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - and this time, it\u2019s coming from a British aristocrat who, despite being critical of the royal couple, insisted she\u2019s rooting for Meghan Markle.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "There\u2019s another shocking tell-all on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - and this time, it\u2019s coming from a British aristocrat who, despite being critical of the royal couple, insisted she\u2019s rooting for Meghan Markle.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:0e9b90b4-782f-5109-958f-5bad74bc50de", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2020-08-13", "dcterms.created": "2020-08-13T11:51:28-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2020-08-14T05:00:00-04:00", "og": {"title": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry have \u2018squandered tremendous opportunity\u2019 to do good as royals, author claims", "description": "There\u2019s another shocking tell-all on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - and this time, it\u2019s coming from a British aristocrat who, despite being critical of the royal couple, insisted she\u2019s rooting for Meghan Markle.", "type": "article", "image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2020/08/12/694940094001_6180533886001_6180539984001-vs.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-prince-harry-have-squandered-tremendous-opportunity-to-do-good-as-royals-author-claims", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry have \u2018squandered tremendous opportunity\u2019 to do good as royals, author claims", "description": "There\u2019s another shocking tell-all on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - and this time, it\u2019s coming from a British aristocrat who, despite being critical of the royal couple, insisted she\u2019s rooting for Meghan Markle.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2020/08/12/1024/512/694940094001_6180533886001_6180539984001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-prince-harry-have-squandered-tremendous-opportunity-to-do-good-as-royals-author-claims"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/FEATURES/Exclusive,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/CELEBRITY NEWS/Meghan Markle,/FOX NEWS/PERSON/Prince Harry,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/GENRES/Books,/FOX NEWS/WORLD/PERSONALITIES/British Royals,/FOX NEWS/TOPIC/Royals,/FOX NEWS/PERSON/Princess Diana", "classification-isa": "exclusive,entertainment,meghan-markle,prince-harry,books,royals,royals,princess-diana", "classification-tags": "exclusive,meghan-markle,prince-harry,books,royals,royals,entertainment,princess-diana"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
