He will be going up against sitting People's National Party (PNP) Member of Parliament (MP) Michael Stewart.\n\nHighly placed JLP sources in the constituency told the Jamaica Observer that Junior Robinson, who had been the party's standard-bearer, pulled out of the race shortly before last Sunday's meeting of the Central Executive in Montego Bay, St James.\n\n\u201cIt was all unexpected and sudden, to begin with; firstly, the departure of the former candidate Mr Robinson. However, after looking at the roots that I have in this constituency, I decided that I will step up and represent the people of Southern Manchester,\u201d Chin told the Observer during an exclusive interview on Monday.\n\nChin said his family has roots in the Newport area of the constituency.\n\nCalls to Robinson's phone went unanswered yesterday.\n\nChin accused the PNP of poor representation, for the past 30 years, in Manchester Southern.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at the representation that the people of Southern Manchester got for the past 30 years, unbroken, I see that the representation is woefully lacking. There is still a cry for water, roads and employment opportunities,\u201d he said.\n\nManchester Southern is made up of four divisions: Alligator Pond, Grove Town, Newport, and Porus, with just over 32,000 electors.\n\nA former JLP caretaker for the Alligator Pond division, Roy Ewers, is not pleased with the party's pick to replace Robinson.\n\n\u201cWe don't know him; that is an impossible thing. I don't see no way why they should have done something like that. I don't waan say nutten too tough, because that come in like mi a go against mi party, but a foolishness dem a do,\u201d Ewers argued.\n\n\u201cDem a dash weh the seat!\u201d he insisted.\n\nThe PNP's Stewart, a first-time MP, received 8,398 votes to the JLP's Hidran McKulsky's 7,222 votes in the 2016 General Election.", "METADATA": {"alexaVerifyID": "rSmiGOPEjbvIe54g6VDdjp7fxDQ", "google-site-verification": "yGWL0JARPWTYZuQO6SyybESnW5Tn5sn_mj5vRQhwZq8", "y_key": "b1206159d404874b", "msvalidate.01": "F356DE1E2BCA8CFA747B5120592BE455", "description": "MANDEVILLE, Manchester \u2014 The Jamaica Labour Party has named former candidate for th...", "keywords": "Central NewsGeneral NewsInternationalLocal NewsVideoToday's Headlines", "og": {"title": "VIDEO: 'Unexpected and sudden'", "site_name": "Jamaica Observer", "image": "http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/JO/20200812/ARTICLE/308129943/AR/0/AR-308129943.jpg"}, "revisit-after": "1 days", "Author": "Jamaica Observer Limited", "DC.Subject": "Jamaica, Observer", "DC.Title": "Jamaica Observer Limited", "ROBOTS": "Follow,Index", "rating": "GENERAL", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@JamaicaObserver", "creator": "@JamaicaObserver", "title": "VIDEO: 'Unexpected and sudden'", "description": "MANDEVILLE, Manchester \u2014 The Jamaica Labour Party has named former candidate for th...", "image": "http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/JO/20200812/ARTICLE/308129943/AR/0/AR-308129943.jpg"}}}}
