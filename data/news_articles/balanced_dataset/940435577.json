It\u2019s scandalous,\u201d Babis said.\n\nSeparately Wednesday, Pompeo said in a speech before the Czech Senate in Prague that China\u2019s economic strength makes it a more formidable rival than the former Soviet Union was during the Cold War.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now isn\u2019t Cold War 2.0. The challenge of resisting the (Chinese Communist Party) threat is in some ways much more difficult. That\u2019s because the CCP is already enmeshed in our economies, in our politics, in our societies in ways the Soviet Union never was,\u201d the secretary of state said.\n\nPompeo, who will later travel to Slovenia, Austria and Poland, on Wednesday also hailed the Czech Republic\u2019s leadership in the area of 5G security.\n\n\u201cYour personal leadership has helped set the course for more than 30 nations and territories to become 5G clean countries. The tide is turning \u2013 there\u2019s no doubt about that \u2013 against untrusted networks and toward the values of free nations,\u201d he said during the press conference in a swipe at Chinese telecommunications companies.\n\nEFE-EPA\n\nvie/mc", "METADATA": {"robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pompeo criticizes use of force against peaceful Belarusian protesters - La Prensa Latina Media", "description": "Prague, Aug 12 (efe-epa).- The United States\u2019 secretary of state expressed support here Wednesday for Belarusian citizens\u2019 demands for freedom and urged the government in Minsk not to use force against peaceful demonstrators. \u201cWe want the people of Belarus to have the freedoms that they\u2019re demanding, that they think are in their best interests,\u201d Mike \u2026", "url": "https://www.laprensalatina.com/pompeo-criticizes-use-of-force-against-peaceful-belarusian-protesters/", "site_name": "La Prensa Latina Media", "image": {"identifier": "https://mk0laprensalatice12d.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/16771346w.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 552}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/laprensalatinamedia", "published_time": "2020-08-13T01:00:02+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@laprensalatina", "site": "@laprensalatina"}, "generator": "WPCOVID-19 1.3.0", "theme-color": "#0088ff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
