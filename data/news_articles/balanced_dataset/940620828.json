Fong was waiting for them outside his house.\n\nThe 100-plus protesters, who call themselves Seattle Everyday Marchers, didn\u2019t surprise Fong\u2014it was the other way round. There were also 30 people waiting to meet the protesters. Fong\u2019s supporters came to \u201cstand with him\u201d to engage the activists. Did he know the protesters were coming? Actually, no.\n\nIn the past few weeks, activists had protested outside elected officials\u2019 homes at night due to their unwillingness to defund Seattle Police by 50%, although they have agreed to cut some funds. These surprise marches have resulted in property damage, physical altercations, denigrating graffiti, and disparaging verbal assaults on elected officials.\n\nFong knew what happened at Mayor Jenny Durkan\u2019s house. People vandalized her home, writing \u201cdie,\u201d \u201cResign bitch,\u201d \u201cguillotine Jenny,\u201d and \u201cJenny is a bitch.\u201d Councilmembers Debora Juarez and Alex Pedersen have had similar experiences. Police Chief Carmen Best\u2019s home was also targetted by protesters.\n\n\u201cWith these events unfolded, I decided to be proactive,\u201c Fong said. Talking and listening would be his response if they show up, even though he doesn\u2019t agree with the protesters\u2019 approaches in pushing for police defunding, he said.\n\nThe encounter\n\nWhen the protesters were looking for Fong\u2019s house in the neighborhood, a voice shouted, \u201cRight here \u2026 I am Mike Fong. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d\n\nDuring the conversation, an activist chanted, \u201cWhose lives matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cBlack lives matter,\u201d Fong\u2019s colleagues and friends responded. Tony Au, with a group of Chinese Americans, was there to support Fong.\n\n\u201cOur goal was to talk to one another \u2026 defuse tension,\u201d said Au. \u201cProtest is good, but not violence and destruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur discussion was heated, but peaceful,\u201d said Fong. At times, the activists yelled at him.\n\n\u201cWe heard their passion, anger, and deep frustration at the persistence of systemic and institutional racism. They have grabbed the attention of City Hall and we are working to make lasting change by creating a more just and equitable city.\n\n\u201cMayor Durkan and her administration are committed to lifting up these voices and taking meaningful action. While we won\u2019t agree on everything, we do share the same vision of dismantling the structural racism that exists in our institutions.\u201d\n\nAu, an immigrant, did his best to find common ground with the protesters\u2014racism.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese community suffers from racism, I told the Black brothers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnti-Asian sentiment due to COVID, had spread in Chinatown since January. We have our hardships. With Trump calling it the \u2018Chinese virus,\u2019 it hurts the community even more.\u201d\n\nAu told the activists that they should direct their anger towards President Trump. His goal was \u201cto calm the protesters.\u201d He also shared with the protesters that he learned about Black history and slavery when he first came to America, from his junior high school teacher, when he was just 15.\n\nAsked not to be identified, one Chinese immigrant, who was there to support Fong, said some protesters asked for eliminating the police completely.\n\n\u201cThe protesters have the right to express their views. But to say there\u2019s no need to have police in Seattle, that\u2019s impossible. How could a city survive without police? What about our safety? It would be chaos.\u201d\n\nHow it happened\n\nAt 7 a.m. on Aug. 6, a mayoral staff member learned through social media that the BLM organizers were assembling at Eckstein Middle School at 7 p.m., but without disclosing their actual destination.\n\nThere were two sides to Fong\u2019s thinking. He could be the protesters\u2019 next target because he lives close to the school, plus the other three elected officials being protested also live in the North end. But then, he is a non-elected official, and he might be spared.\n\nBy mid-morning, Fong decided that he would meet with the activists face-to-face. He called and texted several senior staff members from Mayor Durkan\u2019s office to join him, along with family, friends, and neighbors before the march in his front yard to participate in a dialogue with the group on systemic racism and policing. The other two deputy mayors also joined him.\n\nNo destruction\n\nThe protesters were respectful of Fong\u2018s property and reminded the other members not to step on the property, but on the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t cross the line,\u201c said Fong. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do anything. They made their point and they went home.\u201d\n\nAu said Fong did a good job engaging with the protesters.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t call the police as it would escalate tension during the protesters\u2019 march. They left without touching his house or disturbing the front part of the house.\u201d\n\nActivists were less kind to council members\n\nThe activists had visited Councilmember Pedersen\u2019s house the night before they went to Fong\u2019s house (also in Northeast Seattle). Knowing they were coming, through social media, Pedersen decided to go to where the activists met, and marched two miles with them from the Burke Museum to his house. At the end of the march, he and the activists sat down and talked. He said they were \u201cmore forgiving\u201d after they talked.\n\nBut the first time the protesters came, Pedersen said his family was shaken.\n\n\u201dMy daughters and spouse were scared,\u201d he said. For their safety, Pedersen has now relocated his family. The activists visited his house as many as four to five times (at night and in the morning).\n\nCouncilmember Juarez felt so threatened that she invited several tribal leaders to stand with her when the marchers arrived. It\u2019s what the Seattle Times\u2019 editorial called \u201cbullying\u201d and \u201cintimidation\u201d of the officials and their family last week, on the activists\u2019 protest outside the official\u2019s home.\n\nProtest is not the only way\n\n\u201cThere are other ways to make your voice heard besides yelling, and the tactic of going to (people\u2019s) homes in the middle of the night,\u201d Fong said. He said he is accessible. \u201cThey know how to get a hold of me.\u201d And he has agreed to meet with the activists again.\n\n\u201cPeople have the right to protest, but it has to be peaceful,\u201d said Pedersen. \u201cThe protests, trespassing, and threats are unproductive.\u201d\n\nJust how productive was the activists\u2019 march at Fong\u2018s place? Didn\u2018t they know that Fong, as deputy mayor, would follow Durkan\u2018s position on the issue of police defunding?\n\n\u201cI work for the mayor, so my work is an extension from her authority and of course, it\u2019s the same,\u201d said Fong.\n\nFong was grateful for the Chinese community\u2019s support and presence, and his friends and colleagues during the protest.\n\n\u201cWhen I got the word Mike needed us, I just went. I have no second thoughts,\u201d said one Chinese supporter.\n\nPerhaps, so grateful that the next day, he came to Chinatown-International District to buy dim sum takeouts for lunch.\n\nThe storm is far from over. A smaller group of protesters visited Durkan\u2018s house on Aug. 8, and painted graffiti. Families of police and supporters held a rally at Seattle City Hall to defend the police. On Aug. 10, the Seattle City Council approved proposals that would reduce the police department by as many as 100 officers through layoffs and attrition\u2014reductions far short of the 50% cut that many BLM protesters want.\n\nThe City Council also cut Police Chief Carmen Best\u2019s roughly $285,000 annual salary and the pay of other top police leaders.\n\nAssunta can be reached at assunta@nwasianweekly.com.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "BLM protesters target Deputy Mayor\u2019s house \u2014 Mike Fong surprised them by waiting outside", "url": "http://nwasianweekly.com/2020/08/blm-protesters-target-deputy-mayors-house-mike-fong-surprised-them-by-waiting-outside/", "description": "Visit the post for more.", "site_name": "Northwest Asian Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/nwasianweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FRONT-1.jpg?fit=960%2C720", "width": 960, "height": 720}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-08-13T17:30:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-08-13T18:15:40+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@nwasianweekly", "text": {"title": "BLM protesters target Deputy Mayor\u2019s house \u2014 Mike Fong surprised them by waiting outside"}, "image": "https://i0.wp.com/nwasianweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FRONT-1.jpg?fit=960%2C720&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Visit the post for more."}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i2.wp.com/nwasianweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cropped-logoicon.jpg?fit=270%2C270"}}}
