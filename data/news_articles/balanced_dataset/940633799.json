One is the selection of a property ownership company that will have the legal ownership of the two outfits (economic zones). We will then approve a concessionaire through a competitive bidding process which Ernest and Young will guide us through, and then the concessionaire will sign a management company that will be in the process of managing the tenants and all the people who are going to be operating there.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, essentially, the property ownership company will own the legal title, while the concessionaire will develop the internal infrastructure and the management company will be the entity that will interface with the various tenants.\n\nHe stated that the BPE would sign a very watertight concessioning agreement with the eventual successful concessionaires for the SEZs, which will ensure that all the developmental objectives of the economic zones are realised.\n\nOkoh noted that the target was for the process leading to the concessioning of the two economic zones to be concluded within nine months.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2019/08/f00100e8-adeniyi-adebayo.jpg", "secure_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2019/08/f00100e8-adeniyi-adebayo.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 703}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "FG, Transaction Partner Sign MoU to Concession Calabar, Kano Special Economic Zones - THISDAYLIVE", "description": "By Ndubuisi Francis The federal government on Thursday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with multinational professional services company, Ernest & Young, the preferred transaction partner for the planned concessionning of the Calabar and Kano Special Economic Zones (SEZs).
