After his talks in Minsk in early June, Kerner recalls, Prime Minister Victor Orb\u00e1n urged Europe to end the remaining sanctions against Belarus (most such measures were lifted in 2016).\n\nhvg.hu finds it telling that the government appears to be waiting before dispatching its routine telegram of congratulations to President Lukashenko on his re-election. (According to diplomatic protocol that message should be sent by President \u00c1der.) Government sources did not reply to hvg\u2019s question whether such an official telegram has already been sent to Minsk.\n\nIn an angry article in N\u00e9pszava, Mikl\u00f3s Hargitai accuses the Prime Minister of entertaining friendly relations with dictators, and interprets his attitude toward Lukashenko in that context. He recalls that while in Minsk, the Prime Minister said the two peoples are closer to each other than is commonly thought. He adds that the people of Belarus have now visibly had enough of their number one leader.\n\nFeatured photo by Zolt\u00e1n Fischer/PM\u2019s Press Office/MTI", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "After the PM\u2019s visit to Belarus, left-wing outlets ponder what choices remain open to him as Lukashenko\u2019s victory is believed to be due to electoral fraud.", "google-site-verification": "5wn5B9jlZqRdaaRG0TTZcJWN_ThLzt2VyiRPrWfMjZs", "og": {"title": "Hungarian Press Roundup: Hungary\u2019s Lukashenko Dilemma - Hungary Today", "description": "After the PM\u2019s visit to Belarus, left-wing outlets ponder what choices remain open to him as Lukashenko\u2019s victory is believed to be due to electoral fraud.", "image": {"identifier": "https://hungarytoday.hu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Download-3.jpg", "width": 2048, "height": 1366}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "url": "https://hungarytoday.hu/hungarian-press-roundup-hungarys-lukashenko-dilemma/", "site_name": "Hungary Today"}, "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/hungarytoday/", "published_time": "2020-08-13T08:09:02+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@HungaryToday", "site": "@HungaryToday"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hungarytoday.hu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cropped-favicon-270x270.png"}}}
