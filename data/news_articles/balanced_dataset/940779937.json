The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nWith friends like these, who needs enemies?\n\nMany Palestinians will be reciting a version of this adage on Friday, a day after the United Arab Emirates said it had agreed to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel in a U.S.-brokered deal.\n\nThe announcement was widely cheered within Israel, the U.S., Europe and even some corners of the Middle East, but it provoked despair among many Palestinians who feel abandoned by their traditional allies, many of whom have turned their focus away from Israel and onto Shiite Iran as their enemy.\n\n\u201cMay you never be sold out by your 'friends,'\u201d the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi tweeted in reaction to the announcement by the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates. \u201cMay you never experience the agony of having your country stolen; may you never feel the pain of living in captivity under occupation.\u201d\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas\u2019s spokesman called UAE's actions a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of Jerusalem and the Palestinian cause.\n\nIf Israel and the UAE go ahead and sign bilateral agreements that would allow for investment, direct flights, tourism and the establishment of reciprocal embassies, among other things, it would be the first time the world\u2019s only Jewish state has normalized relations with a Gulf nation. The UAE, like most of the Arab world, had long rejected ties with Israel in the absence of a peace deal establishing a Palestinian state.\n\nFor the Palestinians, it was not good enough that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the day-to-day ruler of the United Arab Emirates, emphasized that the agreement would stop \"further\" Israeli annexation of Palestinian territory.\n\nDuring a call with President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu, an agreement was reached to stop further Israeli annexation of Palestinian territories. The UAE and Israel also agreed to cooperation and setting a roadmap towards establishing a bilateral relationship. \u2014 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0632\u0627\u064a\u062f (@MohamedBinZayed) August 13, 2020\n\nAfter World War II, the newly formed Arab League opposed the creation of Israel and later opposed recognizing it. After Israel\u2019s creation, citizens were unable to travel to any Arab state on an Israeli passport until Egypt made peace with Israel in 1979, followed by Jordan in 1994. Despite the peace treaties, relations with these states remained cold.\n\nLet our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.

In 1973, Egyptian forces launched a surprise attack across the Suez Canal in a war that would lead to the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty.\n\nFast forward 47 years. Despite the fact that the majority of the international community supports a two-state solution, which would see Palestinians set up a country alongside Israel, Palestinians feel increasingly isolated internationally.\n\nSince 1948, Israel has pushed farther into Palestinian territories whether through war or settlement building, making the establishment of an independent Palestinian state seem more unlikely.\n\nAnd in recent years Arab nations such as the United Arab Emirates have begun to see Iran as a greater threat than Israel in the region. This, among other reasons, has displaced the Palestinian cause \u2014 long a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre on the Arab street.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announces that Israel and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to normalize relations. Kevin Lamarque / Reuters\n\n\u201cWhat has happened is that Palestine that used to be the mother of all questions in the Arab world is no longer really seen as fundamental,\u201d said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics.\n\nNow, mutual hostility toward Iran (and its proxies), and concern that Tehran is seeking nuclear weapons have driven nations, once opposed, closer together. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons.\n\nOther factors include the collapse of the notion of a pan-Arab security system as in recent years Arab states descended into civil strife and called on other non-Arab states, including Israel, to intervene on their behalf, Gerges said.\n\nGerges cautioned, however, that the Palestinian cause continues to resonate deeply in the minds of the Arab people.\n\nPalestinian families sit at \"Maldive Gaza\" cafe on a beach in Gaza City Aug. 5. Mohammed Salem / Reuters\n\nIn the Gaza Strip, a blockaded Palestinian enclave run by hard-line Islamist group Hamas, and in the heart of the West Bank, Palestinians also saw Thursday\u2019s news as a betrayal.\n\n\u201cWe are losing brothers. We thought they were on our side, only to discover that they were against us,\u201d said Ahmed Shurab, 54, a clothes salesman in Gaza City.\n\nThousands took to the streets in the Gaza Strip on Friday to protest what demonstrators described as the \u201cbetrayal of Palestine.\u201d\n\nSome Palestinians were also skeptical that this agreement would be the end of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s annexation ambitions.\n\nIn televised remarks from Jerusalem on Thursday night, Netanyahu said he was \u201ccommitted\u201d to extending Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank, territory that was captured by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and which Palestinians see as the basis of their future state along with east Jerusalem and Gaza.\n\nFor many Palestinians then, the agreement was perceived as a loss on two fronts.\n\nAnalysts also cited a divided and aging Palestinian leadership \u2014 exemplified by the divide between Hamas in Gaza and Abbas\u2019 more secular government in the West Bank \u2014 as among the reasons Palestinians find themselves more isolated.\n\nWael Abu Niaama, an attorney from Ramallah in the West Bank, blamed the Palestinian leadership for not taking stronger positions against Gulf states who had signaled they were willing to make concessions to Israel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a result of the Palestinian leadership\u2019s weakness,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me this was something that I was just waiting to happen.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "METADATA": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613, "pages": 1508175089456029}, "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/uae-makes-nice-israel-palestinians-decry-betrayal-n1236718", "title": "Israel-UAE deal leaves Palestinians more isolated than ever", "description": "Analysis: \u201cMay you never be sold out by your 'friends,'\u201d veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi tweeted in reaction to the announcement of the agreement.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_33/3404500/200914-palestinins-mc-9272_b5c020fe7b4986ef965aec1929db667a.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.JPG", "secure_url": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_33/3404500/200914-palestinins-mc-9272_b5c020fe7b4986ef965aec1929db667a.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.JPG", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NBCNews", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_33/3404500/200914-palestinins-mc-9272_b5c020fe7b4986ef965aec1929db667a.nbcnews-fp-1024-512.JPG", "title": "Israel-UAE deal leaves Palestinians more isolated than ever", "description": "Analysis: \u201cMay you never be sold out by your 'friends,'\u201d veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi tweeted in reaction to the announcement of the agreement.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Many Palestinians feel betrayed and isolated in the Arab world after the United Arab Emirates agreed to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_33/3404500/200914-palestinins-mc-9272_b5c020fe7b4986ef965aec1929db667a.social_share_1024x768_scale.JPG", "next-head-count": 89}}}
