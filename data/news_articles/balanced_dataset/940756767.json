So if today, the project has finally been awarded and we're all gathered here for its sod cutting, then we owe Nana Akufo-Addo and the Road Minister a big thank you\", said Okyem Aboagye.\n\n\n\nOn his part, the Akyeamehene of Kokoso, Nana Adjei Boakye said, he was equally thankful to Nana Akufo-Addo and his NPP government for the decision to award the town roads in the area to be constructed. He said residents in area have not seen any major rehabilitation on their roads over the years.\n\n\n\n\"This road has been a major issue here. President Kufour tried to construct it but unfortunately there a change of government. So if today the NPP is in power again and they have awarded this road to a contractor, I can only express my innermost appreciation to Nana Addo and his government for not disappointing us\", Nana Boakye said.\n\n\n\nOther dignitaries who were present at the event were; Mayor of the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly, Hon.
