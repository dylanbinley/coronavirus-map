There was no word of apology from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who gave thanks for the sacrifices of the Japanese war dead but had nothing to say about the suffering of Japan\u2019s neighbors.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Press Visitors in Japanese Imperial army and navy uniforms stand at attention to pay their respects to the war dead at Yasukuni Shrine Saturday, Aug. 15, 2020, in Tokyo.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)\n\n\u201cReflecting on our past and bearing in mind the feelings of deep remorse, I earnestly hope that the ravages of war will never be repeated,\u201d Naruhito said in a short speech at the event in Tokyo marking the 75th anniversary of Japan\u2019s surrender on Aug. 15, 1945.\n\nAmid virus fears and worries about the fading memories of the fast-aging war generation, about 500 participants, reduced from 6,200 last year, mourned the dead with a minute of silence. Masks were required, and there was no singing of the \u201cKimigayo\u201d national anthem.\n\nNaruhito has promised to follow in the footsteps of his father, who devoted his 30-year career to making amends for a war fought in the name of Hirohito, the current emperor\u2019s grandfather.\n\nAbe has increasingly sought to whitewash Japan\u2019s brutal past since taking office in December 2012. He hasn't acknowledged Japan\u2019s wartime hostilities during Aug. 15 speeches, which had previously been a nearly 20-year tradition that began with the 1995 apology of Socialist leader Tomiichi Murayama.\n\nAbe, in a largely domestic-focused speech, said the peace that Japan enjoys today is built on the sacrifices of those who died in the war. He pledged that Japan will reflect on lessons from history and will not repeat the war devastation. He listed damage inflicted on Japan and its people, including the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, massive firebombings of Tokyo and the fierce battle of Okinawa.\n\nAbe pledged to play a greater role in tackling global problems. Under his goal of turning Japan into a \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d nation, Abe has steadily pushed to cleanse Japan of its embarrassing wartime history and build up its military by stretching the interpretation of Japan's war-renouncing constitution. It includes acquiring greater missile defense capability in the face of a growing military threat from North Korea and China.\n\n\u201cRemembering those days, I strongly feel we should never wage war,\u201d said Shoji Nagaya, 93, who traveled from Hokkaido in northern Japan to commemorate his brother who died of illness while serving in China. \u201cBut politicians today seem to have different views than ours, and I really hope that they will not head to a wrong direction.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Press Visitors in Japanese Imperial army and navy uniforms walk near Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan's war dead, Saturday, Aug. 15, 2020, in Tokyo.

He sent a religious offering through a lawmaker, a gesture meant to avoid angering China and South Korea, which consider the Yasukuni shrine a symbol of Japan\u2019s militarism. Abe last visited Yasukuni in December 2013.\n\nFour members of his Cabinet did visit the shrine, the first ministerial visit in four years. Among them was Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi who repeatedly visited the shrine on different occasions, including his last visit as serving prime minister on Aug. 15, 2006, that sparked criticism from China and South Korea.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Press Visitors queue at intervals for social distance to prevent the spread of coronavirus at Yasukuni Shrine Saturday, Aug. 15, 2020, in Tokyo.

This should not be a diplomatic problem,\u201d Internal Affairs Minister Sanae Takaichi, an ultra-conservative who shares Abe's historical views, told reporters after praying at the shrine.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Press A visitor in Japanese Imperial army uniforms walks near Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan's war dead, Saturday, Aug. 15, 2020, in Tokyo.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)\n\nRepeated Yasukuni visits by Japanese government officials \u201cindicates that on the issue of history, Japan has not completely abandoned militarism,\u201d said Wang Shaopu, a Japanese studies professor at Jiao Tong University and honorary president of the Japan Society of Shanghai.\n\n\u201cJapan\u2019s invasion of China has brought huge disaster to the Chinese people. Under these circumstances, if Japan doesn't face up to historical issues, how could we be sure that japan will follow the path of peace in the future?\u201d\n\nKosaburo Tanaka, a martial arts association manager, traveled from Osaka to give thanks for Japan's postwar peace. \u201cJapan hasn't been in any war over the last 75 years and we were able to live peacefully. I think that's all because of the spirits that rest here in Yasukuni. They protect the peace.\"\n\nNobuko Bamba a retiree whose grandmother, uncle and aunt died in the March 10, 1945, U.S. firebombing of Tokyo, thinks both sides of history should be remembered.\n\n\u201cThere are many people who don\u2019t know anything about the war, not only the suffering of the Japanese people, but there are also things that Japanese people did, bad things,\u201d Bamba said. \u201cUnless we teach these things to future generations, I don\u2019t think war would end.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Press A visitor in Japanese Imperial army uniforms walks near Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan's war dead, Saturday, Aug. 15, 2020, in Tokyo.
