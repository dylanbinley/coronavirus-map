He was not given fair hearing and the opportunity to defend himself.\n\n\u201cThe Senate therefore rejects the removal of Prof Ogundipe and the appointment of an Acting VC,\u201d a member, who attended the meeting, told SaharaReporters.", "METADATA": {"description": "They also kicked against the appointment of Prof Omololu Soyombo as Acting Vice Chancellor of the institution.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Sahara Reporters", "type": "article", "url": "http://saharareporters.com/2020/08/13/breaking-unilag-senate-rejects-acting-vice-chancellor-says-prof-ogundipe-remains-vc", "description": "They also kicked against the appointment of Prof Omololu Soyombo as Acting Vice Chancellor of the institution."}, "dcterms.creator": "siteadmin", "dcterms.date": "2020-08-13T07:23-04:00", "dcterms.type": "Text", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.identifier": "http://saharareporters.com/2020/08/13/breaking-unilag-senate-rejects-acting-vice-chancellor-says-prof-ogundipe-remains-vc", "dcterms.language": "und", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/default/themes/sr_theme/images/components/icons/win8-tile-icon.png"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
