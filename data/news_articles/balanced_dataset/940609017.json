The program uses a mobile training unit to improve awareness of grain entrapment risks and provide training on grain rescues and grain extrication procedures.\n\n\u201cFar too often, poor decisions are made in a rescue situation,\u201d Gobeil said.\n\n\u201cThe wrong decision can make a bad situation worse so it\u2019s critical to learn the theory behind a successful rescue and to have a little bit of practical training that will help make smart decisions and get people out safely.\u201d\n\nRecently, CASA\u2019s efforts to provide grain rescue training got a significant boost from farm input supplier Corteva Agriscience Canada.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCorteva announced last month (July 22) that it would provide funding to help CASA host eight grain entrapment training sessions across Canada. The sessions will be held at yet-to-be-determined locations in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.\n\nDetails of the sessions have yet to be finalized but the training will be open to qualified fire fighters from rural fire departments across the five provinces.\n\nIn addition, Corteva plans to buy eight sets of grain entrapment rescue equipment to be distributed among rural fire departments that complete CASA\u2019s BeGrainSafe training program.\n\nThe rescue equipment, valued at about $4,000 per set, consists of a Haul-All Pencil Auger and a specially designed GSI Res-Q-Tube, which acts as a cofferdam.\n\nDuring a rescue situation, a cofferdam is placed around the entrapment victim and is pushed down into the grain mass.\n\nAfter the cofferdam is in place, the pencil auger is used to remove grain from around the victim. Once enough grain has been removed, the entrapment victim can be safely extricated.\n\nKris Allen, a Calgary-based communications leader with Corteva, said the opportunity to contribute life-saving equipment and funding for training seemed like an ideal way for the company to show appreciation to Canadian farm families.\n\n\u201cHandling grain is an every day occurrence in the agriculture industry, meaning unexpected grain incidents can happen at any moment,\u201d Allen said.\n\nGobeil said the benefits of CASA\u2019s grain rescue training program were demonstrated last year near Leamington, Ont., when a young farm visitor became entrapped in a gravity flow grain wagon.\n\n\u201cA girl from the city was visiting friends on a farm and\u2026 for whatever reason, she thought it looked pretty cool watching this gravity flow wagon empty its contents,\u201d Gobeil said.\n\n\u201cShe jumped in without understanding how flowing grain works and how quickly you can sink. She was just unaware.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe got trapped but luckily enough, they stopped the flow of grain just in time. Her nose and her mouth were about all that was sticking out of the grain at that point.\u201d\n\nWith the help of a firefighter who had been trained in grain entrapment rescues, the local fire department was able to fabricate a makeshift cofferdam using boards and signage. The girl was safely extricated.\n\nAllen said Leamington was one of the first locations to get the training and a week later, they rescued the girl.\n\nFor more information, interested groups can contact CASA at 877-452-2272 or by email at info@casa-acsa.ca.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Harvest season is just around the corner and a new grain crop will soon be going into storage.
