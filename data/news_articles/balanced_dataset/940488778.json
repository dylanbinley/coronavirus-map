What is it that we believe that we can do, not just the United States unilaterally, but in a multilateral way to deliver good outcomes for the Belarusian people, whether that turns out to be sanctions or turns out to be making decisions about product deliveries? Those are all things that are yet to be determined,\" Pompeo said in an interview with RFE/RL published on the US State Department\u2019s website.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to have to work through that,\" the US secretary of state said in response to the question on the possible changes made to the US-Belarus relations, namely in relation to the deliveries of US oil to Belarus and the dispatching the US ambassador to Minsk. \"As you said, we were incredibly troubled by the election and deeply disappointed that it wasn\u2019t more free and more fair. We\u2019ve seen this behavior before, and we regret that this is how it\u2019s transpired. Then we\u2019ve watched the violence and the aftermath, peaceful protesters being treated in ways that are inconsistent with how they should be treated,\" he said.\n\n\"We haven\u2019t settled out what the appropriate response is, but I can tell you this: We\u2019ll work with our European friends, our freedom-loving friends here who are equally concerned about what took place. We want good outcomes for the Belarusian people and we\u2019ll take actions consistent with that,\" Pompeo concluded.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": "136273049729218,160111214030709", "app_id": 318186228278257, "restricted-to": "fbOnly", "admins": "1020410409,1457856367,100000027310340,100000461932416,100000632702463"}, "description": "Due to the current events in the country\u2026", "og": {"title": "Pompeo not ruling out US imposing sanctions on Belarus", "url": "https://news.am/eng/news/596655.html", "image": "https://news.am/img/news/59/66/55/default.jpg"}, "google-site-verification": "1agLRpnrwPTOhS41sKfmeOWfXQhZUl_MsJQ7iroTVzs"}}, "LABEL": {"WANT_ON_MAP": false, "NOTES": ["No Coronavirus Keywords"]}}
