The clashes begun on Tuesday and have continued in these communities.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm the communal dispute between Niamina Sambang Fula Kunda and Mandinka Kunda on 11th August 2020. The incident resulted in 22 injuries from both sides including a woman and three compounds in Fula Kunda were burnt,\u201d Police Spokesman Superintendent Lamin Njie said.\n\n\u201cEqually, an investigation is opened into the matter.\u201d\n\nAsked if any arrests have been made, Njie said details of arrests have not reached his office so far, hence investigations to get all those involved continue.\n\nViolence between the two communities continues to flare up since communal tensions broke out over disputed rice fields in 2018.\n\nAccording to media reports, the incident occurred when a donkey from one of the rival communities entered into the farmland of others leading to confrontation.\n\n\u201cA donkey from the Mandinka community entered the farm of one man from the Fula community,\u201d according to an eye witness.\n\n\u201cI can even confirm that the two villages also clashed yesterday as the Fula community vowed to revenge. Currently, personnel of the Police Intervention Unit (PIU) have been deployed in the area to calm the situation and maintain peace and order,\u201d a source said.\n\nGambian Police has arrested 11 people in connection with the incident and are being detained at Bansang Police Station.
