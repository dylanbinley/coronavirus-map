It's the last taste of Imploding The Mirage, which arrives next week.\n\nKicking off like it's a Crack Cloud tune, The Killers soon move into some big boy heartland rock by way of proper rock drum breakdown. Drama, drama, drama! Imploding The Mirage looks set to be a real corker for the heatwave, what with three juicy singles already out in the open.\n\nThe Killers first unveiled plans for their new album back in March with the soaring 'Caution' - a summertime banger charged with a proper Lindsey Buckingham riff. Since then, they've also shared 'My Own Soul's Warning'.\n\nSee all the rescheduled dates for the live UK and Ireland Tour - now slap-bang in the middle of summer 2021. They'll see support from Sam Fender, Manic Street Preachers and Blossoms.\n\nMAY\n\n25 - Doncaster, Keepmoat Stadium\n\n27 - Bristol, Ashton Gate Stadium\n\n29 - Coventry, Ricoh Stadium\n\n31 - Southampton, St Mary's Stadium\n\nJUNE\n\n02 - Norwich, Carrow Road Stadium\n\n04 - London, Emirates Stadium\n\n05 - London, Emirates Stadium\n\n08 - Falkirk, The Falkirk Stadium\n\n10 - Middlesborough, Riverside Stadium\n\n12 - Manchester, Emirates Old Trafford\n\n15 - Dublin, Malahide Castle\n\n16 - Dublin, Malahide Castle", "METADATA": {"og": {"url": "https://www.gigwise.com/news/3387530/the-killers-share-dying-breed", "type": "website", "title": "The Killers share 'Dying Breed' | Gigwise", "description": "New album Imploding The Mirage is out next week | Gigwise", "image": "https://media.livehub.me/image_82c6b8db-058a-4e65-8d04-cd37864369d7.jpg?width=1500&height=1000", "tags": "Music News, Photos, Gig Tickets, Music Videos, Album Reviews, Live Reviews, Band Interviews, Festivals, Festival Guide"}, "keywords": "Gigwise, The, Killers, share, Dying, Breed", "description": "New album Imploding The Mirage is out next week | Gigwise  />\t\t\r\n\t\t<meta name=", "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "1 days", "externallink": "/news/3387530/the-killers-share-dying-breed", "bitly-verification": "4b2c6ffaca7a", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@gigwise", "domain": "Gigwise.com", "title": "The Killers share 'Dying Breed' | Gigwise", "description": "New album Imploding The Mirage is out next week | Gigwise", "image": "https://media.livehub.me/image_82c6b8db-058a-4e65-8d04-cd37864369d7.jpg?width=1500&height=1000", "url": "https://www.gigwise.com/news/3387530/the-killers-share-dying-breed"}}}}
