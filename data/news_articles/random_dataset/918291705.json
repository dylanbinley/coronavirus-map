It\u2019s not something that\u2019s affected by other countries\u2019 decisions on funding.\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe WHO has come in for heavy criticism over its response to coronavirus and its work with China, which is accused of covering up elements of its own health crisis.\n\nBut while Downing Street said the organisation should \"continue to learn lessons\", officials pointed the finger more firmly at China. Boris Johnson's spokesman said: \"We\u2019ve always stressed that transparent and accurate information about the virus is essential for a global response\u201d.\n\nFormer MI6 chief John Sawers told the BBC: \"There is deep anger in America at what they see as having been inflicted on us all by China and China is evading a good deal of responsibility for the origin of the virus, for failing to deal with it initially.\n\n\"Intelligence is about acquiring information which has been concealed from you by other states and other actors, there was a brief period in December and January when the Chinese were indeed concealing this from the West.\"\n\nOther UK politicians and medical experts joined the attack on President Trump - saying it was \"short-sighted\" and \"hypocritical\".\n\nUK Labour leader Keir Starmer told LBC Trump's decision was \"completely the wrong thing to do.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe added: \"There needs to be a global response to this... This is not the time to be retreating and pulling away from global organisations.\"\n\nLib Dem Foreign Affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael branded it \"a dereliction of duty\" that \"puts lives at risk around the world\"\n\nDr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: \"Politically volatile leadership is rarely constructive or helpful at times of crisis.\"\n\nHe added: \"If the USA acts provocatively over global health and biosecurity, it will become a very big problem.\n\n\"The effects would be seen worldwide, but also rebounding back on to the USA where high-threat pathogens would be more likely to occur in future.\"\n\nDr Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the University of Leeds School of Medicine, said: \"This most recent intervention in public health policy by President Trump is perhaps one of the least productive, most short-sighted, self-motivated and hypocritical acts I have ever witnessed.\n\n\"As far as I can ascertain, it has no foundation in reality.\"\n\nMeanwhile several world leaders spoke out. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell tweeted: \"Deeply regret U.S. decision to suspend funding to WHO.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"There is no reason justifying this move at a moment when their efforts are needed more than ever.\"\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said apportioning blame did not help. \"The virus knows no borders,\" Maas said on Twitter.\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the WHO was essential to tackling the pandemic.\n\n\"At a time like this when we need to be sharing information and we need to have advice we can rely on, the WHO has provided that,\" she said. \"We will continue to support it and continue to make our contributions.\"\n\nChina urged the United States on Wednesday to fulfil its obligations to WHO.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the pandemic was at a critical stage and that Washington's decision would affect the whole world.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he sympathised with Trump's criticisms of the WHO, especially its \"unfathomable\" support of re-opening China's \"wet markets\", where freshly slaughtered, and live, animals are sold.\n\n\"But that said, the WHO also as an organisation does a lot of important work including here in our region in the Pacific and we work closely with them,\" Morrison told an Australian radio station.\n\n\"We are not going to throw the baby out of with the bathwater here, but they are also not immune from criticism.\""}}
