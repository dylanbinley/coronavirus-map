Located in area of the Permian Basin known as the Delaware Basin, the wells target the Wolfcamp formation down to a total depth of 14,000 feet.\n\nFounded in June 2018 and financially backed by the Dallas private equity firm Stronghold Resource Partners, Wheat Energy Partners spent the last two years participating in joint ventures across the state but in October, the company registered with the Railroad Commission as an operator, giving it the authority to drill for and produce oil and natural gas anywhere in Texas.\n\nThe drilling permits mark the first projects for Wheat Energy Partners under the company\u2019s own name and come as crude oil prices are trading around $20 per barrel, well below the $55 needed by most shale drillers.\n\nFounder and CEO Travis Wheat said Wheat Energy does not plan to drill immediately and under its leases, has a year or more to negotiate prices with service companies or take on partners to develop the wells. With one-mile laterals planned for the wells, Wheat said landing a good service deal means that the wells would be profitable at $25 per barrel.\n\nMore Information Top 10 Drillers (April 29 through May 5) SM Energy 8 Diamondback Energy 7 ConocoPhillips 5 Pioneer Natural Resources 4 Wheat Energy Partners 4 Matador Resources 4 EOG Resources 4 WPX Energy 3 Kinder Morgan 3 Tall City Exploration 2 Source: Railroad Commission of Texas\n\nRead More\n\n\u201cA lot of people are sitting on the sidelines but that\u2019s the last thing you need to do at a time like this,\u201d Wheat said.\n\nDrilling Down: British petrochemical giant Ineos plans to begin fracking in Texas\n\nPermian Basin\n\nDenver oil company SM Energy plans to drill five horizontal wells in Upton County and another three in Martin County.
