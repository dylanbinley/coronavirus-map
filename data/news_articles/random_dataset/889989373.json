Though the tree has already been cut from the field, this ensures that the pores are open to absorb the water and stay healthy.\n\nPlacement also is crucial, said George. The tree should be placed away from any radiators, heat vents, candles or other heat sources. Faulty Christmas lights also could cause a safety hazard."}}
