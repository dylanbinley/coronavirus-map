I scrutinised his arguments and I considered his sources.\n\nI welcome his submissions but I respectfully disagree with his conclusions. I maintain my original position and I stand by what I wrote in my essay: I am NOT a Yoruba but a son of Oduduwa.\n\nThere are two demeaning and insulting names and words that the Fulani gave and used to describe southerners.\n\nFirstly came \u201cNyamiri\u201d (meaning \u2018fetcher of water\u2019) in reference to the people of the South-East and secondly \u201cYariba\u201d in reference to the people of the South-West.\n\nThe South-East rejected that name but the South-West accepted theirs. The name \u201cYoruba\u201d derives from the word \u201cYariba\u201d and it means \u201cshady and unreliable\u201d. I reject that strange name and label and I hope and pray that the good people of the South-Western Nigeria will see the wisdom in doing so too.\n\nI am not a \u201cYariba\u201d or \u201cYoruba\u201d but an \u201cOmo Karo Jire\u201d or an \u201cOoduwan\u201d and my language is not \u201cYoruba\u201d but \u201cAnago\u201d. We are what we call ourselves. We are not \u201cshady and unreliable\u201d(Yariba) and we must not accept names that are given to us by our historical adversaries.\n\nAny \u201cOmo Karo Jire\u201d or \u201cOoduwan\u201d who continues to call himself a \u201cYoruba\u201d is lost and does not know the implications of what he is doing to his own people. He is simply affirming and confirming an insulting label which has deep sinister, mystical and spiritual connotations.\n\nThe word \u201cYoruba\u201d did not even exist until the 18th century and even then most of the tribes of the South-West, including the Oyo\u2019s, rejected it due to its origin and meaning. The word \u201cYoruba\u201d is alien to our culture and not known in the Anago language. Ooduwans please take note.\n\nThe first time the word \u201cYoruba\u201d was used as a generic term for ALL the people of the South-West Nigeria was in the 19th century by Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther. He did us a great disservice there given the fact that it derives from the word \u201cYariba\u201d, which the Fulani used to describe our people.\n\nThe meaning of the word \u201cYariba\u201d is \u201cusurper, deceitful, shady, treacherous, cheating usurer and double-dealing bastard\u201d. Once again, I reject that name.\n\nThe good people of the South-West Nigeria are \u201cAnagos\u201d or \u201cOmo Karo Jires\u201d or \u201cOmo Oluabis\u201d or \u201cOoduwans\u201d and we are NOT \u2018Yaribas\u2019 or \u2018Yorubas\u2019.\n\nI, Femi Fani-Kayode, a proud Ife, an Anago, an Aku, an Omo Karo Jire, an Omoluabi, an Ooduwan and a son of Oduduwa, will NEVER answer to the name \u201cYoruba\u201d again or use it to describe my people. We are better than that.\n\nREAD ALSO: CBN to recover N36bn loans from North-East farmers\n\nThe British named our nation \u201cNigeria\u201d meaning \u201carea of darkness\u201d and the Fulani named our ethnic nationality \u201cYariba\u201d.\n\nPut together, this means \u201ca group of deceitful, shady, treacherous usurpers and bastards from an area of darkness\u201d.\n\nIs it any wonder that we are still in servitude and bondage? What a terrible combination. We have been snared by our names.\n\nMay God open our eyes, may He help us and may He deliver us! We must start helping ourselves by rejecting these deeply demonic names, labels and terms.\n\nWe are FAR better than the baggage that those horrific names carry.\n\nIf the Lord can change the name of Jacob (meaning \u2018shady character, rogue and trickster\u2019) to Israel (meaning \u2018God contends\u2019), then He can change ours too.\n\nIf Jabez (meaning \u2018one who was born in sorrow\u2019) can call on the Lord to break the chains and remove the limitations of his name, to enlarge his coast and to bless him abundantly, so can we.\n\nRemember: We ARE what we call ourselves!\n\nI read the contribution of a northerner by the name of Farouk Kperogi to this debate on Facebook and I marvelled at his attempt to befuddle the issues and misrepresent my assertions. Surely, even intellectual dishonesty and historical revisionism has its limits.\n\nTo the sons and daughters of Oduduwa and all other southerners, who are my primary concern, I say do not be fooled: the Fulani have been using the words \u201cYariba\u201d and \u201cNyamiri\u201d for over 200 years.\n\nQuite apart from that, I would appreciate it if someone would please tell this Kperogi that it would be better for him to read what I wrote than to go out of his way to purposely and maliciously misrepresent me.\n\nHe claims that \u201cit was reported\u201d that I said \u201cYariba\u201d and \u201cNyamiri\u201d were FULANI words.\n\nNeedless to say I NEVER said or wrote that and if indeed it was reported in such a way in any medium, then that is nothing but a case of pernicious falsehood, perfidious misrepresentation and pre-meditated and specious mendacity.\n\nWhat I wrote was that the Fulani GAVE and USED those words to describe the people of the South-West and South-East respectively. Contrary to his assertion, I did not say they were Fulani or Hausa words. Giving or using a name or a word does not necessarily mean that that name or word is native to the language of the user and giver. This appears to me to be obvious and basic logic.\n\nThe name could derive from another race or language entirely and you can still use it in yours as a term to describe others. This is especially so when you seek to demean and malign them.\n\nAs regards the meaning of the words, I would suggest that Kperogi reads a little more widely and he will discover what those that coined them actually meant. It is simply a question of historical and literary research.\n\nIf you disagree with me on an issue or we have divergent opinions, it is no big deal but at least quote me accurately and do not misrepresent or misconstrue what I wrote.\n\nMore importantly, if you insist on criticising me or disagreeing with me on an important matter like this, you would do well to actually read what I wrote yourself and not rely on what \u201cwas reported\u201d or what others told you that I wrote or said.\n\nThis surely is a given when it comes to even the most basic, elementary and rudimentary form of intellectual discourse.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Imo community moves to abolish caste system\n\nThe truth is that in his post, Kperogi has confirmed virtually everything else that I wrote about this matter other than the mischievous and erroneous assertion that I claimed that the two words in question were from the Fulani or Hausa language. I repeat, I never made that assertion.\n\nHe also dropped the ball when he said that \u201cNyamiri\u201d was a word that was created during the Nigerian civil war. This is not true. The word has its origins in the Igbo language but its subsequent corruption, bastardisation, condecending connotation and insulting usage by the Fulani commenced as far back as the 18th century.\n\nNeedless to say I stand by every word that I wrote in my article titled, \u201cWe Are Sons And Daughters of Oduduwa And Not Yorubas\u201d.\n\nI urge Kperogi and those that share his complex and inexplicable disposition to read it with a clear mind and actually learn something. I wish him well.\n\nPermit me to conclude with this. One day, all truth, no matter how bitter or hard to accept, will no longer be hidden and ignored and men will no longer be blinded by their own ignorance, pride and folly.\n\nTo be concluded\n\nChief Fani-Kayode is a former Minister of Aviation\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.
