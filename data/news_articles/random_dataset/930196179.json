He disappeared about a month after Colombia\u2019s Supreme Court ordered him freed while the charges were investigated. U.S. officials were also investigating Mar\u00edn when he went missing.\n\nBoth men reappeared in August 2019 when they released a video showing them back in their olive-green uniforms alongside a small cadre of dissidents, accusing Colombia\u2019s government of failing to uphold the peace accord. Colombian officials allege Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is providing them shelter.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice charged Hern\u00e1ndez and Mar\u00edn alongside Maduro and a dozen other Venezuelan officials in March with conspiring to export cocaine to the U.S.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the FARC has used drug trafficking to finance their terrorist activities and partnered with corrupt Venezuelan elites to threatened (the) United States and our allies,\u201d DEA Acting Administrator Timothy Shea said. \u201cWe hope these increased rewards will encourage those with valuable information to contact the DEA.\u201d\n\nThe decision by Mar\u00edn and Hern\u00e1ndez to return to arms was a significant blow to Colombia\u2019s peace accord. Both former commanders with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, had helped negotiate the deal. They were two of the group\u2019s most visible leaders promoting the accord after it was signed.\n\nIn their absence, the FARC\u2019s remaining leadership has continued pressing forward with the agreement\u2019s implementation. The former rebels have created a political party and embarked on new lives as civilians. But they also remain under threat; the United Nations recorded 77 murders of ex-combatants in 2019.\n\nThe Associated Press"}}
