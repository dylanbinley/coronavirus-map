Within 20-30 years, increases in freight will outgrow the port\u2019s capacity, which necessitates a move. Aucklanders also want and will be getting better access to their waterfront, which is already happening and will progressively happen over coming decades.\n\n\u201cHowever, where the port moves to and when needs better analysis than what the Working Party was able to provide. It needs to be evidence-driven, robust and independent of any vested interests.\n\n\u201cI welcome the initial analysis by Treasury and the Ministry of Transport in the reports released this morning. These confirm many of the concerns we have expressed.\n\n\u201cLike Treasury, we were frustrated that the data underlying the Working Party\u2019s assumptions was not available to be tested. Some of those assumptions were wildly inaccurate, for example that there would be $4.3 billion in savings on road infrastructure costs. That was factually incorrect, and the savings do not exist.\n\n\u201cThere was also an assumption of 70% rail use from Northport which has been described as very optimistic.\n\n\u201cOfficials say that scenarios outside of Northport have been overlooked and prematurely rejected. I concur with that.\n\nThe recommendation of officials is that based on the evidence provided the case for a full move to Northport has not been made. I also agree with that.\n\n\u201cMost particularly I welcome the recognition by Treasury and the Ministry of Transport that the private property rights of Aucklanders who own the Ports of Auckland cannot be dismissed as the Working Party implies.\n\n\u201cAucklanders have invested over $600 million in their port and our rights should not be treated differently from the rights of any other shareholders in terms of confiscation of our assets,\u201d Phil Goff said.\n\nContent Sourced from scoop.co.nz\n\nOriginal url"}}
