Ortega, Daily Mail, February 2, 2020\n\nAn aspiring rapper in Chicago was sentenced to 99 years in prison after he and a hitman he hired to gun down his mother were found guilty of murdering the woman.\n\nQaw\u2019mane Wilson, who raps under the name \u2018Young QC\u2019, was sentenced by Judge Stanley Sacks, in Cooks County, on Friday.\n\nSacks also gave the hitman, Eugene Spencer, a similar punishment, 100 years in prison for the slaying of Wilson\u2019s mother, Yolanda Holmes, in 2012.\n\n\u2018The word is \u2018matricide\u2019, meaning murder of one\u2019s own mother,\u2019 the judge said as he stared down from the bench at Wilson and Spencer, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.\n\nSacks noted what had become obvious during the case, was that Wilson, who was 23 at the time Holmes was shot dead in her North Side apartment, was doted on by his mother when he ordered her death.\n\n\u2018Whatever he wanted, his mother gave to him. A car. A job. One could say he was spoiled. She gave Qaw\u2019mane life, and it was his choice to take it way from her,\u2019 the judge said during the man\u2019s sentencing.\n\nProsecutors said Sencer and Wilson\u2019s girlfriend went to Holmes\u2019 apartment in Uptown on September 12, 2012, to carry out the murder so that the rapper could empty her bank accounts.\n\nRecords showed the woman\u2019s son withdrew nearly $70,000 from her accounts in the months after her death, and spent the money on flashy clothes and adding gull wings to a pricey Ford Mustang muscle car she had given him.\n\nIn an video that Wilson filmed and posted online, he is seen throwing cash on to his supporters and saying that he knows how to \u2018give back\u2019 to his fans.\n\nWilson, now 30, with long dreadlocks pulled back into a topknot Friday, nodded as the judge delivered the sentence.\n\nWhen asked if he had anything to say before Sacks made his ruling, Wilson was brief, the Times reports.\n\n\u2018I just want to say, nobody loved my mother more than me,\u2019 he said. \u2018She was all I had. That\u2019s it.\u2019\n\nRelatives said that Holmes\u2019 murder and the charges against her son nearly a year later had \u2018torn a hole\u2019 in the close-knit family.\n\nSondra Jackson, Holmes\u2019 aunt, attended each day of the week-long trial last year with a group of family members, and had always sat on the side of the courtroom behind prosecutors, reports the Sun-Times.\n\n\u2018After all this, we still don\u2019t understand why he did it,\u2019 Jackson said at the time. \u2018We are just happy to have this over\u2019."}}
