No one has a special status and it will be the time for everyone to seek a mandate from the people based on their performance,\u201d he said at the signing ceremony in Mogadishu.\n\n[read_more id=\"2\" more=\"Read full article\" less=\"Read less\"]\n\n\u201cThis law marks the culmination of a long process which started with the Baidoa Agreement in 2018 where we discussed the form of elections. It has the blessings of all stakeholders including the Federal Member States,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe presidency said Mr. Farmaajo was joined by the Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire, the Deputy Prime Minister Mahdi Guleid, and Speakers of the Federal houses led Speaker of the House of the People, Hon. Mohamed Mursal Sheikh Abdirahman and the Speaker of the Upper House Hon. Abdi Hashi Abdullahi.\n\nFarmaajo praised the 10th Parliament for playing their crucial roles and working tirelessly to prepare the critical document.\n\n\u201cI applaud Members of the 10th Parliament and their Speakers for spearheading this historic process and making significant contribution to our Republic by executing their legislative duties diligently and independently. Both houses have passed 20 significant bills while displaying teamwork and putting country first without giving attention to selfish interest and political affiliations. We have witnessed harmonious collaboration between all stakeholders and I am truly proud to see all our constitutionally independent institutions working hand in hand for the benefit of our people and our country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are honored to share the credit with our previous leaders; H.E Sheikh Shariff and H.E Hassan Sheikh who left a legacy and contributed to our nation\u2019s democratic process which began with the selection of representatives by elders to our next step which will now return the mandate and power to the individual voter. My administration is now proud to ensure our nation participates in a free, fair, transparent and democratic election.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo our citizens, the people of Somalia, especially our youth who make a large percentage of our population, the power to vote for your candidate of choice is in your hands. Let\u2019s keep away from tribalism and divisive politics. We are on a democratic path to move our nation away from selfish interests, bloodshed and loss of property.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo our MPs, have faith in your people, in the election process and the nation. It is now upon the elections body to partner and engage all stakeholders such as the civil society, MPs, the government, the public, Regional administrations, and friends and partners of Somalia.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, President Farmaajo has urged the citizens to prepare for the commemoration of the country\u2019s 60th Independence Anniversary which will be held later this year.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant year for our nation, and I ask every one of us, each and every citizen of Somalia, wherever you are, to join the celebrations and do something for our Republic be it planting a tree and volunteering to remind ourselves the greatness of our republic and work towards bringing it back.\u201d\n\n[/read_more]"}}
