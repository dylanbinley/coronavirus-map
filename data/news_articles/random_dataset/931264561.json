But it\u2019s a bit of a minefield for investors looking at dividends at the moment. Nearly half of FTSE 100 companies have cut or suspended their dividends so far this year.\n\nThe good news is that there are still well-known companies that are paying dividends to investors. They also make for really good investments. This is why I\u2019ll be adding cheap dividend-paying stocks to my ISA to profit from this market dip in the years to come.\n\n5G is here \u2013 and shares of this \u2018sleeping giant\u2019 could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air\u2026 And if you click here we\u2019ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G\u2019s full potential...\n\nA big dividend-paying stock\n\nVodafone is the first share I\u2019d look to add to my ISA. A high-yielding investment trust I own, Merchants Trust, has recently bought-in to the shares, which I find reassuring.\n\nIn its latest factsheet, the manager said: \u201cWe have become more positive on the prospects for UK telcos in recent weeks. Share prices fell sharply in the first quarter of 2020 taking valuations to more attractive levels and despite telecommunications revenues being far more resilient than many other sectors to the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe shares appear to offer dividend growth potential as well as a high current dividend yield. The yield is 6.4%. This gives me confidence the stock could help me make money.\n\nA safe dividend\n\nAdmiral Group (LSE: ADM) is actually a company I\u2019ve previously sold shares of. But I\u2019d happily add them back in to an ISA, especially if the price drops back a bit \u2013 even if only by 5% or so. The shares combine a potentially very profitable combination of a reasonable P/E at 15 and a decent dividend yield at 4.2%.\n\nAs a car insurer, I think Admiral will be less affected by coronavirus than most other companies. As motorists are required by law to insure their cars, it\u2019s a safe business to be in compared to many. The group has even been in a position to refund customers who are driving less because of the virus.\n\nThe group is also more than just a UK car insurer. It owns comparison sites and has operations in many countries. These all provide the potential for more growth and diversified earnings and I think this bodes well for creating value for shareholders.\n\nRewarding shareholders nicely\n\nMy third pick for adding to my ISA is Tesco (LSE: TSCO), another company that as a defensive share has had a \u2018good\u2019 crisis. Demand for food will never go away making the company very robust. With the improvements made under departing boss Dave Lewis, I think the grocer looks in a strong position for ongoing growth. This should feed through into sustained shareholder returns.\n\nTesco has recently announced it will be pulling out of under-performing Poland. The business has been sold for \u00a3181m. This further helps Tesco streamline its business and focus on competing with the discounters in the UK \u2013 its main market.\n\nWith a P/E of 12 and a dividend yield of 4% I think Tesco shares also offer an attractive combination of cheap income. This makes it another dividend-paying stock I\u2019d add to my ISA."}}
