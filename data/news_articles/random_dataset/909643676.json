However, it wasn\u2019t long after their move when Usluca was offered a job as a paralegal, and she turned to her husband and asked, \u201cWhat about you? I want you to do something!\u201d\n\nIn that moment, Tanriguden decided that it was the right time to share his one-of-a-kind collection of unusual finds from all corners of the globe.\n\n\u201cEverything was in storage that I had collected over the years. Lots of bits and pieces wherever I traveled...Europe, the Far East,\u201d he said. Tanriguden opened his shop three years ago, and just recently moved it to its current space.\n\nThe layout of Re-Unique is sort of like a map of the world, with Italy being the first stop. Tanriguden pointed to a bell topped by a decorative angel with outspread wings hanging on the wall.\n\n\u201cThis is the oldest piece I have, dated 1740. I found it in Rome at a Vatican shop. It was from an orphan school with the Latin inscription, \u2018If you touch me, you can hear me.\u2019\u201d\n\nOrnate mirrors and paintings from Florence, brightly colored Capodimonte (Italian porcelain) figures, and an 1800s hand-carved horse tricycle are part of the eclectic mix to browse.\n\nThere are painted wood chests, silk screens with vivid Far Eastern motifs and sculpted sea animals, bronze elephants from India, and gold and red Chinese Foo dog statues.\n\nTanriguden also carries treasures from his home country of Turkey.\n\n\u201cThe cushions on these couches are typical of Turkish design from Anatolia. They are handmade embroidered rug cushions and bamboo on the inside so the shape of the couch does not change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very old style from the mid-18th century that is still seen today in villages.\u201d\n\nThe back of the shop is reserved as an art gallery, currently featuring works by East Haddam/Key West resident Ineke Dorjee deRaad and one time Old Lyme resident Mary Connors, whose paintings depict idyllic scenes of the town.\n\nShowcasing all of Tanriguden\u2019s finds is his wife\u2019s job; she said she enjoys her role in designing the space and displays.\n\n\u201cI absolutely love decorating the store. I created four separate and distinct design flavors: the Shoreline, the Asian/Far Eastern, the European Classic and the Moroccan.\u201d\n\nShe said she also delights in meeting people who come in the store.\n\n\u201cIt has been fun meeting people from all over the country leading to delightful conversations,\u201d she said. \u201cThe best is having them come back to visit our store again and becoming friends.\u201d\n\nWith such a diverse mix of inventory, Tanriguden said that he is always looking for new pieces through his personal contacts, auctions and large exhibitions.\n\n\u201cAn item has to be really unique and eclectic. When I see something I love, I buy it.\u201d In addition to searching for one-of-a-kind objects for the shop, he will track down a special piece for a customer.\n\nFor Tanriguden, traveling the world and bringing a piece of each locale home is a labor of love.\n\n\u201cOld objects always have a story, always something behind them. I investigate and learn. I love that.\u201d\n\nRe-Unique Art and Antique Center is located at 891 Boston Post Road, Old Saybrook."}}
