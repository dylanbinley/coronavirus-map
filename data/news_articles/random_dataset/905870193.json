It was supposed to conclude the cruise on 15 February in Yokohama, Japan.\n\nThe cruise line statement said all passengers were \u201chealthy, and despite erroneous reports, there are no known or suspected cases of the coronavirus on board, nor have they ever been.\u201d\n\nHowever, on Thursday morning Sihanoukville\u2019s police chief told the Khmer Times 20 passengers showed signs of illness (stomach upsets and flu-like symptoms). Blood samples sent to Phnom Penh for laboratory checks subsequently showed that none of the tested passengers had contracted the Covid-19 virus. That cleared the way for all the remaining passengers to begin disembarkation and transfer to charter flights due to depart from Phnom Penh airport at the weekend.\n\nThe WHO director-general Tedros Ghebreyesus praised Cambodia for taking in the Westerdam, a US-based cruise ship registered in the Netherlands.\n\nHe noted that it had been turned away from ports in Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Guam, Taiwan, and Thailand despite having no sick patients on board.\n\nHe said Cambodia\u2019s response was \u201can example of the international solidarity\u201d that the WHO has encouraged throughout the health crisis. WHO has consistently advised against excessive travel bans.\n\nThe Westerdam\u2019s South China sea cruise unravelled after it left Hong Kong 1 February when countries suspended travel from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau due to concerns over the spread of the Covid-19 virus."}}
