Although she spent a night in jail and appeared before a judge in court, the King County prosecutor declined to charge her as neither Heard nor Van Ree were residents of Washington.\n\n\"Ms. Heard lied about this domestic violence incident under oath, saying 'it was a trumped-up charge and it was dropped immediately for being such.' Ms. Heard also subsequently tried to minimize this arrest for domestic violence to the media, claiming that the police officers were 'homophobic' and 'misogynists,'\" the declaration added.\n\nHowever, the arresting officer, Beverly Leonard, who happened to be a lesbian activist, said later in a statement on Facebook: \u201cI am so not homophobic or mysoginistic [sic]! The arrest was made because an assault occurred (I witnessed it) and the parties were in a domestic relationship.\"\n\nActors Amber Heard (L) and Johnny Depp attend the 8th Annual HEAVEN Gala presented by Art of Elysium and Samsung Galaxy at Hangar 8 on January 10, 2015 in Los Angeles, California (Getty Images)\n\nAlthough not much is known about Heard's relationship with Van Ree, the 'Aquaman' actress came out as gay when she attended the 25th anniversary of GLAAD (Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) in 2010, two years after she started dating her partner.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cI mean, you\u2019d have to be crazy not to want to go out with her!\u201d\n\nThey secretly got married at some point in their relationship and began a \"domestic partnership.\" Heard even changed her last name to Van Ree before changing it back after their split in 2012.\n\nFours years after their breakup, Van Ree opened up about the 2009 incident in an interview with E! News, where she defended her former partner.\n\n\"In 2009, Amber was wrongfully accused for an incident that was misinterpreted and over-sensationalized by two individuals in a powerful position. I recount hints of misogynistic attitudes toward us which later appeared to be homophobic when they found out we were domestic partners and not just \u2018friends.\u2019 Charges were quickly dropped and she was released moments later,\" she said.\n\nShe had added: \u201cIt\u2019s disheartening that Amber\u2019s integrity and story are being questioned yet again. Amber is a brilliant, honest and beautiful woman and I have the utmost respect for her. We shared 5 wonderful years together and remain close to this day.\u201d\n\nIf you have a news scoop or an interesting story for us, please reach out at (323) 421-7514"}}
