No casualties have been reported on either side.\n\nIn an interview published on Hamas's official website Thursday, the group's leader Ismail Haniya rejected calls to disarm and said the group would \"continue in our strategy of building up force, including in the West Bank and Jerusalem, until we can liberate our homeland.\"\n\n\u00a9 2020 AFP"}}
