Industrial accident do happen but this does not not mean that industry is your enemy. GOI is working day and night to industrialize country and any ham handed effort to intimidate or wrong these industries. This reminds me, closure of Posco plant in Odisha and copper plant in TN. This cost lots and lots of jobs, Foreign exchange earnings etc. Guilty should be punished but tone and tenor of authorities should not be adversarial. At least 10 people die daily in Mumbai because of Local trains. You do not close these trains."}}
