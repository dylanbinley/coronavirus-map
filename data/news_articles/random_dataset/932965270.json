The indigenous organisation APIB has logged at least 332 Covid-19 deaths, and 7,208 coronavirus cases across 110 communities. \u201cWe are facing extermination,\u201d said its executive coordinator, Dinamam Tux\u00e1. Since the virus particularly impacts elder people, the unexpected death of tribal leaders is sweeping away knowledge and wisdom that is difficult to replace.\n\nBelow is an article published by The Guardian\n\nWhen Bep Karoti Xikrin fell ill with Covid-19, he refused to go to a hospital.\n\nThe 64-year-old chief of a Xikrin indigenous village in Brazil\u2019s Amazon was plagued by headaches and fatigue and struggled for breath. But according to his daughter Bekuoi Raquel, he was afraid that if he were admitted to hospital he might never return.\n\nInstead, he died in his village \u2013 and with him, was lost decades of knowledge and leadership.\n\n\u201cHe knew so much about things we haven\u2019t even experienced,\u201d said Bekuoi, 21. \u201cEveryone admired him. He was very loved.\u201d\n\nAs Brazil\u2019s confirmed overall death toll from Covid-19 passes 50,000, the virus is scything through the country\u2019s indigenous communities, killing chiefs, elders and traditional healers \u2013 and raising fears that alongside the toll of human lives, the pandemic may inflict irreparable damage on tribal knowledge of history, culture and natural medicine.\n\nThe Munduruku people alone have lost 10 s\u00e1bios, or wise ones. \u201cWe always say they are living libraries,\u201d said Alessandra Munduruku, a tribal leader. \u201cIt\u2019s been very painful.\u201d\n\nThe victims include prominent figures such as Paulinho Paiakan, a Kayap\u00f3 leader who fought alongside rock star Sting against the Belo Monte dam.\n\nThe indigenous organisation Apib has logged at least 332 Covid-19 deaths, and 7,208 coronavirus cases across 110 communities. \u201cWe are facing extermination,\u201d said its executive coordinator, Dinamam Tux\u00e1.\n\nIndigenous leaders such as Tux\u00e1 say the government of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, is failing to protect the country\u2019s 900,000 indigenous people \u2013 many of whom live in small communities, where dozens often share the same house.\n\nTux\u00e1 said Brazil\u2019s Funai indigenous agency has taken too long to send emergency food kits to people isolating in their villages, forcing them to risk infection by traveling to nearby towns for emergency government payments.\n\nFunai said it had delivered 82,000 basic food kits and 43,000 hygiene kits.\n\nSome leaders even blame government health workers for bringing the virus. Katia Silene Akr\u00e3tikat\u00eaj\u00ea, 51, a chief from the Gavi\u00e3o tribe in Par\u00e1 state, believes she caught Covid-19 after a government health team visited their village to give flu vaccines.\n\n\u201cEveryone got sick from there on,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Brazil\u2019s biggest reserve \u2013 the Yanomami \u2013 four people have died from Covid-19, and 146 cases of coronavirus have been detected. The tribe has previously been decimated by epidemics of measles and flu, and many now fear the coronavirus is being spread by 20,000 wildcat miners \u2013 or garimpeiros \u2013 who are overrunning the reserve.\n\n\u201cThe garimpeiros are like measles, they don\u2019t want to leave,\u201d Dario Kopenawa, vice-president of its Hutukara Yanomami Association, told the UOL site. His father, indigenous leader Davi Kopenawa, is with one of several Yanomami groups self-isolating deep in the forest.\n\nOn 5 June, federal prosecutors warned of federal government neglect in protecting indigenous people from the pandemic. Celebrated indigenous leader Raoni said Bolsonaro was \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of the coronavirus to eliminate indigenous people.\n\nThe government\u2019s indigenous health service, Sesai, said it had sent 600,000 items of personal protection equipment and spent \u00a311m fighting Covid-19. On Tuesday the Brazilian congress approved a law aiming to guarantee emergency help for indigenous people that needs presidential approval.\n\nA fifth of Brazil\u2019s indigenous people live in the enormous state of Amazonas, whose capital, Manaus, was recently overwhelmed by the virus \u2013 but has the only intensive care beds in the state.\n\nEdney Samias, 38, a chief of the Kokama people in the Amazon region of Alto Solim\u00f5es, 1,000km from Manaus, said that Covid-19 has killed 57 people in his tribe \u2013 including his own father.\n\nGuilherme Samaias, 64, is thought to have contracted the disease when he travelled to a nearby town to collect an emergency aid payment. When he became ill, he was promised a medical airlift to Manaus, but it never materialized, Samias said.\n\nKokama people who fall sick now stay in their villages, self-medicating with a tea made of Amazon plants, lime, ginger, garlic \u2013 and aspirin. \u201cMixing our medicine with the white man\u2019s medicine,\u201d Samias said.\n\nFunai has delivered some food supplies, but Samias said that the aid kits are only available to indigenous people who live on officially demarcated reserves \u2013 and are too small for large families. \u201cThe whole tribe is hungry,\u201d he said.\n\nIn one hard-hit Amazon region, indigenous people and NGOs have worked with local government to develop their own solutions.\n\nAfter high infection rates were detected in the town with Brazil\u2019s highest indigenous population, S\u00e3o Gabriel da Cachoeira, an emergency committee of ISA, local officials, government doctors and indigenous association Foirn was formed.\n\nWhen Funai food baskets failed to arrive, indigenous groups and local Funai officials raised money to buy and distribute their own. The Brazilian NGO Health Expeditionaries has set up temporary infirmaries around this vast region with room for hammocks and oxygen concentrators to help patients from more than 700 remote communities without sending them to hospital.\n\n\u201cOur effort is to make community isolation work, to reduce transmission and consequently, serious cases,\u201d said Guilherme Mon\u00e7\u00e3o, a Sesai doctor. Now Sesai is adapting the model for other regions.\n\nThe government should cooperate more with civil society, said Marivelton Barroso, Foirn\u2019s president. \u201cNobody goes it alone in this region,\u201d he said."}}
