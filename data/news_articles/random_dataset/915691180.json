To understand the question, we have to revisit Rev. Wright and Obama\u2019s decision to bring on political disciples David Plouffe, Joe Biden and Eric Holder.\n\nThe airline also flies to and from Brussels, Frankfurt, London and Vienna in Europe, and Chicago, New York City and Washington D.C. in the U.S., with a stopover in Lom\u00e9, Togo.\n\nWhen operating at full capacity, Ethiopian Airlines flies to 106 international and 23 domestic destinations and is an important airline for many Africans traveling to and from the continent.\n\nI am shocked that you @Mtca_somalia are allowing the Ethiopian airlines to continue flying to North Somalia\n\n\n\nRemember this: You will be held responsible if the outbreak of the Coronavirus disease increases in North Somalia and in the rest of Somalia https://t.co/xy5PqIrocy \u2014 MyWorld (@KingYusufYusuff) March 26, 2020"}}
