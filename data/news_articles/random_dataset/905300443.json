The risk to the UD community remains low. Out of an abundance of caution, the University is sharing this preliminary information.\n\nThe students, who do not reside on campus, are currently in isolation at an area hospital, safe and receiving care. The Division of Public Health is coordinating testing with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results are expected in the coming days.\n\nAt this time there are no confirmed cases of this novel coronavirus in Delaware.\n\nIt is understandable to feel uncertain or anxious during a public health event, and we need to remember to care for one another and not make assumptions about others\u2019 perceived symptoms or any characteristics of identity. This is a time for the community to support one another. Your compassion and empathy for each other makes a difference.\n\nInformation about the COVID-19 situation is available online on the University\u2019s special coronavirus webpage.\n\n\n\nDr. Tim Dowling\n\nMedical Director, Student Health Services"}}
