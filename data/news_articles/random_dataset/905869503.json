The only problem is that they\u2019re supposed to be playing jazz.\n\narticle continues below\n\nA student heads for the front door.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d bandleader Vinny Golia calls after him. \u201cIf not, we\u2019re sending dogs after you.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a threat, it\u2019s an invitation to the rest of the musicians: two upright bassists, a drummer, vibraphone player, three trumpeters and trombonists and five saxophonists, to relax. There\u2019s also a tuba.\n\n\u201cThe world needs more tuba players,\u201d Golia tells them from his stool perch. \u201cIt\u2019s got something to do with gravity and the rotations of the Earth.\u201d\n\nToying with a cane, Golia surveys the band. He\u2019s composed 500 pieces for ensembles (not counting the ones for really large ensembles.) He won LA Weekly\u2019s award for best jazz musician in 1999. He\u2019s played with countless jazz greats as well as the Los Angeles Philharmonic. But what he wants right now, is for the band to breathe.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re really straining,\u201d he tells them. \u201cYou have to relax and let it swing.\u201d\n\nHe tells them about Dizzy and Sonny Stitt, Bob Brookmeyer and Dizzy.\n\nThey play it again.\n\nHeads start nodding. Sneakers and Blundstones tap. Now it\u2019s like Tarzan with a vine or an electoral district equally divided between liberals and conservatives. It swings, baby.\n\nAs students filter out of the rehearsal room, Capilano University jazz instructor Jared Burrows invites Golia into his inner sanctum on the second floor.\n\n\u201cOnly the most important people get to go in here,\u201d Burrows intones.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll wait outside,\u201d Golia volunteers.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s been Golia\u2019s home for decades but his voice still crackles with New York.\n\nHis parents were hard working blue collar types, he remembers, who used the Bronx Zoo for his after-school care.\n\nHe\u2019d spend hours going from cage to cage and drawing the animals that fascinated him.\n\n\u201cWhile I was painting I started listening to a lot of music,\u201d he says, citing Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis and John Coltrane.\n\nSoon he was fascinated with musicians.\n\nHe was working as a teacher but he was also going to clubs and drawing great jazz players. He did the abstract, colourful cover for Chick Corea\u2019s Song of Singing album where it looks like the hep is about to jump off the sleeve onto your face.\n\n\u201cI have that record and I never knew,\u201d Burrows says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no name on it. They didn\u2019t give me credit,\u201d Golia explains.\n\nIn the early 1970s Golia had album covers but no album to call his own. However, the money he made from album covers was enough to buy his first instrument: a soprano saxophone.\n\n\u201cWhich is, in retrospect, kind of stupid,\u201d he says, noting the finicky nature of the soprano sax.\n\n\u201cMost people start with alto which I didn\u2019t get to until, like, a few months ago,\u201d he adds.\n\nAround that time he wound up as a substitute teacher at a reservation in New Mexico. He was there with a lawyer who also had a practise of writing out Ravi Shankar solos and playing them on bass.\n\nAs luck had it, the regular teachers were never sick.\n\n\u201cSo I wound up practising all day,\u201d he says.\n\nHe started playing with the lawyer/bass player and it wasn\u2019t long before he was touring with players like John Carter and Bobby Bradford (\u201cI\u2019m still learning from Bobby Bradford,\u201d he confides) occasionally dropping into Vancouver and playing the Glass Slipper for an appreciative audience.\n\n\u201cI saw Vinny play when I was a kid,\u201d Burrows says, drawing a laugh from Golia.\n\nGolia brings something unique to jazz, Burrows says.\n\n\u201cVinny\u2019s perspective is, I would say, several degrees further away from our usual thing,\u201d he says. That forces students to examine their perspectives on music and how to play his compositions.\n\n\u201cI was watching a bunch of light bulbs go on today,\u201d Burrows remarks.\n\nFor Friday\u2019s show, the band is set to open with a swing piece, something on the familiar side.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that people are used to. So, you give them a little bit of a carrot and then you yank it,\u201d he chuckles.\n\nBurrows, noting he\u2019s promoting the show, is hoping for a good crowd.\n\n\u201cNo offense to North Shore dwellers but it\u2019s not a concert town, per se,\u201d he says.\n\nBack in the rehearsal room a trumpeter sips what looks like an ice cappuccino and Golia\u2019s head snaps up from his chart.\n\n\u201cYou need a strong drink for this one, huh?\u201d\n\nHe turns to the drummer and invokes James Brown\u2019s great drummer Clyde Stubblefield. For this piece, he tells him, we need something \u201cin the funkish range.\u201d\n\nThe drummer nods.\n\n\u201cDo you want it to be a half-time kind of feel?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what you come up with, young man.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re about to run through a few more songs when Burrows announces they only have five minutes.\n\nGolia appraises the band. They\u2019re swinging now.\n\n\u201cFive minutes? OK, let\u2019s play really fast.\u201d"}}
