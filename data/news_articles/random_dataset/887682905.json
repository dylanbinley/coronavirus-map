Jim Justice\u2019s family.\n\nThe motion to dismiss argues that the contract the plaintiffs claim it breached never existed in the first place.\n\nThe defendant, which is part of the U.S. Department of the Interior, contended that the federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and the plaintiffs fail to state a claim.\n\n\"This is a purported breach-of-contract action,\" the Nov. 12 memorandum of law in support of the motion to dismiss stated. \"The allegations arise out of Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with, or appeal, the abatement requirements of fifteen cessation orders issued by OSMRE\u2014including two imminent harm cessation orders\u2014and failure to pay over $4.2 million in civil penalties and reclamation fees.\"\n\nThe defendant argued that the plaintiffs allege the department entered into a binding contract with them to settle the $4.2 million for $250,000.\n\n\"Plaintiffs ask this Court to issue a declaratory judgment that a contract exists and then to enforce its terms,\" the memo states. \"No such contract, however, exists or ever existed. And this Court does not have the authority to enforce such a contract even if it did exist.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Justice companies said they had done everything they were supposed to do as per the agreement.\n\n\"The company has complied with the plan that was agreed to with OSM and many of the key issues have been addressed. The company continues to work on the outstanding items and will do so until they are completed,\" the spokesperson said in an interview with The West Virginia Record.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in May in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia at Roanoke.\n\nWeekly Newsletter Sign-up and get latest news about the courts, judges and latest complaints - right to your inbox.

The plaintiffs are represented by Aaron B. Houchens, Richard A. Getty, C. Thomas Ezzell and Marcel Radomile of The Getty Law Group.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Justice; A&G Coal Corp; Chestnut Land Holdings LLC; Bluestone Coal Corporation; Dynamic Energy Inc.; Frontier Coal Company; Justice Energy Company; Kentucky Fuel Corporation; National Coal LLC; Pay Car Mining Inc.; Premium Coal Company; S&H Mining; and Tams Management Inc.\n\nU.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia at Roanoke Case number: 7:19-cv-00381"}}
