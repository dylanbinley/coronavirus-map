It\u2019s also extremely hot all the time.'\n\nWhile 'Giant_Anteraters added: 'I went to LA for vacation last winter, and somehow, I had this impression that the \"Hollywood Walk of Fame\" meant that it would be a hotspot for celebrities to hang out and \"walk\" down the boulevard.\n\n'So I specifically went to the Walk of Fame to see if I could find some celebrities. And yep, the only people I spotted were strangers handing out CDs.'\n\nAnother Californian city, San Francisco, was named as overrated by 'shesagoatgirl', who explained: 'It's super expensive to live, streets smell like p***, high taxes, terrible traffic.'\n\nOne Redditor said they were left feeling miserable after visiting Times Square on New Year's Eve\n\nOne Redditor, 'eDgAR', called out Times Square, saying it was especially overrated on New Year's Eve.\n\nHe said: 'Went there a few years with my girlfriend, her brother, and his girlfriend.\n\n'It was miserable.
