Li does not explain how he reconciles this form of \u201cdemocracy\u201d with the actual definition of democracy.\n\nThe Global Times regularly publishes columns that claim Chinese communism is a righteous form of \u201cdemocracy\u201d superior to that of the West, in which \u201cchaos\u201d \u2013 defined as free and fair elections, public political debate, and general freedom of expression \u2013 reign. China, it contends, enjoys \u201charmony\u201d that comes from individuals not having the ability to critically think about government publicly without facing criminal retribution.\n\nLi Junru began his column lamenting that Americans have a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d of Chinese \u201cdemocracy\u201d based on accurately equating all communism to the deadly, brutal form of communism applied in the former Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of U.S. citizens, including many politicians, have never been to China. All they know is that the country is led by the Communist Party of China (CPC). And the image of the CPC in their minds is represented by the one of the Soviet Union, whose dark side was frequently exposed during the Cold War,\u201d Li wrote. Unlike the Soviet communists, Chinese communists allegedly \u201cpersist in seeking truth from facts, the mass line, and independence. Learning about the CPC with an understanding of the CPSU will certainly lead to misunderstandings. The key to understanding China is to understand the CPC.\u201d\n\n\u201cMass line\u201d is a Maoist term used for the first wave of communist purging of society of all deemed \u201cunnecessary.\u201d Dictator Xi Jinping revived the \u201cmass line\u201d after years of being dormant in a 2014 speech.\n\nLi then goes on to argue that China is a \u201cmulti-party system,\u201d but one where all parties are \u201cled\u201d by the Communist Party. This form of democracy, he argued, is superior to American democracy where parties with differences in ideology vie for public support because it keeps politics more uniform, which Li appears to consider a more favorable trait than free politics.\n\nThe article continues by claiming that \u201cit is not true\u201d that China does not hold meaningful elections. In reality, Chinese people can vote for a variety of Communist Party-approved candidates, all of whom share the same beliefs, Li argued.\n\n\u201cRegardless of electoral democracy\u2019s advantages, including transparency and competitiveness, it has flaws that should not be ignored. The biggest problem is that it cannot truly reflect the essence of democracy,\u201d Li claimed. \u201cElectoral democracy generally follows the rule that the minority is subordinate to the majority. Although everyone has the right to vote, only some voters\u2019 appeal can be heard.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cconsultative democracy,\u201d which does not grant the people the right to govern themselves, Li claimed the Chinese find a superior freedom. He concludes the piece by applauding China for helping \u201cimprove\u201d democracy.\n\nChina\u2019s \u201cconsultative democracy\u201d has resulted in thousands, if not millions, of arrests for political dissidents in the country in the seven decades of communist rule, and tens of millions of deaths as a result of manufactured famine, extrajudicial dissident purges, forced infanticide, and murders committed to illegally sell live organs. Yet the Global Times has persisted for years in arguing that Chinese people live in \u201charmony\u201d and that they enjoy more rights than their American counterparts.\n\nIn 2016, following President Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory, the Times declared that Chinese observers now understood \u201cthe fragility of Western democracy,\u201d as their leaders are not predetermined and anyone who wins the hearts of voters can win an election.\n\n\u201cFrom the protests against Trump, Chinese people found the schism in the U.S. is becoming increasingly serious and are questioning the reliability and universality of the Western democratic system,\u201d the column argued.\n\nIn this election cycle, the Global Times has branded the robust competition among Democrats to win that party\u2019s nomination \u201cpathetic,\u201d rather than a positive indication of how many Americans feel compelled to participate in their own governance.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}}
