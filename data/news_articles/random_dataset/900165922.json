But the summit has already ruffled feathers with several countries in the region fuming at being left out, including Greece, Morocco and Tunisia.\n\nLibya has been torn by fighting between rival armed factions since a 2011 Nato-backed uprising killed dictator Moamer Qadhafi. Most recently, Sarraj\u2019s troops in Tripoli have been under attack since April from Haftar\u2019s forces.\n\nClashes killed more than 280 civilians and 2,000 fighters and displaced tens of thousands, until a fragile ceasefire backed by both Ankara and Moscow was put in place on January 12.\n\nAt follow-up talks in Moscow, Sarraj agreed to a permanent truce but Hafter walked away without signing the deal.\n\nIn the latest apparent ceasefire violation, GNA forces on Sunday accused Haftar\u2019s militia of opening fire on them in southern Tripoli.\n\nAlthough Sarraj\u2019s government is recognised by the UN, powerful players have broken away to stand behind Haftar -- turning a domestic conflict into what is essentially a proxy war in which international powers jostle to secure their own interests.\n\nAlarm grew after Erdogan ordered troops to Libya early January to bolster Sarraj, while Russia has been accused of sending in mercenaries to help Haftar as Moscow seeks to extend its influence in the region.\n\nUnderlining the stakes involved, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said \"we have to make sure Libya doesn\u2019t become a second Syria.\"\n\nSarraj meanwhile issued a plea for international \"protection troops\" if Haftar were to keep up his offensive, echoing a similar call by the EU\u2019s chief diplomat Josep Borrell.\n\n\"Such a protection force must operate under the auspices of the United Nations. Experts will have to advise who should participate, such as the EU or the African Union or the Arab League\", he told Die Welt newspaper on Sunday.\n\nErdogan has repeatedly urged Europe to stand united behind Sarraj\u2019s government, warning that Tripoli\u2019s fall could allow jihadist groups like the Islamic State or Al-Qaeda to regroup.\n\nHe has also cautioned that further unrest could prompt a new wave of migrants to head for Europe.\n\nFor Turkey, a fall of Sarraj\u2019s GNA could jeopardise a maritime boundary agreement the parties signed. With so many regional rivals and competing interests facing off, Wolfram Lacher, Libya expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, was sceptical about the chances of a Berlin breakthrough. \"Nobody believes that the states involved will really respect the arms embargo\" after ignoring it for years, he said."}}
