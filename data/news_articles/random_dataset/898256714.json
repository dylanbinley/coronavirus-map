Among the protestors was Juan Cole, a professor at the university who had some harsh words for the president, as well as Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n\u201cWe have a mad bomber in the White House,\u201d Cole said at the protest, which was titled \u201cNo War With Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have somebody who\u2019s erratic. We have a secretary of defense who\u2019s a lobbyist for the arms industry. We have a secretary of state who is a Kansas oilman.\u201d\n\nCole accused Trump, Esper, and Pompeo of \u201cmaking war\u201d on the Middle East and the climate. He continued to blast Trump and his administration, claiming he has \u201cput the pillow over the baby of Iran\u201d at a time when the country was about the be \u201cwelcomed into the world community.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a rogue government,\u201d Cole said.\n\nA student that attended the protest and introduced Cole to the stage claimed that Americans have \u201clearned their lesson\u201d from previous conflicts in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cWhat we are here for is to put an end to U.S. imperialism, and to build an anti-war movement in this country that is strong enough, such that the United States cannot go around doing things like what it just did.\u201d\n\nWestern media used to accurately report that Soleimani led Iran's fight against ISIS. When Trump assassinated him, those same outlets portrayed him as the world's number one terrorist.

But the Trump administration\u2019s justification of the Soleimani \u2060attack \u2014 that he was an imminent threat targeting the U.S. \u2060\u2014 has been questioned.\n\nReports suggest that the Islamic State \u2060\u2014 not Soleimani \u2060\u2014 was responsible for all U.S. soldier deaths in Iraq since 2014. In addition, impeachment allegedly played a significant role in Trump\u2019s decision to authorize the attack. He reportedly told GOP associates after the strike that he felt pressure to deal with Soleimani from GOP senators, who he would need support from in the upcoming Senate trial.\n\nThe Hill reports that a second attack on an Iranian official took place on the night of Soleimani\u2019s assassination, suggesting the move could have been part of a broader strategic plan as opposed to a reaction to an imminent danger. The mission targeted Yemen-based financial backer Abdul Reza Shahlai, but it was ultimately a failure."}}
