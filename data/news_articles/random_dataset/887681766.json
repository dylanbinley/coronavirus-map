The company still hasn\u2019t posted any updates about the status of eight crew members kidnapped by the pirates while the ship was anchored off Benin.\n\nUgland, based in Grimstad on Norway\u2019s southern coast, reported on its website that the company had replaced the missing crew members and planned to leave Benin over the weekend. An Ugland official flew to Benin to help crew members who wanted to be reunited with their families in the Philippines.\n\n\u201cPlease understand that we can\u2019t comment further,\u201d \u00d8ystein Beisland of Ugland wrote in a text message to newspaper Dagens N\u00e6ringsliv (DN). It remains unclear where the kidnapped crew members are being held or whether ransom demands have been made. The captain of the vessel Bonita was among those seized during the attack.\n\n\u201cUgland continally evaluates the safety situation in areas where our ships operate,\u201d the company reported shortly after the attack. \u201cIn light of the ongoing situation we are evaluating whether our ships shall sail in this area.\u201d The company has earlier said it was doing \u201ceverything it could\u201d to bring its missing crew members to safety, all of whom are citizens of the Philippines.\n\nnewsinenglish.no staff"}}
