This situation would make Venezuela vulnerable and would be a peril for the United States.\n\nThe regime is attempting to cancel Venezuela\u2019s debt with China. The same had happened with Citgo when Maduro provided 49.9% of his shares to Rosneft as a guarantee.\n\nEst\u00e1 tomando fuerza la hip\u00f3tesis de que#PDVSA pueda ser entregada a la petrolera Rusa #ROSNEFT por no poder honrar la deuda que han adquirido desde la llegada de Ch\u00e1vez y Maduro a la presidencia seg\u00fan opini\u00f3n del Ing.

They have already demanded that Venezuela reduce the personnel because currently, there are more than 70,000 people on the payroll, and \u201cit is not feasible to create a company that is moderately competitive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are already reviewing ships and facilities to determine the actual situation of the Venezuelan oil industry. Based on that, they should close the pact. The process should not take long because there is an emergency,\u201d said sources linked to the industry.\n\nAccording to El Nacional, the regime is seeking legal means to hand over control of PDVSA to Rosneft without labeling the process as an act of privatization since that would require the approval of the opposition-majority National Assembly under Venezuelan law.\n\nAlthough the Russian news agency TASS replicated the news, Sputnik, another Russian state media, pointed out that according to Rosneft, these are rumors. \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on rumors,\u201d a Rosneft spokesman told Sputnik.\n\nPreviously, the Russian state-owned oil company announced that PDVSA had reduced its debt from 1.8 billion USD to 1.1 billion USD in the second quarter of 2019. According to economist Alexander Guerrero, Venezuela restructured its debt with Russia with a payment of monetary gold amounting to 666 million USD.\n\nThe million-dollar debt that Venezuela owes Russia is the main link between the two countries. In June, the Chavista regime gave Russia two new gas fields, granting it 100% control of the project and all rights to the extracted gasoline.\n\nThrough the Russian state-owned company, Moscow has acquired part ownership of several Venezuelan oil fields: Petromonagas (40%), Petromiranda (32%), Petroperij\u00e1 (40%), Boquer\u00f3n (26,6%), Petrovictoria (40%), and Junin 6 (more than 30%).\n\nIt is not outlandish to think that Russia wants to expand its presence in Venezuela through the petroleum route. The regime has already channelized its cash flows through petroleum sales via Rosneft, the company responsible for PDVSA exports.\n\nIt is noteworthy that in December 2016, it was revealed that Maduro secretly mortgaged the Citgo refinery to Russia for a million-dollar loan. If Citgo or PDVSA default on the payment, Rosneft could end up owning important oil refineries and pipelines in the United States.\n\n\u201cA genius move\u201d\n\nFrancisco Monaldi, a researcher at the Baker Institute of the University of Raleigh, told the PanAm Post that although it is unclear whether Russia would be willing to make million-dollar investments in PDVSA, he believes that Vladimir Putin\u2019s government has played a \u201cgenius game.\u201d Russia is benefiting in every way amid the unprecedented crisis in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cThe Russians have been taking control of the Venezuelan oil industry, especially with exports. They also control the two main gas fields and manage shares in different refineries in Venezuela,\u201d he added.\n\nThe specialist said that the American oil companies\u2019 license to operate in Venezuela would expire next week. In that case, the Russians could also seek to appropriate the gaps that companies like Chevron would leave behind.\n\n\u201cIf foreign companies like Chevron leave Venezuela, the oil industry could virtually fall into the hands of the Russians. They will find the opportunity to expand, although it is not yet clear how they would do it,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cThe Russians have taken over the oil sector to collect their debt and are also the best positioned during the political transition in Venezuela. They have made a brilliant move. If Maduro remains in power, Russia will retain \u201cownership\u201d of Venezuela\u2019s oil sector, and if another president takes over, Russia will have the option to sell all its assets and make a lot of money. It is a genius move in any case,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRussia is in no condition\u201d\n\nTo clarify the situation regarding the possibility that PDVSA could fall entirely into the hands of Russia, PanAm Post interviewed economist Jose Toro Hardy, who was a senior member of PDVSA\u2019s board of directors before Hugo Chavez came to power. Toro pointed out that the Russian economy is badly hit, and it is difficult for them to decide whether to assume all the burden that the Venezuelan state represents in its current \u201cdestroyed\u201d state.\n\n\u201cPDVSA has destroyed itself. The company used to produce 3.5 million barrels in 1998; today, it produces about 640,000 barrels a day. Production is falling rapidly,\u201d he said.\n\nThe economist explained that although Maduro\u2019s regime may be desperate to find a way out, Russia may not be in a position to take full control of the Venezuelan state. \u201cRussia today is a poor country with missiles,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe regime knows perfectly well that what it is doing is no longer viable and is probably desperate to find a way out. However, it forgets that Russia is most likely not in a position to help. Russia itself is in a major economic crisis. Its GDP has fallen by 6%. The country has severe geopolitical problems at its borders. It faces sanctions from Europe and the US. Moreover, it is in an acute economic situation,\u201d said the specialist.\n\n\u201cAlthough Russia is not in a good financial condition, companies like Rosneft still try to look for good businesses in Venezuela. But it is a very different thing to pretend to take over the Venezuelan oil industry, which would also violate the Venezuelan Constitution. The balance of the debt with Russia is a tiny fraction of total PDVSA debt. So it would be a sort of treason to the homeland to try to exchange the Russian debt for control of PDVSA,\u201d he said."}}
