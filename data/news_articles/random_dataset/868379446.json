A change to the Saskatchewan Advantage Scholarship \u2014 also amounting to around $3 million dollars \u2014means there may not be as much funding available to students.\n\n\u201cWhat the Government of Saskatchewan has done is changed that from a flow-through \u2014 where they send money to the university and we apply it as scholarships to student accounts \u2014 to a needs-based bursary,\u201d he said.\n\nThat scholarship formerly provided all new Saskatchewan Grade 12 graduates up to $500 per year for four years if they enrolled in a Saskatchewan post-secondary institution.\n\nHe said the university is working to raise funds for more scholarship money.\n\nUniversity of Regina Students\u2019 Union president Victor Oriola said he\u2019s encouraged the university is investing in scholarship money for students, but said the shortfall could be attributed to students not knowing financial support is there.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the expected versus the actual disbursements, it could speak to, perhaps \u2026 (the university) didn\u2019t have enough applications to give out all the bursaries,\u201d said Oriola. \u201cPerhaps they need to invest a bit more in awareness campaigns so that people know these bursaries are available to them.\u201d\n\nWhat Oriola is most concerned about, however, is the increasing cost of education, including a 2.8 per-cent hike in tuition the U of R announced in May.\n\nBRANDON HARDER / Regina Leader-Post\n\n\u201cWhile I am concerned \u2026 that people didn\u2019t utilize the aid available to them to its fullest capacity, my number one (concern) is that several people are so dependent on that aid in the first place.\u201d"}}
