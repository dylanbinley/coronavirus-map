He said the city was notified about the grant on Monday.\n\nBirk said city is responsible for paying a percentage of the officers\u2019 salary for the first three years with city being responsible for the officers\u2019 salary and benefits in the fourth year.\n\nMy hope is that we can accept the grant,\u201d Birk said. \u201cWe could do a lot of positive things in Middletown for COP duties and allow other officers to do more discretionary patrols.\u201d\n\nMiddletown police has 68 officers, including the chief, and has three vacancies. He said a patrol officer\u2019s test will be given at the end of June and another in July.\n\nIf city officials decide to accept the grant, it will be up to Middletown City Council to give final approval."}}
