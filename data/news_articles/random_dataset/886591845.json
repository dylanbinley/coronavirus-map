I really love business but I didn\u2019t love learning in the classroom.\u201d\n\nSo, while Whitty was completing her degree at Saint Mary\u2019s University, she was looking for ways to learn on the job. That\u2019s when her former employer and newly minted PropertyGuys.com real estate franchise owner in Truro reached out with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nIn 2009 The Canadian Youth Business Association and PropertyGuys.com Canada had teamed up to launch the youth entrepreneurship challenge. The prize? A PropertyGuys.com franchise.\n\nSoon, Whitty says she was \u201cin the school of Daina,\u201d referring to her friend and mentor Daina Hernden.\n\n\u201cDaina called me and said, \u2018Mallory, someone\u2019s going to be the winner of this franchise. You need to enter.'\"\n\nBut there was one tough barrier Mallory faced.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything,\u201d she said laughing.\n\nAfter a 40 minute phone call, Whitty was hooked.\n\n\u201cMy full-time job was to win that contest,\u201d said Whitty. \u201cThere was never a possibility in my mind that I wasn\u2019t winning.\u201d\n\nContestants had to campaign for votes in their community by making videos, giving presentations at schools, and generally hustle for support. If contestants made it past the first round, they would need to develop a business plan and go through a job interview. Whoever was left after that, would face the dragons on the popular CBC show Dragons' Den.\n\nWhitty, along with two other finalists, was flown to Toronto where the final test was to make their case in the den as to why they should be handed the keys to a new franchise. Whitty was only halfway through her presentation when celebrity businesswoman and investor Arlene Dickinson gave her a ringing endorsement.\n\n\u201cIn the middle of my presentation she picked up a stack of money, came over to my podium, slammed it down, and said, \u2018you\u2019ve got my vote.'\"\n\nBut the trajectory of Whitty\u2019s life, it seems, was set on a different path that even Dickinson\u2019s vote of confidence couldn\u2019t sway. Whitty lost the competition.\n\nShe returned to Nova Scotia, finished her degree at SMU, all the time smarting from the loss. She wanted the franchise. In particular she wanted this franchise \u2013 Pictou, Antigonish and Guysborough \u2013 and Whitty's dream job was still up for grabs if she wanted it bad enough.\n\n\u201cSo, I got a loan and bought the franchise like anyone else.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, Whitty became the youngest PropertyGuys.com franchise owner in Canada. With her new job and new responsibilities, she had a new goal \u2013 win franchise of the year.\n\n\u201cI have these memories of driving from New Glasgow to Antigonish and saying to myself, \u2018someday, it\u2019s not going to be like this, someday people will be calling me instead of me calling them, and someday I\u2019m going to be franchise of the year.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t going to be easy, but at the time, Whitty was too revved up to worry.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s something really special about youth entrepreneurs,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd a lot of it comes from being very na\u00efve. I had no idea about the uphill battle that was before me, but I had no choice but to put one foot in front of the other.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, Whitty attended the PropertyGuys.com annual conference and awards night in Mexico, where she was named the top franchisee in Canada.\n\n\u201cIt was incredible,\u201d she beamed. \u201cI had gotten married that year too and I would compare that to my wedding day; it was so meaningful to me.\u201d\n\nAs for the contest that she lost nearly 10 years ago.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s not a bad thing to have the wind taken out of your sails a little bit,\u201d she said. \u201cLosing that franchise was the best thing to ever happen to me. It took me years to admit it, but I never would have worked as hard as I did if this had been handed to me.\u201d"}}
