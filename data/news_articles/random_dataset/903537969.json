Gen. Daryl Bohac, the Nebraska National Guard\u2019s adjutant general, hasn\u2019t yet been notified whether Camp Ashland has been selected as a quarantine site, Ingalsbe said. He added, however, that \u201cWe are planning as if this is going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe federal Department of Health and Human Services is working on a plan to bring Americans back to the United States, UNMC Chancellor Jeffrey Gold said Saturday. The travelers most likely would be employees of the federal government or private companies who have tested negative for coronavirus. They would have recently visited Wuhan or other cities where people have come down with the virus.\n\nNearly 20,438 people around the world have been infected with the coronavirus, most in China, the World Health Organization reported Monday. The coronavirus so far has resulted in 425 deaths, all but one in China.\n\nEleven cases have been confirmed in the United States, nine of whom had traveled to the Wuhan area, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Nebraska has had no confirmed cases."}}
