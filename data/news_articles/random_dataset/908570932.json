The two films and the series of photographic portraits on view in \u201cLand of Dreams\u201d convey a shift in focus for Neshat, who has often used her work to look back at her native Iran.\n\nNow, her steely gaze is fixed firmly on her adoptive home, the US.\n\nNeshat told me this new chapter is somewhat \u201cactivist\u201d in tenor. \u201cThe rise of white supremacy and fanaticism in the US is very real,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2014and I say we because I think I am American as well\u2014are at risk of a major transformation.\u201d\n\nThe artist\u2019s highly stylized black-and-white films follow a young Iranian art student, Simin, as she travels across the US taking portraits and asking her subjects about their dreams. Along her journey, Simin has doors slammed in her face, but she\u2019s also welcomed, which Neshat said echoes her own experience of America.\n\n\u201cI feel that all the time that I\u2019ve been in this country, I\u2019ve been mostly treated really well,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have also felt racism, and that\u2019s one of the reasons I think I wanted to make the film, because the United States of America is changing.\u201d\n\nMore than 60 portrait photographs are also on view, which Neshat captured as she traveled across New Mexico going door-to-door offering people $20 to photograph them. She chose New Mexico because of its diverse population, which comprises white Americans as well as a large Hispanic immigrant contingent, African American communities, and Native American reservations. It is also one of the poorest US states.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of a portrait of America, a portrait of immigrants,\u201d Neshat said. \u201cWhat you see 20 years from now may be very different. There is an idea of \u2018purifying\u2019 the white race, and of building walls, which is a phenomenon that is fundamentally anti-American.\u201d\n\nLand of Dreams\n\nThe second film in the exhibition, The Colony, involves an absurd twist, revealing Simin as an Iranian spy who reports American dreams back to a dystopian Iranian colony in the mountains. As the film progresses, Simin begins to emotionally identify with her American subjects\u2019 dreams.\n\n\u201cDreams are very similar regardless of where you come from,\u201d Neshat says. \u201cOur nightmares and anxieties are similar. They are fears about aging, about death, war, and displacement.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Iran, Neshat experienced the rise of radical Islam in the years leading up to the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Since she emigrated to the US in the 1990s, her work has often raised questions about how her country was ideologically transformed in such a brief period.\n\n\u201cI always thought of Iran as having had absolutely the most backward and unbelievable transformation, a resurrection of something that in this time and age seemed impossible,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it happened, and now they have been in power for 40 fucking years, and people are brainwashed.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, she is alarmed by the dominance of Fox News in the US, and says \u201cthere is a risk of fascism in America.\u201d She also sees \u201cfrightening similarities\u201d between the rise of white supremacy in the US, the UK, and parts of Europe.\n\nBut the art market, she said, can blind artists to their social responsibilities.\n\n\u201cThey are more concerned with making commodities, and the whole art world is so dominated by the market that artists are often very ambivalent,\u201d she said. \u201cI sometimes feel bad saying this, because to be honest, I\u2019m a blue-chip artist showing in a commercial gallery. But we don\u2019t need to exist only to serve the museums and galleries and collectors.\u201d\n\nThe Colony\n\nLate last month, Trump introduced even tighter restrictions on foreign travel to the US. And even though she is an American citizen, Neshat expressed a growing concern that she may not be permitted to return to the States because her place of birth is marked on her passport.\n\nIn the early \u201990s, Neshat had a harrowing experience that still haunts her. After attempting to leave Iran, she was detained by officials for hours before being permitted to travel abroad.\n\n\u201cI was just devastated,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI knew I would never go back. As I entered the US on the other side, there was an African American immigration officer. And the first thing he said after he gave me back my passport was \u2018welcome home,\u2019 and I just started crying.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo me, that was the definition of America,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd that is changing.\u201d\n\nOver the next two years, Neshat plans to return to New Mexico to film a feature-length version of the films in the exhibition. She and her team have been working on the script for the past three years, and they are now in fundraising stages and plan to start shooting in May.\n\n\u201cI want to explore a greater balance in terms of the representation of the communities in America. I don\u2019t want it to be like poverty porn,\u201d she said.\n\nNeshat said she has considered leaving the US if Trump gets re-elected. But the artist is trying to stay optimistic.\n\n\u201cI think the issues are so immense and overwhelming that you could just lose yourself in despair. But I have an individual responsibility, and I see that as an artist, I have a minor, minuscule role as a communicator. And I will play that role.\u201d\n\n\u201cShirin Neshat: Land of Dreams\u201d runs through March 28 at Goodman Gallery, London.\n\nShirin Neshat will have a special exhibition as Photo London\u2019s Master of Photography in Somerset House, May 14 through June 21.\n\nFollow artnet News on Facebook:"}}
