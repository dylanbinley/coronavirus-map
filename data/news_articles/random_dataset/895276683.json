However, the minister claimed that the district administration of Gwalior has banned mining which is affecting the supply of sand in the region.\n\nCommenting on the minister's letter, BJP MLA Vishwas Sarang alleged that Imarti Devi seems to be giving protection to those people involved in illegal sand mining. He said that the minister should have raised some issues regarding the development of women and child.\n\nHowever, Congress spokesperson Narendra Saluja said that Imarti Devi has done nothing wrong and claimed that the construction work in the region is being affected due to the ban.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"}}
