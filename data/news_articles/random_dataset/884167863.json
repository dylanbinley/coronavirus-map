It was more than that. It was a sequence of failures that led to this day,\" she says.\n\nSamantha is traveling the country, sharing her experience, hoping to help people find solutions to gun violence and school safety.\n\n\n\nLocal students took her message to heart.\n\n\"I really liked what she said to take moderate steps and that's what blows the whole field open. People don't want to hear these extremes like, 'Get rid of all the guns.' They want to hear moderate things, that's what's going to bring the issue together,\" said Reynolsburg High School senior Lillith Bohler-Brewer.\n\n\"To meet in person someone who's been through your worst nightmare is daunting,\" said Columbus Alternative High School senior Benson Graham.\n\n\"I think what was so monumental about Florida is that these kids stepped up and said we're not going to be silent anymore,\" says Upper Arlington senior Grace Schooley.\n\nKids like Lilly who have turned 18 and are ready to have their voices heard this election.\n\n\"A kid that's about to vote, and that's important,\" she says.\n\nAlso important for Samantha is to keep speaking out to help find solutions, which she says is not just about guns.\n\n\"Having that understanding alone to face the problem with multiple solutions. There's not just one law, there's one thing you can say that will fix it,\" Fuentes says."}}
