He temporarily resides in Qatar and arranges his visits to other countries from there.\n\nThe Sultanate of Oman is one of the few Gulf countries that maintained good relations with Hamas and the rest of the Palestinian factions, before the relationship became strained due to Hamas\u2019 criticism of the Sultanate\u2019s attempt to reassure Israel.\n\nLast year, Hamas condemned Omani Foreign Minister Yusfu bin Alawi\u2019s statements at the World Economic Forum that was held in Jordan\u2019s Dead Sea region, during which he called on Arab countries to reassure Israel that it is not under threat in the Middle East\n\nDespite the tensions that also affected the relationship with the Palestinian Authority, the late Sultan managed to keep Oman neutral in most Arab disputes, even in the relationship between the Palestinians and Israel.\n\nTop Hamas official Ahmed Bahar also offered his condolences during a telephone conversation with the Chairman of Oman\u2019s Shura Council, Sheikh Khalid al-Mawali.\n\nBahar\u2019s office issued a statement indicating that he wished all the success to the new Sultan.\n\nThe statement recalled the historical positions of Sultan Qaboos towards the Palestinian cause, praising his role in serving Arab and Islamic issues. It stated that Mawali thanked Bahar, confirming the Sultanate\u2019s stances in support of the Palestinian people and cause.\n\nDuring Haniyeh\u2019s visit to Oman, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas also arrived to offer his condolences to Sultan Haitham.\n\nAbbas stressed that the Arab and Islamic worlds have lost an eminent leader who devoted his life to serving his country and people with wisdom and grace, praising what Oman has achieved during the rule of the late sultan and affirming the deep brotherly relations between the two countries and peoples.\n\nAbbas expressed his profound sympathy and heartfelt condolences over the death of the late Sultan.\n\nSultan Haitham thanked Abbas and the accompanying delegation for their sincere condolences.\n\nPalestine declared a three-day official mourning.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also offered his condolences to Oman on the death of Sultan Qaboos.\n\n\u201cHe was an incredible leader who worked tirelessly to promote peace and stability in our region. Under his leadership Oman became a central and advanced nation,\u201d he said.\n\nNetanyahu offered his condolences to the people of Oman, adding that he \u201cshares in their deep sorrow for the passing of Sultan Qaboos bin Said.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout a year ago he invited my wife and myself to an enormously important and stirring visit,\u201d during which he offered his help to push for peace in the region.\n\nNetanyahu congratulated Sultan Haitham and welcomed his statements that Oman\u2019s \u201cforeign policy and work for regional peace will be upheld.\u201d"}}
