Enshrined in law, this enables the UK to leave the EU on 31st Jan. pic.twitter.com/hzv2o2bMfr \u2014 Steve Barclay (@SteveBarclay) January 23, 2020\n\nThe 31 January split caps a remarkable political comeback for Johnson at one of the most difficult points in Britain's post-war history.\n\nHe quit former prime minister Theresa May's government in 2018 in protest at what he viewed as her pro-European separation terms.\n\nJohnson returned as May's successor in July last year and has since managed to negotiate his own deal with Brussels and regain the government's control of parliament in a risky early election last month.\n\nThe rest was a formality. Lawmakers barely debated the withdrawal agreement before passing it - even though critics called it worse for Britain than the one reached by May.\n\nJohnson will celebrate his victory by issuing commemorative coins and chairing a special cabinet meeting in England's pro-Brexit north on 31 January.\n\n'ABSOLUTE PRIORITY'\n\nJohnson will now be responsible for defining the terms on which Britain trades and shares everything from data to fishing waters with the remaining 27 EU member states.\n\nThe formal talks are not expected to begin until March but the war of words is already intense.\n\nJohnson insists that he will not extend the end-of-year negotiation deadline, while Brussels says a comprehensive deal will take much more time.\n\nThe UK government is also demanding the post-Brexit right to set its own rules on politically sensitive issues such as environmental standards and workers' rights.\n\nEU officials say that could give Britain an unfair advantage and are threatening to retaliate with tariffs and quotas that could do particular damage to the UK auto and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nBut some analysts believe this is the price Johnson is prepared to pay for delivering on voters' wishes to \"get Brexit done\".\n\nHe argues that this flexibility will help him reach a quick post-Brexit agreement with the United States and other nations that are growing much faster than the EU bloc.\n\nUS officials say they are eager to strike a deal with Johnson.\n\nA deal \"is an absolute priority for President (Donald) Trump and we expect to complete that with them this year,\" US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said ahead of his arrival in London this weekend.\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross added that Johnson would have an easier time with Washington than Brussels because \"there are far fewer issues between the UK and US.\"\n\nJohnson is expected to lay out his vision for the post-Brexit agreement with Brussels in a big policy address early next month.\n\n\"We'll be free to start having discussions with countries around the world, including the US\" at the same time as the Brussels talks, Downing Street said Wednesday."}}
