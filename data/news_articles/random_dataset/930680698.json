She appealed to journalists and Filipinos to continue fighting for their rights \u201cand hold power to account.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the court decision represents a major blow to press freedom there and should stand as an example of what can happen without laws like our First Amendment.\n\nThe International Press Institute called the charges against Ressa \u201ca transparent attempt to silence her and shut down Rappler in retaliation for its critical coverage of President Rodrigo Duterte and his administration.\u201d\n\nIn the days leading up to the verdict, Ressa said this: \u201cI think that this is not an easy time for being a journalist, but I think that the mission of journalism has become more important today than ever.\u201d\n\nPhil Robertson of Human Rights Watch this week called the verdict \u201ca frontal assault on freedom of the press that is critical to protect and preserve Philippines democracy.\u201d\n\nGranted, press freedoms don\u2019t mean the right to publish libelous, inaccurate stories. In America, libelous stories \u2014 those that are inaccurate and published with malice \u2014 can become the subject of civil suits, not criminal cases.\n\nIn this case, however, Ressa denies any wrongdoing and insists she was under attack by the government for years simply for doing her job.\n\nPhilippine officials deny that the criminal complaints against Ressa and Rappler were a press freedom issue, saying, rather, they arose only from violations of the law.\n\nAccording to the AP, Rappler\u2019s lawyers say the story was based on an intelligence report.\n\nThey also have indicated that laws were manipulated in order to bring charges against Ressa outside normal time limits for filing charges. Philippine penal law requires a libel complaint to be filed within one year. The businessman, Wilfredo Keng, filed his lawsuit in 2017 \u2014 five years after the story was published.\n\nA cybercrime law, which the Rappler journalists allegedly violated, also was enacted in September 2012 \u2014 four months after the story was published. Rappler\u2019s lawyers said Philippine penal laws cannot be retroactively applied.\n\nRappler, however, apparently had updated the story in February 2014 to correct a misspelled word but said it did not make any other changes. The Department of Justice, which brought the libel charges to court, contended that by updating the story, Rappler effectively republished the story online in 2014, an argument dismissed by the news site\u2019s lawyers.\n\nRessa, who has worked for CNN and was one of Time magazine\u2019s Persons of the Year in 2018, has accused the government of abusing its power and muzzling dissent.\n\nDuterte has openly lambasted journalists and news sites who report critically about him. ABS-CBN, the country\u2019s largest TV network, was shut down by the government\u2019s telecommunications regulator last month after its 25-year franchise expired, cutting off a major source of information on the COVID-19 pandemic and other critical news reports.\n\nIndeed, here in America, in the Mahoning Valley, we believe we fight battles of transparency and openness everyday.\n\nBut, it\u2019s journalists like Ressa who truly are on the front lines battling for press freedoms."}}
