Pat Roberts.\n\nMr. Pompeo has repeatedly said he is solely focused on his job in the Trump administration, telling CNBC in August, \u201cI think the only one not talking about my Kansas Senate run is me.\u201d But his frequent trips to Kansas this year have kept rumors alive that he might jump in. The filing deadline isn\u2019t until June.\n\n\u201cIt certainly stokes speculation and hope on the part of Kansas Republicans that we\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of him soon,\u201d said David Kensinger, a Kansas GOP consultant."}}
