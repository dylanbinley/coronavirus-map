It overheats my tiny brain and asks me \u201cspiritual\u201d questions I haven\u2019t begun to feel answers for. I don\u2019t fear it though, in fact, I am deeply in love with it, but I am a touch overwhelmed by it. Its expansive otherness, its core rasa, remind of the feeling I get when listening to my heroes; Cherry, Sanders, Sun Ra, Coltrane. It\u2019s that close to being *too* big.\n\nWhere to start then? Facts. Facts might help.\n\n\u201cRagmala\u201d is created by 40 odd musicians from Adam Rudolph\u2019s Go: Organic Orchestra (termed the \u201cfuture orchestra\u201d by Bennie Maupin) and Brooklyn Raga Massive (an artist community rooted in both traditional Indian and South Asian classical music, as well as cross-cultural Raga inspired music, hailed as the \u201cleaders of a raga renaissance\u201d by the New Yorker).\n\nGo: Organic Orchestra are a two-decade old, world concept/community of ever-changing musicians from everywhere: Mongolia, Nepal, Senegal, Ghana, Japan, Korea, Cuba, Iran, Mexico, Haiti, Argentina, Brazil, Jamaica; all expressing themselves within Rudolph\u2019s yogic framework, following no set instrumentation (8 bass players one night, none the next) but always leading to heightened exploration and discovery.\n\nRudolph\u2019s intent to push boundaries and reach for the new has urged him to design matrices and cosmograms to map out scales and intervallic patterns for the musicians, in place of the Western notational scores. His matrices derive from Schoenberg\u2019s \u201cmagic boxes\u201d but they don\u2019t conform to a formula, more flexible like a raga\u2019s scale/melody middle ground. He also applies a unique rhythm concept he calls Ostinatos of Circularity, \u201cIt\u2019s like the cycle references you would experience in Indian music,\u201d he says, \u201cwhere things orbit around, and then come together, like a circle.\u201d It combines the rhythms you would find in North Indian (he studied tabla for decades) and Middle Eastern music.\n\nThose 3 paragraphs of facts do indeed help, I think. They give a context for the globe-traversing blend of cross-continental sounds, underlain by the raga. They raise expectations for the array of instruments used; sitar, percussion (bata, caxixi, wood box surdo, mineiro, okonkolo, tabla and more), violins, didgeridoo, reeds, midrigan, the chromatic tambin, brass, guitar, bass, harp. They brace you for the deep, fearless, 20-track long listening experience that awaits. This ain\u2019t no background wash to do the pots to or a singalong for that long family drive to visit the folks. It\u2019s a serious piece of work. That doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t groove, it just means it needs to be listened to; it needs your focus.\n\n\u201cMousa Azure\u201d shows us the way to enlightenment with simple, surging circular patterns, Alice Coltrane-ish washes and stabs and Hassan Hakmoun\u2019s rejoicing, soaring Gnawa voice. \u201cRotations\u201d has an intense, hip, filmic, symphonic jazz groove that would have benefited any 60s thriller, so long as they could work in a loosely Eastern connection. \u201cEcliptic\u201d mesmerically plods, swells and deflates while, contrastingly, \u201cSavannahs\u201d rides hard and long, relentless and urgent, extending, propelling; needing to arrive at or escape somewhere.\n\n\u201cShantha\u201d is pure and brief, an empathic violin, guitar duo. \u201cWandering Star\u201d speaks of freedom and chaos with its percussive bed and sitar wash attacked by unexpected bursts of heavy strings and stinging guitar. \u201cAscent to Now\u201d is slick as, with a deep, angular, eyes-closed-head-nodding Strata-East groove and limpid flute skimming and skating.\n\n\u201cLamentations\u201d is achingly remote guitar, violin and bass, \u201cDialectic\u201d is percussive peace, \u201cThirteen Moons\u201d is bowed drama and \u201cReflective\u201d is, well, reflective. \u201cGlare of the Tiger\u201d initially surprises with its distorted guitar histrionics and metronomic beat and power before expanding into a tense strings/flute/guitar elegant diffusion. \u201cWe Grieve\u201d moans and weeps its grief in pockets of lament; didgeridoo, horns, strings all contributing their personal story of loss to the wake\u2019s congregation.\n\n\u201cTuriya\u201d is an uplifting, easy swinging, spiritual jazz/psych saunter. \u201cSyntactic Journey\u201d is the lightly-cacophonous meeting place of symphonic jazz and contemporary classical while \u201cSunset Lake\u201d is a gloriously trippy, trancy ascendancy to a higher state of awareness. \u201cAfrica 21\u201d brings the danceable funk, cleansed and stretched to the devotional by swirling horns, reeds and voices reaching ever, ever higher. \u201cGone to Earth\u201d is an unlikely brusque, visceral, guttural goodbye.\n\nAs I said at the top, this album is very big, very important, hard for me to fully assimilate. It\u2019s beautiful, expansive and majestic with a palpable deep connectedness but a virtuosic freedom too. It manages to forge a focused synergistic relationship between jazz, Indian Classical, West African etc. music while still expressing individual voices and creating a universal, not generic, whole. It is an authoritative step forward in the evolution of a truly global, celestial, cosmic \u201cworld\u201d music.\n\n\u201cThis album feels like the culmination of everything I\u2019ve been reaching for in my creative pursuits,\u201d says Rudolph \u201cWith this music I can hear the humanity of all these different musicians shine through, and their voices bring forth something that\u2019s never existed before.\u201d No wonder it feels so close to being *too* big.\n\nIan Ward"}}
