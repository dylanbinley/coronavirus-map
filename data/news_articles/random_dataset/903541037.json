The 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation followed suit Monday.\n\nThe plan, enthusiastically embraced by most Israelis, would deny the Palestinians an independent state and lead to a single \u201capartheid\u201d system in which the Palestinians living in the West Bank are second-class citizens, said Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit, who is Egyptian.\n\nIf Israel follows through on some of the plan\u2019s tacit promises \u2014 such as imposing Israeli sovereignty over at least a third of the Palestinian-claimed West Bank, including the crucial Jordan Valley \u2014 those steps will prove extremely difficult to reverse.\n\nSome people who have spoken to Kushner privately during the months of sputtering talks involving Israel and a number of Gulf States said his harsh rhetoric reflects his true feelings about Palestinians, which he kept at bay before unveiling the plan. He also may be hoping to apply greater pressure on the Palestinians.\n\n\u201cHe was probably holding off because he didn\u2019t want to totally close the door,\u201d said Daniel Levy, a former Israeli peace-plan negotiator and now director of the Middle East Project, a policy institute. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve put out the plan, what\u2019s the use of sugarcoating it with anyone?\u201d\n\nLevy was among numerous experts, diplomats, international officials and Democratic lawmakers who blasted the Trump-Kushner plan for failing to address Palestinian aspirations for nationhood and for making tough demands on Palestinians before they could even ask for a demilitarized state, while granting a near-full slate of concessions to Israel. The plan also denies the Palestinians a capital in East Jerusalem, offering instead a collection of slums to the east of the city.\n\nMany experts said the deal was a nonstarter for Palestinians, but were unclear whether Kushner realized that.\n\nPhilip Gordon, the White House senior official on the Middle East under the Obama administration now with the Council on Foreign Relations, suggested Kushner\u2019s language reflects his impatience and angry frustration.\n\n\u201cHe feels like he\u2019s invested three years in this. It\u2019s his moment of glory on behalf of the president. And (the Palestinians are) standing in his way,\u201d Gordon said.\n\nIan Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, which assesses global risks, said Kushner \u2014 scion of a family long dedicated to conservative pro-Israel causes \u2014 might have calculated that any sort of deal would be impossible if the Palestinians, especially under Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, were involved in the drafting stages.\n\nThe Palestinians formally broke off ties with the Trump administration and refused to engage in negotiations after Trump unilaterally reversed decades of U.S. and international practice by declaring the disputed holy city of Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel. He moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, part of which Palestinians want for their own capital, one of several pro-Israel steps Trump has taken.\n\n\u201cIf (the Palestinians) refuse to negotiate or come to the table now, the likelihood that this is all a fait accompli goes up a lot,\u201d Bremmer told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIt was in a television interview with Bremmer that Kushner made some of his stinging comments.\n\n\u201cLook, they played the victimhood card. Now, it\u2019s like they want their rights. They want a state,\u201d Kushner said Friday in comments aired on public television. \u201cBasically what we\u2019re saying to the Palestinians is put up or shut up.\u201d\n\nSpeaking a day earlier to veteran CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour, Kushner was dismissive of Palestinian leadership, whose members he is known to disdain.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t (agree to negotiate), then they\u2019re going to screw up another opportunity like they\u2019ve screwed up every opportunity that they\u2019ve ever had in their existence,\u201d Kushner said.\n\nKushner, through an aide, declined to be interviewed for this article, saying he was concentrating on television appearances for now. Senior administration officials, echoing Kushner, say his approach is one of pragmatism and realism. Trump said this could be the Palestinians\u2019 last chance for building a state, apparently because of Israel\u2019s march toward annexation of more lands claimed by the Palestinians.\n\nTrump unveiled the plan Jan. 28 at the White House before an overwhelming pro-Israel audience, including major GOP donors such as gambling magnate Sheldon Adelson. While the plan lays out a path to statehood for Palestinians, the result would not be a contiguous nation, would be surrounded completely by Israel and would be chopped up by Jewish settlements considered illegal under international law. The plan grants Israeli sovereignty over all of such settlements.\n\nThe timing of the release of the plan was questioned by critics who saw politics as the trigger. Netanyahu has been indicted on corruption charges, and Trump was in the middle of a Senate impeachment trial for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Both men are in the middle of reelection campaigns.\n\nSome of Kushner\u2019s rhetoric in the aftermath may be owing to a small power struggle with the U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, Trump\u2019s former bankruptcy lawyer and a longtime promoter of settlement expansion. Immediately after Trump unveiled the plan, Friedman announced that Israel could go ahead with annexation in the West Bank \u2014 a step that Kushner wanted to delay until after the upcoming Israeli elections March 2.\n\nKushner publicly contradicted Friedman, and Kushner was immediately attacked by Israel\u2019s far right and radical settler movement. Kushner countered with his negative comments and ultimatums about Palestinians.\n\nNetanyahu, apparently bowing to Kushner and loath to get in the middle of an intra-administration tiff, abruptly called off his plans to approve annexation in a Cabinet meeting Sunday.\n\n\u201cAnnexation is something that I think Ambassador Friedman is pushing, together with Netanyahu, in order to help Netanyahu get reelected,\u201d said Martin Indyk, former U.S. ambassador to Israel and former assistant secretary of state for near-eastern affairs. \u201cBut if Jared Kushner wants to keep the Arabs on board, he has to slow down the annexation. (So) there\u2019s an interesting tension there.\u201d\n\nKushner, a 39-year-old real estate developer, has also been caustically dismissive of the diplomatic history and peace plans that came before him. He\u2019s described previous efforts as \u201cfairy tales\u201d and \u201ctired old ideas\u201d that failed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been studying this now for three years,\u201d Kushner told Sky News Arabia. \u201cI\u2019ve read 25 books on it. I\u2019ve spoken to every leader in the region. I\u2019ve spoken to everyone who\u2019s been involved in this.\u201d\n\nKushner included in the plan what is described as a $50 billion investment scheme for Palestinians, although it is not specified where the money would come from. People who are familiar with Kushner\u2019s thinking say he approached the plan the way a business entrepreneur would: cash for concessions and compliance. But that approach ignores Palestinian history, nationalism and dignity, Gordon said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a92020 Los Angeles Times\n\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."}}
