They said that children could largely return to school with a low risk of infection or virus transmission, and asked Newsom to allow local authorities to grant reopening waivers for pre-K, elementary, and high schools.\n\nThe bishops noted their concern for both public health and \u201cthe broader health and development issues for our children if the state presumes to rely only on distance learning until a vaccine is developed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn-person learning,\u201d they said, \u201cespecially at the lower grades, provides emotional and social skills and supports that are crucial to early childhood development and the overall wellbeing of children which simply cannot be replaced.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in Texas where COVID-19 cases have soared in the summer, the state is granting religious private schools the freedom to decide for themselves how to reopen in the fall.\n\nTexas attorney general Ken Paxton said on July 17 that religious private schools in the state were exempt from the governor\u2019s orders for public schools, and that local governments could not close religious schools.\n\n\u201cThus, as protected by the First Amendment and Texas law, religious private schools may continue to determine when it is safe for their communities to resume in-person instruction free from any government mandate or interference,\u201d Paxton wrote.\n\nCatholic schools in the diocese of Dallas are still planning to fully reopen this fall, the superintendent announced on July 21; schools outside of Dallas County will reopen on August 19, while those inside the county are scheduled to reopen September 2.\n\nAround the U.S., dioceses and archdioceses are attempting to reopen schools safely but are having to take significant safety measures to do so.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Chicago plans to reopen its schools, but per its \u201cReopening with Trust\u201d plan, is requiring all students and staff to wear masks indoors, daily temperature checks by parents, and for a \u201ccohort\u201d or fixed group of students to remain together throughout the day to prevent as much interspersing as possible. Parents have the option of choosing remote learning for their children.\n\nMany schools are adopting a hybrid model for reopening, allowing parents who wish to keep their child at home to choose remote learning. In Louisiana, the New Orleans archdiocese is adopting such a model.\n\n\u201cWe also recognize that parents are the first and primary educators of their children and must make decisions based on their unique circumstances,\u201d superintendent Dr. RaeNell Houston said on July 21.\n\nTo the northwest, the Baton Rouge diocese said on July 22 that schools would reopen in early-to-mid-August, although schools would have to adjust their opening and closing times and classroom sizes to ensure the state\u2019s safety protocols.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, unemployment around the country soared and donations to churches plummeted. The Boston archdiocese said in June that it would be closing around 10% of its schools.\n\nCiting the \u201cdevastating\u201d impact of the pandemic on tuition payments and donations, and the \u201csignificantly low rate of re-registration for the fall,\u201d the Archdiocese of New York said earlier this month that 20 Catholic schools would be closing, and three schools would merge.\n\nFor the schools that are not closing, however, the superintendent Michael Deegan announced on July 13 that \u201cCatholic Schools are opening in September!\u201d\n\nDeegan clarified that, since most schools could not accommodate all students and staff at once, principals would plan for \u201cthree-day/two-day\u201d alternating week cycles for students, and remote learning for parents who wish.\n\nSome dioceses have not yet made a decision on reopening in the fall.\n\nIn Miami, Archbishop Thomas Wenski called it \u201cthe $100,000 question,\u201d according to local News 10 on July 21.\n\nFlorida is one of the states that has seen a later spike in virus cases, along with other states such as Texas and Arizona. While some states such as New York were hit hard by the virus in the early months of March and April, the number of new COVID cases in Florida soared in the summer, reaching a high of more than 15,000 new cases in a single day on July 12.\n\nElsewhere, other dioceses are completely or almost fully reopening on schedule.\n\nThe diocese of Fall River, Massachusetts announced on July 10 that all elementary schools would re-open in the fall for in-person learning, while the four high schools would make re-opening decisions on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn Denver, Archbishop Samuel Aquila said on May 29 that schools would be re-opening in the fall for in-person learning. The Denver Catholic reported on Friday that the archdiocese had partnered with regional health care provider Centura, which pledged to offer guidance and donating more than two million face masks for students and staff.\n\nThe 19 Catholic schools in the Charlotte diocese are also reopening with in-person instruction in the fall, and an option for virtual learning for parents who desire."}}
