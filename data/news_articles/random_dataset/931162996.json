The French Supreme Court said the bill\u2019s requirements\u2014that online posts, comments, photos, and other content deemed hateful by potential plaintiffs must be taken down within 24 hours of being reported\u2014would encourage social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, in their haste to avoid hefty fines, to remove perfectly legal speech. The provisions \u201cinfringe on freedom of speech, and are not necessary, appropriate and proportionate,\u201d the court said.\n\nIt also rejected a provision that required speech related to terrorism and child pornography be removed within an hour of being flagged. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Nadine Strossen, the John Marshall Harlan II Professor of Law, Emerita at New York Law School, and the French American Bar Association (FABA) urged the court in a brief submitted earlier this month to reject the bill.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the court for recognizing that citizens\u2019 rights of free speech and expression are paramount in a democratic society, and the bill\u2019s draconian deadlines for removal were so inflexible and extreme that those rights would be violated under France\u2019s constitution,\u201d said EFF International Policy Director Christoph Schmon. \u201cAny government effort to censor objectionable content must be balanced with people\u2019s rights to air their views on politics, the government, and the news. This bill failed to strike that balance. Its requirements would deputize platforms to police speech at the behest of the government, which is unacceptable in a free society.\u201d\n\nIn its filing with the court, EFF and its partners argued that the bill, known as the Avia Bill, would undermine European Union (EU) directives prioritizing users\u2019 free speech rights when dealing with Internet activities. Instead of taking steps to foster innovation and encourage competition so that social media platforms would improve their speech removal practices or lose customers, lawmakers in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are pushing legislation that makes online platforms the new speech police.\n\n\u201cAlthough the law\u2019s anti-hatred goal is laudable, human rights activists around the world agree that the more effective strategy is to counter hateful ideas through education, and ensuring that everyone has meaningful access to online resources,\u201d said Nadine Strossen, the John Marshall Harlan II Professor of Law, Emerita at New York Law School.\n\n\u201cThe Avia Bill would have forced social media platforms to single-handedly make an immediate determination as to the legal nature of the content,\u201d said Thomas Vandenabeele and Pierre Ciric, president and vice president, respectively, at FABA. \u201cWe are pleased that the French Supreme Court adopted the position expressed in our joint June 1 amicus brief, whereby those take down timing requirements will cause over-censorship of perfectly legal speech, and are therefore unconstitutional.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the European Union is gearing up for a major reform of key Internet regulation, the court\u2019s decision is also a strong call that lawmakers should better focus on how to put users back in control of their online experience,\u201d said Schmon.\n\nFor the decision: https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/2020/2020801DC.htm"}}
