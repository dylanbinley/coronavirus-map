On Friday however, her mother was told that Journei was no longer welcome at the school.\n\nJournei\u2019s mother, Deval Brockman, was reportedly contacted by a staff member at the daycare who basically told her that she wasn\u2019t here for shirt, asking that Journei doesn\u2019t wear it to school again.\n\n\u201cShe was like \u2018I don\u2019t like it, I don\u2019t agree with it\u2019, and I would prefer it if you didn\u2019t send her to school in it again,\u201d Deval tells Fox 16.\n\nJournei returned to school on a different date wearing a shirt with a fist on it, and it was unfortunately a wrap at that point as the teachers said the shirt was encouraging racism.\n\nDeval says that she reported the instance to the state and was told that as long as there was no profanity on the t-shirt, Journei could continue to wear it.\n\nThe school\u2019s directors apparently said something to Deval Brockman that didn\u2019t sit well with her.\n\n\u201cHe was like, \u2018I am not going to tell you how to raise your child but you need to reevaluate how you\u2019re parenting her.,\u201d\n\nDirectors of \u2018His Kids Preschool\u2019, Patricia Brown, addressed the issue to Fox16 in the following statement:\n\nDue to the threat of allegations and under the advisement of the council, His Kids Learning Center will only be releasing this written statement concerning The Brockman\u2019s:\n\nWe feel a childcare environment is not a place for a parent\u2019s political views to be addressed or played out, regardless of race.\n\nNeedless to say Journei\u2019s mother disagree\u2019s with the director\u2019s statement and says her daughter will not be returning to that school period.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not political, it\u2019s everyday life, It\u2019s all over the news. Right is right and wrong is wrong,\u201d Deval Brockman said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to a Christian led daycare, let\u2019s abide by the bible then.\u201d"}}
