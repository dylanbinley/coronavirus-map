The scenario is ever changing, but the general idea remains \u2014 whether it\u2019s one human-sized cockroach vs 100 cockroach-sized humans, or one elephant-sized snake vs 100 snake-sized elephants, it\u2019s always scary as fuck.\n\nThe sheer thought of having to battle a super-sized normally tiny creature is absolutely horrifying. So you can understand why everyone lost their minds when they found out that human-sized bats actually exist in real life.\n\nYep, no more need to imagine what a bat would look like if magic existed and they could be scaled up because in the Philippines, these monster human-sized bats are real.\n\nRuining absolutely everyone\u2019s day, @AlexJoestar622 decided to share photos of these horrifying behemoths to Twitter. And while they look and sound too bonkers to ever actual exist, it turns out that the giant golden-crowned flying fox is 100% real.\n\nJust like the photo says, the giant golden-crowned flying fox is native to the Philippines and has a wingspan of up to 1.7 meters or about 5\u20326\u2033. The species is endangered, and while fuck-off massive, pose no real threat to humans as they are frugivorous, like the common fruit bat.\n\nSadly despite \u201chuman-sized bat\u201d sounding cool as shit, Philippine locals have debunked the claims that the animal is that big. Locals compare the body size of the bat to \u201cmore or less like [that of] a medium-sized dog\u201d, while Animal Spot claim their bodies come to about 30cm on average.\n\nEven still, people got stuck on the whole \u201ca bat is taller than me\u201d thing by focusing on the monster\u2019s impressively large wingspan, resulting in both fear and awe of the giant golden-crowned flying fox.\n\nsome of y'all are really smaller than bats smh couldn't be me https://t.co/mWxP4hDryA \u2014 \ud83e\udd82 (@HAUNTEDYETI) June 25, 2020\n\nWhy can this bat dunk on me? https://t.co/smpfDTOCkc \u2014 Akilah Hughes (@AkilahObviously) June 25, 2020\n\nJeepers Creepers getting ready to wake up & add on to 2020 https://t.co/YiNgGf3iHK \u2014 Nelson G.
