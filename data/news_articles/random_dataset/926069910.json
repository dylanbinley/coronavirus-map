The Chinese Communist Party has broken its promises and killed Hong Kong,\u201d Benedict Rogers, the founder and chairman of Hong Kong Watch, told Breitbart London.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson must now speak out personally, robustly and clearly, mobilise the international community to act as one, and impose targeted Magnitsky sanctions,\u201d Rogers added.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: UK Must Not Be \u2018Bullied\u2019 by Chinese Communist Party, Says Last British Governor of Hong Kong https://t.co/xtvqmosE8E \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 7, 2020\n\nIn a stunning move, the United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, announced on Wednesday that the Trump administration no longer considers the Hong Kong to have a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d.\n\nThe change in classification means that the city will no longer be treated differently than mainland China \u2014 a move that could see massive implications for the city as a global trading and banking hub.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of 457 parliamentarians and policymakers from 32 countries, led by the last British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, have called on governments around the world to act against the \u201cflagrant breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration\u201d.\n\nThe Sino-British Joint Declaration guaranteed that the city would remain free from communist rule, under the banner of \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d, for fifty years after the United Kingdom handed over control of the former British colony to China in 1997.\n\nWith the passage of the national security law, critics claim that the CCP has utterly discarded any pretence of following the internationally binding agreement.\n\nOn Wednesday, thousands of Hong Kongers took to the streets to protest the security law, as well as legislation that would criminalise any \u2018insult\u2019 to the national anthem of China, the \u201cMarch of the Volunteers\u201c.\n\nShould the legislation pass, anyone who is found to have insulted the communist anthem would face fines of up to HK$50,000 (\u00a35,237/$6,449) and up to three years in prison, according to the BBC.\n\nThe police arrested at least 300 citizens during the demonstrations on Wednesday and were seen firing pepper pellets and spray at protesters.\n\n\u201cOnce again we have seen the courageous people of Hong Kong protesting in defence of their freedoms, and the Hong Kong police resorting to yet more completely disproportionate, indiscriminate, and outrageous brutality and injustice,\u201d Benedict Rogers told Breitbart London.\n\n\u201cHong Kong is in grave danger; its freedoms and autonomy are being destroyed by the Chinese Communist Party regime right in front of our eyes. The international community must act rapidly and robustly to support Hong Kong,\u201d Rogers urged.\n\nExclusive Video: Hong Kong Watch Founder Says UK Has a Responsibility to Take Lead, Call for Sanctions on China https://t.co/nSfXTkGfqE \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 24, 2019\n\nFollow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka"}}
