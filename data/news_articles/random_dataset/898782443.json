Last May, the council approved the change from PeopleService to MMS Environmental, as wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) management, but due to previous contract stipulations, didn\u2019t formally enter into an agreement with them until August. In October, the city opted two switch engineering from WSB & Associates to Widseth Smith Nolting.\n\nWhile MMS Environmental representative Mike Morris couldn\u2019t attend the January 8 council meeting, Public Works Director John Hanson and Craig Britton, of Widesth Smith Nolting, were present to discuss issues for the month.\n\nHanson noted the plant is looking into various options for replacement of six gas meters. \u201cThey\u2019re good for only a year after calibration and Mike said the price was unbelievably high,\u201d he added. As an alternative, the city is considering a portable unit.\n\nLikewise, a new sampler is proving to have its own hassles, namely electrical. \u201cThey have different plug-in than the old ones. Mike thinks he could make work, but doesn\u2019t feel comfortable cutting wires to make it fit,\u201d noted Hanson. The new sampler is four-prong, while the old is 12. Hanson also noted the city\u2019s insurance company had discussed the issue with Morris. \u201cHe said they\u2019re okay with getting the same [Isco] sampler that we have, but they\u2019re a lot more expensive.\u201d\n\nCity Clerk Rhonda Flattum noted financial assistance to cover the difference may be available through the League of Minnesota Cities. The difference is roughly $4,000.\n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the bleeding gonna quit?\u201d asked Councilor Dave Gudmundson. \u201cEvery month it\u2019s \u2018what\u2019s this\u2019 and \u2018what\u2019s this.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to get these; they\u2019re weather-related things,\u201d responded Hanson. \u201cThere\u2019s no information on how old or if they were already replaced.\u201d With staying with an Isco sampler, the city wouldn\u2019t need to replace wiring. \u201cIt\u2019s costly to replace wiring.\u201d The flow meter tied in with it, the UV, calibration\u2026 we don\u2019t know what\u2019s all tied in down there or where.\u201d\n\nFlattum will double check on the league paying the difference and on whether or not the $800 freight charge will need to be paid again.\n\nFuture plant items for the February meeting will be wholesale chemical orders through MMS Environmental, placement of an estimated $7,500 manhole, and status of the installation of the PointWatch System.\n\nIn other news, the city has amended its city maintenance policy for snow removal by public works. Initially, the policy noted removal of snow once three inches of accumulation is present. Several comments from residents prompted the council to review that level. \u201cIt\u2019s a common sense thing to me. If it\u2019s and inch and slippery; got to take care of it,\u201d said Mayor Jim Schott.\n\n\u201cNot everyone uses common sense,\u201d noted Hanson. \u201cA lot of people feel our city streets should look like the highways, but it\u2019s not gonna. We don\u2019t have the budget the state does.\u201d It was estimated that a two-inch snowfall equates to roughly eight hours of plowing, sanding, and additional removal items. In the end, it was unanimously determined that when to plow would be left to the discretion of Public Works. Sanding may be used in low-accumulation events.\n\nContinued Public Works items included discussion of whether or not to order additional double-sided pedestrian crosswalk signs. The city ordered one previously and set $700 in unassigned reserve funds for a second at some point. A new option will allow the city to get two more signs at that cost. Seeing the reduced cost options, the council approved ordering three, giving the city four total. They will be placed by the intersection of Main and First Street, County Road 8 and Main Street, County Road 8 by the Department of Natural Resources park and parking lot, and near the intersection of Cedar and First Street.\n\nA solar-powered speed sign will also be placed within the city. The city is sharing the cost of the sign with the county. The city portion is $1,000, plus any maintenance.\n\nHanson also requested the council consider the addition of an on-call, part-time maintenance employee to assist with snow plowing, lawn mowing, and other items, if needed. Hanson\u2019s time is largely taken up by WWTP items and other municipal needs. It was estimated that more than 20 hours a week at the plant alone. \u201cEven with PointWatch, someone is going to have to go out there daily,\u201d he added, noting checks on chemical feeds, making various adjustments and doing cleanings. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019d monitor without checking it. With PeopleService, they were out there every day and I was around helping out.\u201d While MMS Environmental could do additional checks at the plant, it would cost the city significantly.\n\nThe council opted to discuss the matter with Mike Morris prior to seeking an additional maintenance worker. \u201cChange some things to help John out. If you can find someone for an on-call, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with that. The rest of us are here, too. We can all pitch in,\u201d added Schott.\n\nThe council also unanimously decided to interview both applicants for the city clerk position, which will be open in May, following Flattum\u2019s retirement. Discussion included what qualities the city valued most including government, financial experience, and good customer service skills. The council was reluctant to set a salary for the 30-hour per week position prior to meeting with applicants, alluding to paying more for additional experience and skills.\n\nInterviews will be conducted Wednesday, January 15. The council will discuss the matter further, potentially selecting an applicant for the position, at the February meeting.\n\nThe next regularly scheduled meeting is Wednesday, February 5, at 7:30 p.m., at city hall. The public is encouraged to attend."}}
