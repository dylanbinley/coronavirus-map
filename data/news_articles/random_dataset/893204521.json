Thousands were decorated, around 12,000 lost their lives.\n\nSince the end of the Second World War and the Holocaust, Jews and the German military have shared a complicated relationship. In July 2011, the German government put male military conscription into abeyance. Previously, however, Jews were not made to enlist in the Bundeswehr if their parents or grandparents were persecuted by the Nazis. Additionally, no Jew was forced to serve against his will.\n\nToday, several barracks are named after Jewish officers and military doctors. The most prominent example is that of Julius Schoeps, a military doctor who served in the First World War. Schoeps was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942, where he died of an untreated disease.\n\nThe number of Jews serving in the German military is marginal today, with Dr Sonja Fischer, spokeswoman of the Bundeswehr, estimating the figure to be around 300. \u201cWe cannot be sure, however, because we do not document the religious affiliations of our soldiers,\u201d Dr Fischer told TPS.\n\nNonetheless, the cabinet\u2019s decision to reinstall military rabbis after 75 years has been welcomed by the Central Council of Jews in Germany. In a statement, Josef Schuster, President of the Central Council and Vice-President of the World Jewish Congress, said the move would \u201cenrich the Bundeswehr\u201d, with the rabbis \u201cproviding psychological support and acting and confidants to soldiers.\u201d Schuster welcomed the decision as \u201cunderlining the Bundeswehr\u2019s place in our democratic society.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to TPS, Dr Fischer explained that the step was not only aimed at assisting Jewish soldiers already serving by \u201cshowing them that there is someone to address any problems and accompany them on operations,\u201d but also as a clear message to Jews considering joining the armed forces: \u201cWe are an open-minded, attractive employer and respect diversity.\u201d\n\nWhile Kosher food can be received upon request, it remained unclear whether observant Jews would be able to keep Shabbat when serving. Dr Fischer admitted the issue was a \u201cfringe issue\u201d and something she would not be able to clarify. Speaking to Dr Fischer, it becomes clear, however, that she is not expecting this question to be posed to commanders at any point soon: \u201cEverybody who joins the Bundeswehr is aware of the basic conditions within which we work.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer tweeted that the decision was a clear commitment to showing Jewish life to be \u201cnatural\u201d in Germany and had sent \u201can important message to Jewish soldiers.\u201d\n\nThe Bundeswehr will now embark on choosing Germany\u2019s new military rabbis. \u201cThe selection of the Rabbis will be conducted in coordination with the Orthodox Rabbi-Conference of Germany and the General Rabbinical Conference of Germany,\u201d a spokeswoman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany told TPS.\n\n\u2018I Feel Welcome as a Jew\u2019\n\nFollowing the horrors of the Holocaust and the atrocities committed by Germany in the Second World War, wearing a German uniform was \u201csomething we wouldn\u2019t have dreamt of doing\u201d, a Jewish soldier serving in the Germany army told TPS on condition of anonymity. \u201cBut I have understood that this is not the Wehrmacht I am fighting in, this is the legitimate army of a democratic state. I feel welcome as a Jew.\u201d\n\nGermany is hoping that its military rabbis will ensure more Jews feel like this soldier. Only time will tell whether Germany\u2019s optimism over the mainstream reintegration of Jews in the army will bear fruit.\n\nPart of this normalization can be seen in joint exercises the Bundeswehr has recently undertaken with the IDF. The German army frequently sends its troops to Israel to learn valuable lessons on drone and urban warfare. In November the German Air Force participated in the international \u201cBlue Flag\u201d exercise in the Negev. In April, the IDF embarked on a 10-day drill in Germany. It was the first time the IDF had participated in an exercise on German soil.\n\nLast week the Chief of Defence of the German Armed Forces General Eberhard Zorn visited Israel as the guest of the IDF\u2019s Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi. Zorn also visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem and placed a wreath."}}
