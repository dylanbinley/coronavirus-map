Over the course of four days they filmed everything that was needed.\n\nJackson says: \u201cIn the finished movie, I hope that audiences just see Ian Holm reprising Bilbo. But what I experienced on set was a wonderful actor delivering his last performance. It was incredibly brave of him to do that, and very emotional for those who witnessed it.\u201d\n\nThe full letter can be found over at Deadline.com"}}
