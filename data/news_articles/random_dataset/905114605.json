Specifically, he wants to duplicate China\u2019s policy of executing drug dealers.\n\n\u201cCountries with a powerful death penalty, with a fair but quick trial, they have very little if any drug problem. That includes China,\u201d he noted.\n\nChina is known for many things, but fair trials is conspicuously not among them. As tweeter Brandon Rittiman pointed out, the State Department specifically warns American travelers that the Chinese legal system \u201ccan be opaque,\u201d \u201carbitrary,\u201d and is subject to \u201cpolitical influence.\u201d Trials in China are not \u201cfair,\u201d though they can be \u201cquick.\u201d Drug sentences in China do indeed include state executions, though, which is transparently the only part Donald Trump is most interested in.\n\nTwo other bits seem evident as well: Trump doesn\u2019t mean, for example, the Sackler family, who are ground zero for much of the U.S. opioid epidemic. Trump also is unlikely to mean he intends to start executing drug users in the regions that epidemic is most rampant: white, rural, Trump-supporting places. On the contrary, Trump\u2019s visions of ultimate \u201cjustice\u201d tend to run the most rampant when he is discussing, a la white supremacist Republican Rep. Steve King, the \u201cdrug mules\u201d of the southern border, so we can presume any such speedy-trial, speedy-execution plan would at least initially be aimed mostly toward Trump\u2019s new tented border courtrooms.\n\nBut Trump keeps coming back to this idea of executing more criminals, over and over, and it clearly is based in Trump\u2019s overall fixation on the raw efficiency of dictatorships. As a malignant narcissist, the idea of his own proclamations being enforced without archaic notions of checks and balances must be enthralling. The man may very well fall asleep each night imagining what he could do with such powers. As a vengeance-obsessed cretin turned tinpot authoritarian, the notion of dispensing permanent \u201cjustice\u201d aimed at whichever figures Trump deems most dangerous, with a Justice Department fully willing and able to carry out his orders, seems unlikely to be one Trump intends to confine only to one particular sort of miscreant.\n\nIn any case, when someone tells you who they are you should believe them. Trump has been consistent in his advocacy here, and unapologetic. He dreams of retooling the United States justice system to mirror what he finds best about autocracies: their efficient process of executing designated criminals. Some criminals, of course. Not others."}}
