American did not immediately respond to requests for more information about its amendment.\n\nThe carriers announced in early 2016 that they signed an agreement to establish a joint venture covering flights to Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay. Such arrangements involve establishing a joint business, with partners sharing revenue.\n\nSeveral regulatory bodies already approved the proposal, including those in Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Uruguay, and the carriers were aiming to close the deal by early 2019.\n\nChile's supreme court struck down the deal in May.\n\nAmerican's Mohan downplays any negative affects removing Chile may have on the joint venture's benefits. As originally envisioned the agreement would have applied to connecting flights out of Santiago, but the joint venture can still cover many of those destinations from LATAM's other hubs, Mohan says.\n\nSource: FlightGlobal.com"}}
