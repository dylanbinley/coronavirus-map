We need to address some of these issues, honorable members of parliament, to ascertain the truth about the information we receive and get the details and information correctly so that together, we can examine these matters. We know very well that President Edgar Chagwa Lungu has been at the forefront of fighting corruption where it emerges and he is the first one to order the banning of Mukula exports. The Chinese have various sources of Mukula, including the countries around us because the Ministry of Lands has got a schedule of trucks that pass through from the Congo, into Zambia to the ocean in Namibia loaded with Mukula trees. So it may not be Zambian Mukula that is reflected in the records of Chinese business houses and Chinese imports. So we should not sensationalize issues which are not very factual,\u201d Vice-President Wina said.\n\n\u201cMadam Speaker, I am surprised to see that a learned member of parliament can take issues from social media as the cardinal truth. That report, we wonder whether that report has been verified. Madam Speaker, the figures that are quoted in that publication are made up by someone who lives in the United States and not here. And the whole publication is based on falsehoods and propaganda. And I do not think members of parliament should depend on fake news to bring information to this House. We know very well, Madam Speaker, that the manufacturers of that report are well known and if they are so well known, we will investigate where this information is coming from. These are people who are being sponsored by international conglomerates and they want to tarnish the name and image of the President and also of Zambia.\u201d\n\nAnd Vice-President Wina said those claiming they could fix Zambia\u2019s economy within a week were not being truthful.\n\n\u201cMadam Speaker, if there are some individuals who think they are economic engineers and will fix this economy of this country in a week or in a month, I think they are not giving the country the true picture of the situation. Madam Speaker, I would say this government has performed well in tackling economic issues. There have been a lot of factors contributing to the decline in the economic sectors. We are aware of the drop in the price of copper on the London metal exchange, we are as well aware of the devastating effects of drought on our agricultural production. You are also aware of the escalating oil prices on the international market, we are also aware of other international happenings that impact on Zambia such as the war between the Chinese economy and the American economy,\u201d said Vice-President Wina.\n\n\u201cWe know what climate change has done to this country, resulting in power or load management of electricity. So all these factors have had a negative impact on the economic management of the country and I don\u2019t think any spin doctor could have changed the scenario but for this country to move forward, this government is committed to put in policies that will resuscitate the economies of this country as we move on.\u201d"}}
