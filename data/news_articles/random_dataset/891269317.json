He\u2019s scared someone is going to get into the flat. They are on the stairs, in the lift. He\u2019s asking me \u2018what\u2019s that, mummy?\u2019 at a condom on the floor. It is horrible.\u201d\n\nWhile the revamp of the railwaylands has worked to rebrand King\u2019s Cross as an upmarket place to live, a contrast from a historic reputation as red light district, people living in the surrounding roads say old problems still exist.\n\n\u201cKing\u2019s Cross has improved a bit. There are nice new buildings and all the rest of it around here \u2013 but it still has got the problems of drugs, homelessness, prostitution,\u201d said Ms Finnis.\n\n\u201cI have been here 22 years and it has never been as bad as this.\n\n\u201cI work with homeless charities and it is obviously very sad to see people on the streets, and when I see people taking drugs I get upset.\n\n\u201cBut I am also looking at it and I think am I really living like this? People are in the lift, having sex. They are sleeping on the balconies.\n\n\u201cThe building is falling apart, literally cracking.\n\n\u201cAll we really need is a metal security gate but they say they can\u2019t do it because its a listed building.\u201d\n\nThe tenants have come together to \u201cfight back\u201d against the problem have urged London & Quadrant, which runs two of the four blocks in Derby Lodge, to take firm action.\n\nA spokesman for London & Quadrant said: \u201cWe\u2019d like to sincerely apologise to all those who have been affected by the issues at Derby Lodge. The safety and wellbeing of our residents is our top priority and we were extremely concerned to receive the reports of this situation.\n\n\u201cUpon learning that the entrance to the electricity meter room of the building had been broken on the 4 November, we immediately sent a team down to secure the door. In the last week of November we received reports of rough sleeping, and discovered that the door had been damaged again. We arranged for a more robust temporary door to be installed on the 29 November and will do whatever we can to ensure the most secure arrangements possible are in place going forwards.\n\n\u201cWe have also learned that unauthorised people had been entering the block via the main communal entrance by walking in behind residents and visitors. We have submitted a planning application to Camden Council which will allow us to add a second security door to the communal entrance \u2013 in the meantime we are looking at boosting security at the building through adding extra locks. We have also arranged for the lift to be replaced in January.\n\n\u201cNo-one should feel unsafe in their community. We are in contact with the police\u2019s Safer Neighbourhoods team to explore options for setting up more regular patrols of the area, and would like to encourage residents who see anything suspicious to contact the authorities immediately. Residents also have the contact details of a named property manager should they have any additional concerns to raise.\u201d"}}
