She is very innocent and naive.\n\n\u201cShe was only in primary school last year living her best life, now she is being asked to search for hardcore pornography.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s 11, she should be doing stranger danger, and don\u2019t share your info online, but genital mutilation is another thing. It was asking about male circumcision, breast ironing\u2026I don\u2019t even know what that is myself.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time sexually explicit content has become part of young British students\u2019 curricula.\n\nNational File reported on a UK council responsible for a now-defunct online \u2018sextionary\u2019 accessible to students involving a list of extreme fetishes and paraphilias, including \u201cfelching\u201d and \u201cc**k and ball torture.\u201d\n\nVia National File:\n\nYet another bizarre story to emerge from the UK involving its hypersexualized curriculum. Earlier this week, National File reported on a teaching pamphlet from Warwickshire County Council which taught children as young as four about masturbation. 241 schools will trial Warwickshire County Council\u2019s pamphlet. Now, the same council has produced sex ed material directed at teenagers, teaching them about a specifically lewd sexual act: felching. Felching is a rather taboo act where an individual places their mouth on an orifice\u2013vagina or anus\u2013which has freshly received male ejaculation(s); the individual then proceeds to suck out the semen from that orifice.\n\nOther schools across the UK have come under fire for introducing taboo or adult materials to their students, angering parents.\n\nThe Everyday Essentials Sale is now live!
