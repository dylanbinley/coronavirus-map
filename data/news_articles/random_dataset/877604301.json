Restrictions were imposed by the police on movement within the area following the protests.\n\nMeanwhile, throwing his weight behind activists protesting against the chopping of trees, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray said, \u201cAarey is the most important issue for me right now. Whatever is happening today, whatever was happening yesterday, and whatever will happen in future\u2026 I\u2019ll collect detailed information of what the situation is and will speak firmly and directly on the issue.\u201d Firing a barb at ally BJP, Thackeray said, \u201cThe upcoming government will be ours, and once it comes into power, we will deal with the murderers of Aarey forest in the best possible way we can.\u201d The Devendra Fadnavis-led government has been maintaining that this is state land and not a forest.\n\nWhile the hacking of trees is ongoing in a 30-hectare green portion that was earlier reserved by the Fadnavis government for a \u201cMetro car shed and allied uses\u201d, Waikar said that \u201crelocating the proposed car shed to an adjoining partially slum encumbered plot wouldn\u2019t have required tree felling.\u201d\n\nRead | In poll season, parties out to milk Aarey issue\n\nThe car shed is being built for the 33-kilometre-long Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ underground Metro line, which is currently under construction.\n\n\u201cTrees are life. They should be conserved as much as possible. Also, the massacre of trees in the dead of the night is so not right,\u201d said Waikar, who claimed that \u201chis shakhapramukhs and workers were among those who were detained by the police.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI feel that the entire ordeal could have been avoided. The adjoining plot (partially slum encumbered) is big-sized. I had suggested that the car shed be constructed on this plot. The hutments could have been redeveloped or rehabilitated. That way, the car shed could have come up without destruction of the trees.\u201d\n\nIncidentally, Waikar pointed out that a small portion of the alternative plot is already part of the area reserved for the car shed. \u201cMy point was that the entire plot could have been reserved for the activity,\u201d he said. \u201cI had discussed this issue in the government but it wasn\u2019t considered,\u201d said Waikar.\n\nWhile CM Fadnavis remained unavailable for comment on Saturday despite attempts to reach out to him, he has quipped in the past that \u201cobjections had been invited and heard when the site was reserved for the car shed\u201d.\n\nQuestioning the credibility of the some of the protesters, Fadnavis had even said, \u201cAround 13,000 objections came\u2026 out of those, 10,000 objections were from one Bengaluru-based website. I can understand the view of (Aaditya)Thackeray on the tree-felling issue, but he should understand that what is going on in the minds of some handful of people who are opposing it.\u201d His comments had attracted criticism from environmentalists.\n\nDespite several attempts, Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited Managing Director Ashwini Bhide, and other senior officials of the corporation remained unavailable for comment.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
