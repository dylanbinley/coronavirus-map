The RCEP negotiations began in November 2012 in Cambodia.\n\nEarlier in the day, Goyal held a meeting with representatives of domestic industries, manufacturers and sector specific associations here to discuss regulatory instruments for the formulation and implementation of effective trade policy and development strategy.\n\nIn his address to the meeting, Goyal said that tariff and non-tariff measures will be used judiciously by India with an ultimate aim to enable the industry to become more competitive.\n\n\u201cThe objectives of the meeting were awareness generation about regulatory instruments amongst the stake-holders, to provide a platform where issues faced by the domestic industry may be appropriately addressed and calibrate trade policy to balance domestic industry interests, including protection against unfair trade practices with imperatives of consumer interest, efficiency and competitiveness,\u201d the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe meeting focused on the prudent use of all available \u2018Trade Policy Instruments\u2019 viz. \u2018Tariff Measures, Non-Tariff Measures\u2019 as well as \u2018Trade Remedial Measures\u2019 for the Indian industry,\u201d it added."}}
