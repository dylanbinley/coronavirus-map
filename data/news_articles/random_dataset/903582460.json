C. Wilson compared Adventist National School to biblical patriarch Jacob\u2019s dream about a ladder reaching from earth to heaven. Angels ascended and descended on a ladder in the dream, which Jacob had while sleeping about 60 miles (100 kilometers) from the school\u2019s site in Jordan\u2019s capital, Amman.\n\nThe dream, recorded in the Bible in Genesis 28, reassured Jacob that he had a direct connection to heaven, Wilson said.\n\nA view of the renovated and expanded Adventist National School in Amman, Jordan.

With the expansion, the school will be able to double enrollment and offer a number of after-school programs, including stop-smoking courses, healthy lifestyle seminars, and other initiatives aimed at improving health.\n\nSeventh-day Adventist Church president Ted N. C. Wilson (second from right), speaking with the assistance of an interpreter at a ceremony in the new multipurpose hall at Adventist National School in Amman, Jordan, on January 29, 2020.

Everything you do makes you and your future. This beautiful school will help contribute to the better health of the community through classes.\u201d\n\nMusic and English-language classes also will be offered by the school, located on Rainbow Street, a popular dining and shopping area near downtown Amman.\n\nBy expanding the curriculum, the school seeks to help children and adults in the community \u201cto enjoy a better quality of life and to achieve some of their life goals,\u201d said Rick McEdward, president of the Adventist Church\u2019s Middle East and North Africa Union, whose territory includes Jordan.\n\n\u201cWe hope that while we do this, we can represent the glory of God in this nation,\u201d McEdward said in an interview.\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church is recognized by royal decree as a religious organization in Jordan.\n\nFollowing Middle Eastern custom, the January 29, 2020, school ceremony opened with special greetings to a number of dignitaries. Darron Boyd, director of the Adventist Church\u2019s East Mediterranean Region, thanked each of those guests by name. When he finished, he thanked Jesus for the school and His plan of redemption.\n\n\u201cWe thank You that You thought of us so long ago, and we look forward to Your soon return to take us home to a better place,\u201d he said in a prayer.\n\nAfter the ribbon-cutting, one of the special guests, Mazen W. Shaban, chief architect of the school building project, presented Wilson with a traditional abaya gown and a handmade shmakh headscarf fastened around his head with a black egal headband. Wilson smiled as Shaban and another special guest, Hamdi Murad, draped the gown over his shoulders and wrapped the intricately woven red-and-white scarf around his head. It was a poignant expression of Jordanian hospitality.\n\nMcEdward, who is well acquainted with Middle Eastern culture after growing up in Saudi Arabia, said the gesture touched his heart.\n\n\u201cEach of those gifts was a way of saying, \u2018You are an honored leader among us in Jordan,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe school ceremony took place as Wilson and his wife, Nancy, kicked off a three-week trip through five countries, to encourage church members to be faithful. Wilson was scheduled to fly to West Africa next, where he will worship in Ghana on Saturday [Sabbath]. After that, he was planning to attend the General Conference\u2019s annual Global Leadership Summit, to be held this year in Cape Town, South Africa. His trip wraps up with visits to Malawi and Angola.\n\nIn Jordan, the school\u2019s renovation and expansion was carried out at a rapid clip under the watchful eye of Peter Koolik, an Australian construction manager who oversees world church building projects on behalf of the General Conference.\n\nThe renovation took place during the summer vacation months of June to August 2019, and the two new floors were added after that, said Shaban, founding partner and general manager of Sha\u2019ban Architects and Engineers. Useable space in the school complex, which includes an Adventist church and guestrooms, expanded to 23,142 square feet (2,150 square meters) from the previous 11,302 square feet (1,050 square meters), he wrote in an email.\n\nIn his speech, Wilson spoke enthusiastically about the school\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cAdventist National School is so vital,\u201d he said. \u201cBy God\u2019s grace, by the refurbishment and expansion works, the best days of this school are yet ahead.\u201d\n\nThe original version of this story was posted on the Adventist Mission site."}}
