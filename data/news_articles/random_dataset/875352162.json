But in a strange tale of propaganda gone wrong, he instead found himself stunned by \u201cconcentration camps\u201d where Muslims were banned from praying, forced to speak Mandarin and held for a year or more of Communist indoctrination.\n\nThe whole idea of this visit, from the Chinese authorities\u2019 viewpoint, was for us to sell a fake story to the world\n\nParty officials assumed he would report that nothing was amiss in Xinjiang, but now Olsi is describing what he considers to be a large-scale campaign to wipe out the Uyghurs\u2019 culture, language and religion.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea of this visit, from the Chinese authorities\u2019 viewpoint, was for us to sell a fake story to the world, to tell the world there are no concentration camps,\u201d Olsi said in an interview this week. \u201cBut what we saw shocked us \u2026 I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes.\u201d\n\nThe YouTube videos of the camps he uploaded were cited earlier this week at a U.S. State Department seminar, and Olsi was slated to discuss his findings at universities in Montreal and Hamilton Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe history PhD immigrated to Canada a decade ago, eventually becoming a Canadian citizen, but splits his time now between Toronto and Albania, where he teaches at a university.\n\nA contributor to the Yearbook of Muslims in Europe, his research interests include nationalism and religious reformation.\n\nIndependent human-rights organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have extensively documented mass-scale abuses against the Uyghurs. Most attention has focused on the detention of as many as two million in camps that Beijing says are designed to counteract extremism and teach vocational skills, but that critics call Orwellian re-education centres.\n\nEven so, Olsi was skeptical, and approached the Chinese embassy in Albania about doing research in Xinjiang.\n\n\u201cI wanted to see myself if some foreign governments and media are trying to manipulate with the issue of Xinjiang,\u201d he said. \u201cMy intention was to prove that this (allegation of widespread repression) is not true.\u201d\n\nThe journalists and others \u2014 mainly from central Asian and middle-Eastern countries \u2014 spent the first three days in Xinjiang\u2019s capital, Urumqi, listening to lectures, he said. The Uyghurs, they were told, were immigrants in a historically Han Chinese region, and Islam is a violent religion that directly threatens China.\n\nEven at that point, Olsi said he was prepared to view this as a standard sort of institutional Islamophobia, but not proof of organized repression.\n\nRelated\n\nThen the journalists visited the first of two \u201cvocational training\u201d centres that officials said were designed to de-radicalize extremists. Even from the outside it seemed like a \u201cprison in the middle of the desert,\u201d said Olsi.\n\nThe visit began with a Chinese-flavoured song and dance routine staged by Uyghur students, but Olsi insisted on touring the facility, the first stop being a small dorm room packed with 10 bunk beds and side-by-side Asian-style toilets.\n\nOn another stop, he asked a teacher if residents of the centre could pray. \u201cNo, not allowed,\u201d was the response, since Chinese law forbids prayer in \u201cschools.\u201d\n\nAsked what sort of offences landed Uyghurs in the camp, the teacher cited the example of people who had gotten married in religious ceremonies, breaking Chinese law that requires them to obtain a marriage certificate.\n\nAt another stop, he asked a succession of students why they had been forced into the camp. They spoke only Mandarin \u2014 not the Turkish-like Uyghur language \u2014 with their answers translated by officials.\n\nOne said he had downloaded a video that insisted Uyghurs who belong to the Communist Party are not true Muslims; a woman said she took part in \u201cillegal\u201d Koran classes at university and \u201cforced\u201d her mother to pray at home; another man said he watched an anti-Chinese video; and a fifth person that he downloaded material that said true Muslims must pray regularly.\n\nSome said they no longer prayed or considered themselves followers of Islam.\n\n\u201cAfter she came to this training centre, she learned Mandarin Chinese, she learned science and technology, she learned more knowledge and she felt she doesn\u2019t need that,\u201d the translator said of the woman who had taken illicit Koranic lessons.\n\nWhen Olsi addressed them with the traditional Muslim greeting Salaam Alaykum (Peace be with you), they repeatedly answered Nihao, Mandarin for hello.\n\n\u201cIf you speak your own language \u2026 and if you show the slightest sign of religiosity, you will end up in a concentration camp,\u201d he concluded.\n\nOlsi said he believes Beijing is deathly afraid of angering Muslim countries, many of which are key participants in its \u201cBelt and Road\u201d development initiative, and is organizing the media excursions to help manage opinion in those places.\n\nIn fact, he said most of the journalists and other observers on his tour, and seven trips like it before his, wrote nothing negative about China\u2019s treatment of Uyghurs.\n\nFabio Massimo Parenti, associated with Italy\u2019s anti-immigrant \u201cFive Star Movement,\u201d attended the tour after Olsi\u2019s and wrote a glowing report that cited the centres as a bona fide response to terrorism."}}
