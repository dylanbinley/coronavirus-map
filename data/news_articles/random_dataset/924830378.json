With their consent, their phone will push all the IDs their phone has registered as having come across in the past 14 days to the server.\n\nPerson B's phone will have been checking the server for positive beacons from their past 14 days, meaning they'll receive a notification from the healthcare app letting them know someone they've been in contact with has tested positive for the virus and linking them to further information about symptoms, how to self-isolate etc.\n\nIs it safe?\n\nGoogle and Apple's new system has been praised for the lengths it goes to to preserve user privacy.\n\nThe companies are using Bluetooth over location or GPS data to enable greater privacy, alongside concealing the identity of the contact.\n\nThe contact matches are also determined locally on the device, rather than sent to a central server.\n\nWhen a phone pushes information to servers run by the health organisations across the world, it appears as a series of randomised numbers, making it less likely governments can use the data to conduct surveillance.\n\nThe apps will ask the user's permission to participate in the tracing service, allowing the user to opt out of sharing their proximity info either temporarily or permanently.\n\nWhy isn't it being used in the UK?\n\nThe feature might not be used for contact tracing in the UK.\n\nThe NHS confirmed it would be using its own centralised system over the decentralised approach favoured by the tech companies, despite fears its methods will not be as secure or efficient.\n\nThe first contact tracing app was trialled recently on the Isle of Wight, but presented technological issues and sparked ethical debate.\n\nIt creates a centralised database of contacts at odds with the privacy Apple and Google have been at pains to emphasise.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock has insisted that all data collected by the app is stored securely and deleted as soon as it is no longer needed to trace the possible spread of coronavirus.\n\nBut a second smartphone app to trace the spread of Covid-19 is being produced, a new application that will instead incorporate the technology provided by Google and Apple."}}
