She also was ordered to pay $12,000 in restitution to the Mexican government.\n\nCastillo acknowledged that in 2018 and 2019, she conspired to smuggle or have others smuggle bags containing the sea animals from Mexico to a self-storage unit in San Ysidro, just over the border, according to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in San Diego.\n\nFrom there, the smuggled animals could be transported elsewhere for sale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe giant, worm-like sea cucumbers are eaten as a delicacy, especially in China. Authorities estimated the smuggled animals had a market value of $40,000 to $95,000.\n\n\u201cIllegal trafficking in fish and wildlife is big business,\u201d U.S. Attorney Robert Brewer said. \u201cWe are committed to working with our law enforcement partners to protect endangered wildlife.\u201d"}}
