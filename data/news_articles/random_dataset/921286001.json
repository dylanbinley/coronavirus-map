The allegations surfaced over a month ago but Biden hasn't been asked to respond until today. He also issued a lengthy statement on Medium before going on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" where he said the National Archives should release the document showing her complaint if it exists. However, the National Archives told Business Insider that it doesn't keep such records but the Senate does.\n\nOriginal:\n\nThe New York Times says the Biden campaign misrepresented its reporting on the presumptive 2020 Democrat presidential nominee\u2019s sexual assault accuser, Tara Reade, refuting claims that the newspaper reported that the allegation didn\u2019t happen.\n\nSource:The Christian Post"}}
