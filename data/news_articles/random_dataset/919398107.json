It encompasses Washington County, southern Nowata County and the extreme northern portions of Tulsa and northwest portions of Rogers counties. Cities included in Patzkowski\u2019s district include Bartlesville, Nowata and Dewey.On April 14, Patzkowski presented $1,000 checks to The Journey Home, Nowata Boys & Girls Club and The Ray of Hope.\u201cThe organizations that I\u2019ve shared with this week all do a lot of really good community work,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I am very proud to be a Cherokee and able to represent the Cherokee Nation and share that money with them. I want people to know that I\u2019m serious about what I\u2019m doing and that I really care about this community. I think it\u2019s good that a councilor has the opportunity to share with many organizations in their district.\u201dThe day prior while helping deliver food packages to elders, Patzkowski presented a $5,000 check to the Oglesby Volunteer Fire Department to help offset the cost of a tornado siren.\u201cThey had come to me a few months back,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were trying to get this tornado siren there in the Oglesby community, so I was very blessed to be able to help with that.\u201dWith the tribe\u2019s help, Patzkowski hopes to soon offer even more to the community.\u201cI\u2019m waiting on funds to distribute to law enforcement in Ramona, Bartlesville, Dewey and Nowata,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully those will be coming through soon.\u201dThe Journey Home is a nonprofit organization that provides hospice care in the Bartlesville community. Its mission statement is to \u201cprovide a \u2018home\u2019 for individuals with 30 days or less life expectancy who have limited financial and caregiver resources.\u201d The patient\u2019s hospice team provides physical, spiritual, emotional and medical support.The nonprofit Nowata Boys & Girls Club serves children ages 5-18 with after-school/summer programs and a special program that teaches children the Native American way of life.The Ray of Hope Advocacy Center in Bartlesville assists victims of child abuse.\u201cWe work from a victim-centered, strengths-based approach to empower survivors and their families on their journey towards safety and healing,\u201d the nonprofit organization\u2019s website states. \u201cOur mission is to facilitate a coordinated, community response and to provide hope and support to children and families impacted by abuse.\u201d"}}
