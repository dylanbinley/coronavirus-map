Lynch Jr.com", "TEXT": "Sen. John McCain is 2,200 miles from Washington and hasn\u2019t been on Capitol Hill in five months, but he showed this week that he remains a potent force in national politics and a polarizing figure within the Republican Party.\n\nFrom his home in Sedona, Ariz., where he is receiving treatment for an aggressive and typically fatal type of brain cancer, McCain has challenged and praised the Trump administration\u2019s actions on national security \u2014 his voice limited to news releases and Twitter.\n\nBut his declaration Wednesday in opposition to Gina Haspel, President Trump\u2019s nominee for CIA director, has uniquely roiled the political scene. The denunciation has prompted reactions from fellow senators and a former vice president, as well as intemperate remarks from some Republicans aligned with Trump, including a White House aide.\n\nIt has revived the fierce debate over torture and its effectiveness in extracting information in the years since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks \u2014 from a man who speaks from experience. McCain was held for 5\u00bd years in a North Vietnamese prison, often deprived of sleep, food and medical care, after a jet he piloted was shot down over Hanoi.\n\nAnd while McCain is not expected to cast a vote, his opposition to Haspel \u2014 based on her record overseeing controversial CIA interrogations of suspected terrorists \u2014 has injected uncertainty into her confirmation.\n\nAs Republicans and Democrats come to grips with a Senate without him, McCain has remained in Arizona, receiving visitors on the deck of his cabin.\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), one of McCain\u2019s closest friends, returned this week from an extended visit there and described his outlook: \u201cOne foot in front of the other.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the future,\u201d Graham added. \u201cWe talk about what\u2019s going on in the Mideast. I was pleasantly surprised [by his vigor], and I\u2019m looking forward to going back.\u201d\n\n[Lindsey Graham is encouraged after visiting John McCain: \u2018No talking about funerals\u2019]\n\nBut there is little expectation on Capitol Hill that McCain, 81, will ever return to his old haunt as elder statesman, jet-setting diplomat, military expert and conscience of the Republican Party. That is the subtext of his forthcoming book, \u201cThe Restless Wave,\u201d an elegiac volume set for release later this month in which McCain recounts and defends his efforts to expose and prevent torture, combat Russian expansionism and advance the postwar international order.\n\n\u201cBefore I leave I\u2019d like to see our politics begin to return to the purposes and practices that distinguish our history from the history of other nations,\u201d he writes. \u201cI would like to see us recover our sense that we are more alike than different. We are citizens of a republic made of shared ideals forged in a new world to replace the tribal enmities that tormented the old one. Even in times of political turmoil such as these, we share that awesome heritage and the responsibility to embrace it.\u201d\n\nMcCain also questions Trump more directly in the book, acknowledging \u201cglimmers of hope\u201d in his foreign policy but expressing grave doubts about Trump himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what to make of President Trump\u2019s convictions,\u201d he writes, adding, \u201cThe appearance of toughness or a reality show facsimile of toughness seems to matter more than any of our values.\u201d\n\nMcCain\u2019s illness has added gravity to his opposition to Haspel, who as a senior CIA official during the post-9/11 war on terrorism oversaw \u201cenhanced interrogations\u201d of terrorism suspects that some \u2014 including McCain \u2014 have described as torture.\n\nDuring a confirmation hearing Wednesday, Haspel pledged that she would never allow the CIA to engage in those types of interrogations under her watch. But she repeatedly declined to characterize the CIA\u2019s previous interrogation methods as immoral, saying they were authorized under the law.\n\nThe same day, former vice president Richard B. Cheney \u2014 the leading proponent of the interrogation techniques inside the George W. Bush administration \u2014 told the Fox Business Network that the CIA\u2019s actions did not amount to torture. He also argued, in contradiction of a Senate report on the issue, that \u201cit worked.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it was my call,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d do it again.\u201d\n\nHours later, McCain issued a statement declaring that \u201cthe methods we employ to keep our nation safe must be as right and just as the values we aspire to live up to and promote in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe Gina Haspel is a patriot who loves our country and has devoted her professional life to its service and defense,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, Ms. Haspel\u2019s role in overseeing the use of torture by Americans is disturbing. Her refusal to acknowledge torture\u2019s immorality is disqualifying.\u201d\n\n[McCain urges Senate to reject Trump\u2019s CIA nominee]\n\nThat denunciation infuriated some Republicans who have seen McCain as a motivated opponent of Trump and have moved away from the more idealistic strain of conservatism that McCain, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, has embodied.\n\nThe Washington Post and other media outlets reported Thursday that Kelly Sadler, a White House communications official, dismissed McCain\u2019s opposition in a staff meeting, saying, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter; he\u2019s dying, anyway.\u201d\n\nThe White House has not disputed the report. \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on an internal staff meeting,\u201d press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday.\n\nSeparately Thursday, retired Air Force Gen. Thomas McInerney said during an appearance on the Fox Business Network that torture \u201cworked on John\u201d during McCain\u2019s years in captivity. \u201cThat\u2019s why they call him \u2018Songbird John,\u2019 \u201d McInerney said.\n\nNeither Sadler nor McInerney has publicly apologized. Independent accounts of McCain\u2019s time in North Vietnamese captivity do not include any suggestion that he offered material information to his captors, and McCain says the same. He did, by multiple accounts, refuse offers of early release based on his status as the son of a Navy admiral.\n\nHis defense fell to his family and some of his old friends in Washington. His wife, Cindy, tweeted a rebuke at Sadler, and daughter Meghan addressed the attacks during Friday\u2019s broadcast of \u201cThe View,\u201d the ABC daytime talk show she co-hosts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand what kind of environment you\u2019re working in when that would be acceptable, and then you can come to work the next day and still have a job,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added: \u201cMy father\u2019s legacy is going to be talked about for hundreds and hundreds of years. These people? Nothingburgers. Nobody\u2019s going to remember you.\u201d\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden issued a sharp statement, accusing the Trump administration of hitting \u201crock bottom.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn McCain is a genuine hero \u2014 a man of valor whose sacrifices for his country are immeasurable,\u201d he said. \u201cAs he fights for his life, he deserves better \u2014 so much better.\u201d\n\nIt is possible, though unlikely, that McCain\u2019s opposition to Haspel\u2019s nomination could sink her prospects for confirmation. Most Democrats have opposed her appointment; Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) both cited McCain in announcing their opposition to Haspel on Friday.\n\nSeveral senators have yet to announce their intentions, and one key vote belongs to Arizona\u2019s junior senator, Republican Jeff Flake, who recently visited McCain in Sedona and said Thursday that McCain\u2019s words were weighing heavily on his decision.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always shared McCain\u2019s views on torture and looked up to him on this,\u201d he said.\n\nSean Sullivan, Seung Min Kim and Karoun Demirjian contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}}
