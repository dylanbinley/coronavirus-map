although procedures carried out on other parts of the body are allowed\n\nThe model, who was a degree in medicine from a university in Bolivia, where she lives and works as a doctor, represented France in the competition because both her parents are French.\n\nAnd British competitor Jessica Lopes, who was originally born in Brazil but now lives in the UK, took third place.\n\nThe highly anticipated event, was held at the Foro Totalplay venue in the central Mexican capital yesterday.\n\nThe Miss BumBum event was previously held in Brazil when it was a national competition, but it is now going global.\n\n(from l-r) Rayane, Suzy and Jessica beamed as they worked the stage having been deemed the 'best bums' in the world\n\nThe 29-year-old whipped the crowd into a frenzy after she was crowned 'Miss Bumbum 2019' in the first worldwide competition\n\nThe pageant featured representatives from the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, Spain, France, Germany, Portugal, Mexico and Brazil.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of contestants originally hail from Brazil or currently live in the South American country.\n\nThe competition was set up by entrepreneur Cacau Oliver, 40 from Brazil, who was inspired by a similar French competition.\n\nThe website explains: 'The idea of the contest was inspired by \"Show Me Your Sloggi\", which happens in France.'\n\nSuzy and the runners-up Raysa (left) and Jessica (right) show off their assets having been crowned\n\nThe 29-year-old will take home almost \u00a310,000 in endorsement deals having been deemed the best bum in the world\n\n'There were 8 successful editions in Brazil, 216 participants, many of them became national and international celebrities after their participation.'\n\nBut there is one vital rule the contestants must adhere to, and it is they must not have had any surgery on their bottoms -
