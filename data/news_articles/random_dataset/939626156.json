Goldsby, 25, of Longview, Washington, faces a first-degree murder charge for the June 2 killing of 70-year-old Robert W. Munger, who had lived in the neighboring city of Kelso.\n\nAccording to court records, Goldsby was captured on surveillance video attacking Munger from behind in a common area of the Airway Heights prison, knocking Munger to the ground and proceeding to punch, kick and stomp on his head.\n\nMunger received a skull fracture and died in a hospital three days after the attack. In December, a Cowlitz County judge sentenced Munger to at least 43 years in prison following convictions for child rape, child molestation and possession of child pornography.\n\nGoldsby \u2013 who was in prison for an August 2017 episode in which he stabbed a person, stole a Kelso police vehicle and injured a state trooper during a pursuit \u2013 was transferred late last month to the Spokane County Jail.\n\nIn an interview with detectives and another with KHQ News, Goldsby said he killed Munger because his younger sister, who is still a minor, was one of Munger\u2019s victims.\n\n\u201cHe raped my little sis,\u201d Goldsby told the TV station last month.\n\nAccording to court records, Goldsby was transferred from another state prison and arrived at Airway Heights at about 10:30 a.m. on June 2. Detectives responded to a report of his attack on Munger just over two hours later.\n\nGoldsby told KHQ he became enraged after figuring out who Munger was, and a correctional officer brushed off his request for a different cellmate. Goldsby said he later tried to contact officers by pressing a button in his cell but got no response.\n\n\u201cI had so much stuff going on in my head,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t stable at that point. I wasn\u2019t. I was getting to that point, because (Munger) kept wanting to give me details about what happened, what he did \u2013 about the photos and the videos of him doing this stuff. It was building up.\u201d\n\nSurveillance video shows Goldsby knocked Munger into a metal table and threw at least 14 punches before stomping and kicking his head several times, while other inmates looked on, according to court records. Afterward, a detective noted wounds on Goldsby\u2019s knuckles and a large gash on his right shin.\n\nIn an email Friday, Janelle Guthrie, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections, said prison officials review a range of information when determining housing assignments, including prisoners\u2019 criminal records, medical and mental health issues, gang affiliations, self-disclosed concerns, personality assessments and involvement in past acts of violence, as either victim or assailant.\n\nGuthrie said the DOC recently completed a review of Munger\u2019s killing, which found \u201cGoldsby\u2019s screening checklist and prison rape screening were completed before he was placed in the cell with Munger, and he made no mention of Munger during his initial intake.\u201d\n\nThe review also found \u201cMunger is not mentioned in Goldsby\u2019s case file and a review of this material prior to his arrival at AHCC would not have revealed his connection to Munger.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no clear indication in the documentation regularly reviewed for housing assignments that there was a potential conflict,\u201d Guthrie wrote.\n\nGuthrie said the DOC is cooperating with the Airway Heights Police Department and the Spokane County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. As an \u201cexceptional step,\u201d she said, the agency has asked the Washington State Patrol to review the incident.\n\nMunger had never been charged with a felony before one of his victims contacted investigators in June 2017. According to court records, Goldsby has an extensive criminal record that includes adult convictions for harassment, burglary and assault with a deadly weapon, as well as a juvenile conviction for custodial assault.\n\nGoldsby questioned how he ended up in a cell with Munger.\n\n\u201cThis stuff doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d he told KHQ. \u201cYou\u2019re talking the same institution, the same unit, the same pod, in the same cell as this dude. That\u2019s like hitting the jackpot in the casino seven times.\u201d\n\nAccording to court records, another inmate \u201ctold the corrections staff that in all his time in the prison he had never seen two inmates housed together who knew each other.\u201d\n\nGoldsby said he only meant to harm, not kill, Munger, and he would have preferred to see Munger \u201cspend his whole life locked up.\u201d Goldsby said he was forced into a situation that tested his self-control."}}
