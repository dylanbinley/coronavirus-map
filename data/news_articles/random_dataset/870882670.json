Two Labour rebels voted with the Government \u2013 Kate Hoey and John Mann. All 13 Scottish Conservative MPs backed Johnson.\n\nAngela Crawley, MP for Lanark and Hamilton East, said: \u201cBoris Johnson has no mandate, no majority, and has been installed by a tiny number of Conservative members, rather than the UK population.\n\n\u201cBy attempting to bypass Parliament, he is acting like a tinpot dictator and showing utter contempt for democracy \u2013 despite all the claims of Brexit \u2018taking back control\u2019, it\u2019s clear what Boris Johnson really wants is total control for himself.\n\n\u201cScotland voted overwhelmingly to Remain and we will never accept a damaging Brexit imposed upon us by a Tory Prime Minister without a mandate.\n\n\u201cI will do everything in my power to block a no-deal Brexit and stop this Tory Government in its tracks.\u201d\n\nRutherglen and Hamilton West MP Gerard Killen said: \u201cThis is an assault on democracy from an unelected Prime Minister who appears hellbent on lumbering the UK with a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cThe move to suspend parliament in a bid to slash the number of days we as MPs have to scrutinise the Tory government\u2019s position on Brexit is a constitutional outrage.\n\n\u201cDuring what is one of the most challenging periods of the UK\u2019s history, Boris has thrown his toys out the pram when he should be focusing on shaping a course for the future of our country.\n\nMr Killen added: \u201cI will support cross-party efforts to make sure the Prime Minister listens, and do all I can to prevent a no-deal Brexit.\u201d"}}
