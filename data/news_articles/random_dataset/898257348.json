Ahumada was arrested on a fourth-degree assault charge in late 2017.\n\nA judge ordered him released from custody pending his next court appearance, but police continued to detain him until U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers could pick him up and transfer him to an immigration lockup in Tacoma.\n\nCourts have repeatedly ruled that such detainer requests do not provide grounds to hold someone in custody, and a new Washington state law \u2014 the Keep Washington Working Act \u2014 bars local law enforcement from detaining people for civil immigration enforcement.\n\nAhumada remained in immigration detention for about two months, when he was released. Because he had missed a court hearing on his assault case while he was locked up, he reported back to Marysville police the next day \u2014 and he was arrested for missing the court hearing.\n\nOnce again, the municipal court ordered him released and ICE placed a detainer on him. The city kept him in custody for another day until he was transferred back to the immigration jail in Tacoma. At that point ICE realized Ahumada had already been released pending his deportation proceedings and released him again.\n\nThe city has revised its policy in response to the new state law and the lawsuit. It now specifies that \u201cNo individual will be detained or held solely on a detainer or civil immigration warrant \u2026 unless the document is accompanied by a court order signed by a federal judge.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis settlement agreement underscores what federal courts have already made abundantly clear: that local governments are not authorized, and may be held accountable, when they choose to hold someone to enforce civil immigration law,\u201d Matt Adams, the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project\u2019s legal director, said in a news release Friday.\n\nThe city did not admit liability in the settlement, which was signed Wednesday."}}
