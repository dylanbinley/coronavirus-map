But there are still flags to be flown. The organisation has instead created a community hub under the banner of #YouMeUsWe, full of useful resources to support LGBTQ+ groups and calling on allies to get thoroughly involved. It calls on each of us to reach out and understand one another, to be better allies, to call out all forms of racism, homophobia, transphobia, Islamophobia and any other kind of discrimination, and to actively engage with queer voices through books, film and media. The aim is to generate 30,000 acts of allyship \u2013 that\u2019s one for everyone who would have turned up to the 2020 parade \u2013 from donating to grassroots charities to writing to your MP demanding reform of the Gender Recognition Act and signing petitions.\n\nprideinlondon.org"}}
