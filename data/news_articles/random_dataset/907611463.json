Gen. Debold Sinas, chief of the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO), said he had directed Manila Police District chief Police Brig. Gen. Bernabe Mendoza Alba, to recall the Jan.31 memorandum.\n\n\u201cAlthough the memorandum is not about profiling but only the statistics of Muslim students as required by DPCR Salaam Police Center (SPC), we will make the representation to Directorate for Police Community Relations to reconsider their directive,\u201d Sinas said.\n\n\u201cThe NCRPO does not intend to cause harm and anxiety to our Muslim brothers and sisters. Please be assured that instead, I will direct the MPD Salaam Police to conduct a meeting with the Muslim student leaders in Manila City to accomplish the projects and activities for the Muslim community,\u201d he said.\n\nAdiong warned the PNP against \u201cperpetuating dangerous stereotypes that put the Muslim community at risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dangerous association made between violent extremism and Islam is not new, and is rooted in years of discrimination against Muslims in the Philippines,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis kind of profiling oppresses and ostracizes our Muslim youth, and creates a rift between the Muslim community and a police force that is duty-bound to also protect us as Filipinos,\u201d he added.\n\nPNP: It\u2019s for \u2018dialogues\u2019\n\nPolice Gen. Archie Gamboa, the PNP chief, played down the planned listing, saying it was meant to help the police set up dialogues with Muslim youth in threshing out peace and order problems.\n\n\u201c(With this initiative) we are, in effect, facilitating better understanding of the uniqueness and complexities of the different belief systems in a multifaith society by promoting healthy discussions and exchange of opinions thru the Salaam Police Centers,\u201d he said in a statement earlier on Friday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201c(The public must) not be swayed by disinformation spun by those with ulterior motives,\u201d he said, without elaborating.\n\nHe said both he and Sinas were from Mindanao.\u201cWe know better in getting along with our Muslim brothers than those who are good only at uneducated speculation,\u201d Gamboa said.\n\nSinas earlier said no personal information would be collected and no statistical data would be used by the SPC \u201cto conduct interventions and programs in strengthening Salaam Police in partnership with the community,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) said the PNP campaign \u201ctargets young Muslims who enjoy the intended safe spaces\u201d provided by schools.\n\nBangsamoro resolution\n\n\u201cIn the interest of upholding human rights, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) condemns the prejudicial treatment of Muslim youth by the Manila Police District of the Philippine National Police,\u201d said a BTA resolution authored by parliament members Amir Mawallil, Anna Tarhata Basman, Lanang Ali Jr, and Marjanie Macasalong.\n\nAdiong appealed to the Department of Education and the Commission on Higher Education to prohibit the release of private and personal data to the PNP.\n\nHe also asked the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos to take action against the PNP\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cProfiling entire communities solely on the basis of a single identity\u2014whether based on gender, race or religion\u2014supposedly in the name of curbing crime only fuels hate towards particular groups of people and intensifies fear of the police,\u201d Amnesty International Philippines said.\n\nPutting lives at risk\n\nAmirah Ali Lidasan, spokesperson for Suara Bangsamoro, said the memorandum \u201cputs at risk the lives of the Muslim youth. It does not merely associate the students with terrorism, it can also be used against them.\u201d\n\nA similar profiling of Moro men in Mindanao and Manila led to \u201cillegal arrests and detention of hundreds of innocent Moro civilians\u201d in the government\u2019s antiterror drive, she added.\n\nAt the House of Representatives, Deputy Speaker and Basilan Rep. Mujiv Hataman and Anak Mindanao Rep. Amihilda Sangcopan described the PNP memorandum as an \u201cact of discrimination in its highest form.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is utterly wrong. Profiling has no place in a nation that respects and draws strength from the diverse beliefs of its people. Guilt by association is wrong, and sometimes fatal,\u201d said Hataman, a former governor of the defunct Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.\n\n\u201cBaseless stereotyping can end in lethal results,\u201d he added.\n\nSangcopan said the police directive was one example of the evils she and Hataman had hoped to prevent in House Bill No. 1579, which seeks to prohibit racial, ethnic and religious discrimination.\n\nAlso done on \u2018lumad\u2019\n\nHataman said profiling Muslims was the kind of act \u201cthat makes extremists, not prevent them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our children growing up in an environment of fear and mistrust, and we don\u2019t want them to live in a culture of discrimination and hate,\u201d he said.\n\nBayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate said the PNP plan followed the \u201csame pattern used against progressives and the opposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll freedom-loving Filipinos must be very vigilant nowadays and stop these draconian moves of the Duterte administration before it is too late,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Eufemia Cullamat, also of Bayan Muna, noted that the military had done the same type of profiling of Lumad, or indigenous peoples.\n\nPolice Maj. Michael Garcia, the chief of the MPD District Community Affairs and Development Division who issued the memorandum, lamented that it had been \u201cmisinterpreted.\u201d\n\nHe said it was only intended for gathering statistics on Muslim youth in Metro Manila.\n\nIt will not include the names of students, only the total number of Muslims in a school along with their genders and grade levels, he added.\n\nGarcia said the memorandum came from the SPC and his office just sent it the various police stations.\n\nThe SPC was established on Oct. 14, 2008, by the National Police Commission through its Memorandum Circular No. 2004-008 upon the recommendation of then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\n\nIt is under the supervision of the Directorate for Police Community Relations and undertakes close monitoring, networking and liaisoning activities with Muslim communities in \u201caddressing terrorism and lawless violence in their respective areas.\u201d \u2014WITH REPORTS FROM KARLOS MANLUPIG, SHEILA MAE DELA CRUZ, JOEFFREY MAITEM, BONG SARMIENTO, RYAN ROSAURO, LEAH AGONOY, NIKKA G.
