Police.\n\n\n\nThere were 143 by this date last year.\n\nD.C. Police officers saturated many violent neighborhoods in the city late Monday night in an effort to cease the bloodshed. Now, the officers are getting another set of eyes.\n\nMayor Muriel Bowser and Police Chief Peter Newsham announced the expansion of the city\u2019s crime camera network.\n\n140 new cameras will be added to the network of 205.\n\n\"These cameras have been extremely beneficial in closing cases,\" Chief Newsham said at a Monday press conference.\n\nThe cameras will be added to areas with a history of crime, especially gun violence. The targeted areas include the U Street Corridor, Columbia Heights, Shaw, Saratoga, Greenway, Congress Heights, Southwest and Washington Highlands.\n\nThe city is investing $5 million for the expansion. The new cameras will produce high-resolution images, store more video, and automatically turn toward the sound of gunshots.\n\n\"Investments in technology are a critical part of our efforts to combat crime and build a safer, strong D.C.,\" Mayor Bowser said.\n\nThe city began its CCTV network in 2000, with cameras placed downtown to monitor large-scale events. They were placed in residential areas starting in 2006."}}
