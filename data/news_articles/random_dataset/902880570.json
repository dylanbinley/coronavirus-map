Critics, however, argue that the law will violate the presumption of innocence and will disproportionally restrict people's ownership rights.\n\nSeimas to uphold veto\n\nRam\u016bnas Karbauskis, the leader of the ruling Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, has said that the Seimas will back President Naus\u0117da's veto and will adopt the law with the proposed amendments.\n\nRam\u016bnas Karbauskis / J. Stacevi\u010dius/LRT\n\n\u201cWe have already talked to the president about the veto and we did what we agreed, there's a veto but with proposals that have been coordinated with the Seimas Legal Department.\u201d Karbauskis told reporters in Kaunas. \u201cI believe it's the way we need to go. The president has a different view but it matches our after coordination.\u201d\n\nAgn\u0117 \u0160irinskien\u0117, the chair of the parliamentary Committee on Legal Affairs, says the president's veto narrowed down the law but \u201cthe goal of the law is not distorted and its general efficiency will not suffer\u201d.\n\nLRT English newsletter: subscribe here\n\n\n\n"}}
