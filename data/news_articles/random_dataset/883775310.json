We need them.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: East woman plays Santa to Karoo farmers\u2019 wives\n\nSecurity company Fidelity ADT sponsored two of their bakkies and another ward councillor gave his 4X4 vehicle to transport the boxes.\n\n\u201cAll the bakkies were filled to the brim,\u201d Muller said\n\nOther ward councillors also joined in the initiative in different parts of the city.\n\n\u201cIt shows that as South Africans we can pull together.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the lack of rain still remains a problem in many parts of the country, causing dry conditions and low reservoir levels.\n\nAccording to water and sanitation minister Lindiwe Sisulu, enough rain to alleviate the situation was only expected in December.\n\n\u201cFarmers need all the support they can get,\u201d said Muller.\n\nDo you have more information about the story?
