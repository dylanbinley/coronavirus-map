The company\u2019s representative at the meeting declined to comment.\n\nEquinor later said it was important that the rainforest is protected and said it did not have activity in the rainforest but was limited to offshore oil exploration and a solar farm.\n\n\u201cWe ensure that our supply chain does not have a negative impact on the rainforest,\u201d a company spokesman said.\n\nHydro has a facility, Alunorte, located in the northern state of Para, that turns bauxite into alumina, the white powder used to produce aluminium at smelters, while Yara both produces fertilisers in Brazil and supplies Brazilian farmers with products.\n\nHydro and Yara were not available for comment.\n\nSeparately, KLP, a Norwegian pension fund with over $80 billion of assets under management, said it was contacting U.S. firms it was invested in that did significant business with agricultural producers from Brazil to ask for \u201cconcrete actions\u201d.\n\nKLP had contacted about the issue U.S. firms Bunge, Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland, in which KLP has invested 453 million crowns ($50.58 million) in stocks and bonds."}}
