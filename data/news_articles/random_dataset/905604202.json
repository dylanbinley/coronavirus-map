All are linked to the separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThey will go on trial from March 9 in the Netherlands at a high-security courthouse near Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport.\n\nHowever it is unlikely that any of the men will be present at the trial as neither Russia nor Ukraine allows its citizens to be extradited.\n\nThe Dutch government, however, \u201cin the context of preventing impunity\u201d has asked Moscow whether it would be willing to \u201cexplore in consultation the possibilities of transferring a judgment handed down to the Russian authorities,\u201d Grapperhaus said.\n\nThis would mean that the suspects \u2014 if convicted \u2014 would serve their sentences in Russia, the minister said.\n\nThe trial of the four men \u201cis an important step in finding the truth and justice for all 298 victims of flight MH17 and their relatives,\u201d Grapperhaus said. \u2014AFP"}}
