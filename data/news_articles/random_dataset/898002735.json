We'll show how you can use Kirby Corporation's (NYSE:KEX) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. Looking at earnings over the last twelve months, Kirby has a P/E ratio of 46.64. In other words, at today's prices, investors are paying $46.64 for every $1 in prior year profit.\n\nView our latest analysis for Kirby\n\nHow Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?\n\nThe formula for P/E is:\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio = Share Price \u00f7 Earnings per Share (EPS)\n\nOr for Kirby:\n\nP/E of 46.64 = $89.73 \u00f7 $1.92 (Based on the year to September 2019.)\n\nIs A High P/E Ratio Good?\n\nA higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each $1 the company has earned over the last year. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.\n\nDoes Kirby Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?\n\nOne good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (20.7) for companies in the shipping industry is lower than Kirby's P/E.\n\nNYSE:KEX Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020 More\n\nKirby's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.\n\nHow Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios\n\nCompanies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the 'E' in the equation. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.\n\nKirby shrunk earnings per share by 66% over the last year. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 17% per year over the last five years. This growth rate might warrant a below average P/E ratio.\n\nA Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The Bank\n\nThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.\n\nSuch expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.\n\nSo What Does Kirby's Balance Sheet Tell Us?\n\nNet debt is 26% of Kirby's market cap. You'd want to be aware of this fact, but it doesn't bother us.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Kirby's P/E Ratio\n\nKirby has a P/E of 46.6. That's higher than the average in its market, which is 18.7. With some debt but no EPS growth last year, the market has high expectations of future profits.\n\nInvestors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. If the reality for a company is better than it expects, you can make money by buying and holding for the long term. So this free report on the analyst consensus forecasts could help you make a master move on this stock.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates. So take a peek at this free list of companies with modest (or no) debt, trading on a P/E below 20.\n\nStory continues"}}
