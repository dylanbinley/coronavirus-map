For more than 40 years, it has served Chinese expats and U.S. travelers in eight southern states and Puerto Rico and has also played a major role in fostering international trade between China and Texas. Now anyone needing those services will need to seek help from one of the remaining Chinese consulates in Washington D.C., New York, Chicago or Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cThe consulate has been important to building bilateral trade and investment between the Houston region and China and for furthering cultural ties,\u201d Greater Houston Partnership CEO Bob Harvey said in a statement.\n\nHarvey, whose organization worked with the consulate to coordinate trade missions to China by every previous Houston mayor since Lee Brown went on to say, \u201cWe are aware of U.S. officials\u2019 concerns directed at Chinese officials and Chinese nationals regarding the theft of intellectual property and cybertheft in the United States and hope that China will take immediate steps to address these concerns. We look forward to the reopening of the consulate in Houston once these concerns are addressed.\u201d\n\nWhether China was dealing in espionage remains to be seen, but there are growing concerns that the U.S. overreacted.\n\nIn an article, Jon R. Taylor, University of Texas at San Antonio political science professor, described the move in a China Daily article as a \u201cdramatic step that seriously ratchets up contention between the United States and China.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very discouraging development and further evidence of the growing tension between the two countries,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nHe also said the shutdown \u201cis self-defeating \u201cfor the US, and is \u201ca misguided election strategy which engenders greater animosity, a disruption in soft power relations, and unnecessary mistrust.\u201d\n\nA pro-Chinese quote isn\u2019t unexpected in a Chinese media outlet, but the same was found in a Houston Chronicle piece about the closure.\n\nA Chinese politics professor at the University of California told the Chronicle that burning bridges is not the usual reaction to this type of dispute.\n\n\u201cThe typical response to things like embassy staff involved in espionage is the expulsion of the involved diplomats,\u201d said Victor Shih. \u201cClosing down the entire consulate is a fairly drastic course of action that will create a lot of inconvenience for anyone traveling to China.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was this opinion from Atman Trivedi, who worked at the State and Commerce departments during the Obama administration\n\n\u201cIf U.S. policy was once too accommodating of China, this administration has erred in assuming the inevitability of confrontation,\u201d Trivedi wrote. \u201cShort of war, shutting a consulate is a rare step that removes a diplomatic channel. In the midst of a historic pandemic, major powers should be talking more. Right now, Washington and Beijing are talking past each other, to rally political support at home.\u201d\n\nChina is Houston\u2019s third largest trade partner \u2014 importing everything from computers and electronics to machinery from China. Houston and Texas export back to China petroleum, refined products and chemicals.\n\nThere are 44 Houston firms with locations in China.\n\nSky Li, a Chinese businessman who works at a Houston firm, sees difficulties for those businesses ahead.\n\n\u201cI understand the U.S. government wants to protect U.S. companies,\u201d Li said. \u201cIn the short term, it might protect the U.S., but long term, it cuts lots of good opportunities for U.S. companies.\u201d\n\nBut there are other economic concerns as well. Chinese travelers flock to Houston\u2019s Galleria mall, where they don\u2019t hold back on spending. Chinese students come to Texas for higher education.\n\nAnd there is worry that closure of the consulate will lead to increased racial tensions at a time when anti-Asian sentiments are already high due to the rhetoric out of the White House about the pandemic.\n\nAs for Harvey\u2019s hope that the closure will be short-lived, there has been nothing to indicate his hopes will come true. In fact, China retaliated by ordering a U.S. consulate in Chengdu closed, which happened last week."}}
