Google challenged the ruling at France's Council of State, which turned to the ECJ for guidance.\n\nGoogle won the backing of ECJ court adviser Maciej Szpunar earlier this year who said that the right to be forgotten should only be enforced in Europe and not globally. Judges follow such non-binding opinions in four out of five cases.\n\nThe issue is important because it affects conflicting fundamental rights, said Richard Cumbley, a partner at law firm Linklaters.\n\n\"The case highlights the continuing conflict between national laws and the Internet which does not respect national boundaries,\" Cumbley said.\n\n\"It seems unlikely that the court would give the right to be forgotten global effect,\" he said. \"This would create a serious clash with US concepts of freedom of speech and other states might also try and suppress search results on a global basis reducing Google's search engine to a list of the anodyne and inoffensive.\"\n\nA Google report showed that it removed 45 percent of the 3.3 million links from 845,501 requests received in the last five years since the ECJ enshrined the right to be forgotten in Europe in 2014.\n\nThe world's most popular internet search engine has previously warned of the dangers of over-reach by Europe. In a blog post two years ago, the company said there should be a balance between sensitive personal data and the public interest and that no one country should be able to impose its rules on citizens of another.\n\nThe second case arose when CNIL rejected requests from four people to order Google to remove links found in internet searches using their names.\n\nThese included a satirical photomontage of a female politician; an article referring to someone as a public relations officer of the Church of Scientology; the placing under investigation of a male politician; and the conviction of someone for sexual assaults against minors.\n\nCourt adviser Szpunar recommended that prohibitions on processing certain types of data should also apply to the operators of search engines.\n\nThe European Commission, Microsoft Corp, UK rights group Article 19, the Wikimedia Foundation Inc and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press backed Google at a court hearing last year.\n\nThe cases are C-507/17 Google and C-136/17 G.C. e.a.\n\n($1 = 0.9076 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Grant McCool)\n\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed."}}
