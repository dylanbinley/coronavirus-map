From CNN:\n\nCNN)The US is monitoring intelligence that suggests North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong Un, is in grave danger after undergoing a previous surgery, according to a US official with direct knowledge. A second source familiar with the intelligence told CNN that the US has been closely monitoring reports on Kim\u2019s health.\n\nKim recently missed the celebration of his grandfather\u2019s birthday on April 15, which raised speculation about his well-being. He had been seen four days before that at a government meeting.\n\nAnother US official told CNN Monday that the concerns about Kim\u2019s health are credible but the severity is hard to assess.\n\nUSA Today responds that South Korea isn\u2019t concerned:\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s government said Tuesday it had no information to corroborate a media report suggesting that Washington is monitoring intelligence indicating North Korea\u2019s leader was gravely ill after he reportedly underwent heart surgery earlier this month. Seoul has not detected any unusual activity or signs coming from Pyongyang about Kim Jong Un\u2019s health, according to Kang Min-seok, a spokesman for the Blue House, the office and residence of South Korea President Moon Jae-in. South Korea\u2019s statement comes after a CNN report, citing an unnamed U.S. official \u201cwith direct knowledge\u201d of the matter, said the U.S. is keeping an eye on intelligence suggesting that the North Korean leader\u2019s health was in \u201cgrave danger.\u201d A second official cited by CNN said the intelligence about Kim\u2019s health was credible. The official acknowledged it was hard to assess how seriously ill he may be.\n\nSidestepping for the moment wisecracks about the lack of novelty in countries\u2019 leaders being braindead, mystery about the goings-on in North Korea is hardly new or surprising. We just don\u2019t know a great a lot about what happens there.\n\nHowever, a sudden change in leadership in any nuclear-armed country is newsworthy and not particularly welcome under the circumstances."}}
