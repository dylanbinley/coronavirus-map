He was shot and critically injured in the neck, and was rushed to a nearby Salfit hospital, but was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.\n\nThe killing of Abu Yaacoub follows a number of shooting deaths by Israeli forces, including that of 32-year-old Iyad al-Halak, an autistic Palestinian man who also slain by Israeli police in Jerusalem.\n\nAhmad Erekat, another Palestinian civilian, was shot and killed by Israeli security forces on his way to pick up his mother and sister for a wedding later that day.\n\nPalestinians have drawn comparisons between Halak\u2018s death and that of African American George Floyd, after a police officer in Minneapolis pressed a knee into Floyd\u2018s neck while detaining him on 25 May, just a few days before Halak\u2018s death at the hands of Israeli police.\n\nPalestinians have long accused the country of carrying out superficial investigations into crimes committed by Israeli forces or settlers against Palestinians. Israelis are rarely prosecuted for killing Palestinians, and if found guilty, typically receive lenient sentences.\n\nK.F."}}
