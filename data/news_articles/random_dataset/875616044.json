He has performed around 740 living-donor transplants prior to coming to VCU.\n\nHe said VCU's program quieted down by 2014 because the doctors behind it had left or retired.\n\n\u201cThe program wanted to restart doing this because there are patients on the waiting list because they\u2019re not getting livers on time or they\u2019re getting too sick to transplant and they\u2019re being removed from the list,\u201d added Dr. Kumaran.\n\nDr. Kumaran said that at any given time, there are between 13,000-15,000 people waiting for a liver transplant in the United States, but in a given year there are only 6,000-7,000 transplants done from deceased donors.\n\nHe added that between 1,000-1,500 patients will die on the waiting list.\n\n\u201cAnd a similar number will be removed will be removed from the waiting list because they become too sick to transplant,\u201d said Dr. Kumaran. \u201cAnd, of course, those patients will also die.\u201d\n\nHe said some patients are also never offered a transplant because they are too old or do not fit the criteria for the wait list.\n\n\u201cSo, if we can do living donor transplants we can potentially offer it to these patients that we\u2019re losing,\u201d said Dr. Kumaran. He said \u201cThere are many advantages to doing living-donor transplant, but the main thing is it\u2019s going to save lives.\u201d\n\nDr. Kumaran said living donor transplants with the liver are possible because the organ can regenerate.\n\n\u201cIt grows back,\u201d explained Dr. Kumaran. \u201cWithin a few weeks the remaining liver will grow back to a full-size liver. So, this lets us do this operation where we can take out either the right side or the left side or even a smaller part of the liver and use it replace the liver of someone who needs a transplant.\u201d\n\nDr. Kumaran said Foster\u2019s situation is one of those which was a good fit for the living-donor option.\n\nThe elder Foster suffered from primary sclerosing cholangitis, a disease that leads to inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts, which itself can lead to jaundice, episodes of infection, internal bleeding, and an increase risk of cancer in the liver and bile ducts, according to Dr. Kumaran.\n\nHe added that there is no effective treatment for the disease, so Foster would eventually need a new liver. But he said Foster would not get sick enough to move up on the transplant list and he was also close to being aged out, since he was 69.\n\nFoster said he broke the news to his family at a dinner in February in 2018. He said his family, including eight children and 21 grandchildren, were more than willing to step up to see if they were compatible as a living donor. Foster said even some in-laws and friends offered themselves up.\n\nIn the end, it was his youngest son, Rick Foster, that was a suitable match.\n\n\u201cHow soon can we get started,\u201d said Rick Foster, recalling his response to the news. \u201cWhen can we do it? Who do I call? Who do I talk to? What do I need to do? What tests?\u2026Whatever I got to do, let\u2019s jump on this.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe told me, he said, \u2018Well, you gave me life,\u2019 he said, \u2018It was time I returned the favor,\u2019\u201d said Ed Foster of his son\u2019s willingness to be a donor. \u201cWe must have done something right and it was just, I was proud.\u201d\n\nAfter months of tests, the pair were ready to go in for surgery in December, but Foster said there was a delay when the previous doctor in charge of the program left.\n\n\u201cSo, that made me wait eight more months and I could tell that I was steadily going downhill. I joked I said I had one foot in the grave, one foot on a banana peel,\u201d said Ed Foster. \u201cBut, God knew what I needed.\u201d\n\nCome July of this year and with Dr. Kumaran now in charge of the program, the Fosters underwent the successful surgery. Dr. Kumaran said the surgery on the operation on the donor, Rick Foster in this case, typically takes between four to six hours and the surgery on the recipient, Ed Foster in this case, can last between seven to ten hours.\n\nBoth men are now recovering, saying they only suffer from occasional soreness once in a while.\n\n\u201cI got my dad, so trade off is way more upside,\u201d said Rick Foster.\n\n\u201cI used to be tough as nails, this operation, I don\u2019t know, they took all the toughness out,\u201d joked Ed Foster about another side effect. \u201cI\u2019m so filled with joy. I tear up all the time.\u201d\n\nDr. Kumaran said since the Fosters\u2019 surgery, the program has completed another successful transplant and has three more in the works. He added they will be reaching out to the remainder of their patients who are on the liver-transplant wait list, about 60, to inform them they have restarted the program and to see if they can find suitable matches.\n\nHe said that right now, there are only about 350 living transplants done each year in the United States, but he said the trend in the next few years is that more centers are going to want to start offering living-donor transplants as an alternative.\n\n\u201cLiving donor is something we are, sort of, forced to do,\u201d said Dr. Kumaran. \u201cIf we had enough donors for everyone, then we wouldn\u2019t operate on a normal, healthy person. But, it\u2019s something we need to do because there are not enough organs.\u201d"}}
