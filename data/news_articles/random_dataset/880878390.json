Pick up your copy today in numerous locations across MTSU\u2019s campus.\n\nSix years ago, actor and artist Jack Millard tragically lost his wife of 17 \u00bd years to a car accident while she was in the middle of a losing battle with stage-four breast cancer. This is the kind of life event that can make or break a person, so Jack chose to utilize his grief and take the road\u2013less traveled. He did this by building boats.\n\nNot full sized, operational boats that can be taken out for the day at your average marina.\n\nSmall boats that can fit in the palm of your hand, with each one representing Millard\u2019s continued grief following the death of his life partner.\n\n\u201cIt was three years to the day after my wife was killed by a drunk driver,\u201d he said. \u201cI left a boat to represent every day for the last three years that she was gone, and I went up the California coast, leaving them for people to find.\u201d\n\nMillard\u2019s primary occupation is as an actor, and he\u2019s had bit parts in big movies such as \u201cThe Big Short\u201d and 2009\u2019s \u201cStar Trek.\u201d He thinks of himself as an artist in more ways than just performance though, as is evidenced by his current passion project. He calls them his \u201cLittle Boats of Hope,\u201d and places as many as he can in places where he feels the people who need them will find them.\n\n\u201cI found myself at a crossroads of what to do emotionally about dealing with grief and I realized my way out of grief was to create, and to create something that was of hope. I was feeling rather hopeless myself, and I\u2019m a believer of, in a biblical sense, \u2018As ye sow, so shall ye reap.\u2019 If you want hope you need to give hope.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s precisely what he did.\n\n\u201cIt was one of these random things where I found these particular [kurrajong] tree pods,\u201d said Millard. \u201cThese pods grow in clusters, and they grow in California and Arizona, they grow in very dry climates, and they looked like little fairy boats to me.\u201d\n\nUsing those pods as the base, Millard connects a feather to each boat to craft a sail. The physical process of putting the boats together in the first place isn\u2019t a short one, but he says that\u2019s part of what allows them to be so unique. For one thing, it takes hours to finish a single boat, which puts the 2,000 boats he sent out on the coast of California into perspective.\n\nBut what Jack believes makes these boats truly special are the messages of hope each one holds. The contents of each boat are simple yet poignant, such as \u201cDon\u2019t give up hope\u201d and \u201cYou are loved.\u201d\n\n\u201cMetaphorically or not, there are a lot of people out there who are just kind of lost. They\u2019re looking for a sign, they\u2019re looking for something to say, \u2018It\u2019s ok, it\u2019s going to be alright.\u2019 And that\u2019s where I got the idea of a message in a bottle, washed up on their own personal shores with a message that was for them.\u201d\n\nMillard has held installations of his little boats nationwide. Along with the California coast, he\u2019s left his art the Bethesda Fountain and Union Square in New York City, the Gorge Bridge in New Mexico and on one occasion, mud puddles. At the beginning of September, Millard\u2019s travels brought him to the Natchez Trace Bridge in Franklin, Tennessee, a bridge notorious for the number of people who have taken their lives on the opposite side of its railing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sadness about that bridge\u2026 I connected over 250 boats to the top of [it]. And what I\u2019m trying to do is reach one person, at least. Perhaps someone showed up to that bridge to jump, and maybe, just maybe, seeing this artwork, this little boat of hope that\u2019s been sent to them\u2026 from someone they don\u2019t even know\u2026 that it might be enough for them to change their mind, or might give them an opportunity to think about maybe another option\u2026If it\u2019s not enough to stop them from jumping off the bridge, one of the last messages they\u2019ll take with them is that they were loved.\u201d\n\nBoats of Hope/Natchez Trace from Genuine Human Productions on Vimeo.\n\nMillard makes it clear that the little boats aren\u2019t just for suicide victims, though\u2013 they are for anyone who is going through anything. He is fascinated with this battle between light and dark and defines his art as \u201cdefiantly optimistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo actually be joyful, to actually be optimistic, is to decide to make a difference or try to make a difference. And I want to be defiant, I want to be a rebel and not fit into the status quo, which tends to be a dark cynicism and apathy.\u201d\n\nMillard\u2019s art is certainly precious to him due to the personal place it stems from, but he sees something spectacular in the process of letting it become what its recipients need. It\u2019s a difficult but worthwhile process.\n\n\u201c[Each boat] represents the grief that I am still going through over the loss of my wife\u2026 but I\u2019ve also lost my mother and father at this point in my life, and I\u2019ve lost dear friends. I\u2019ve lost a friend to suicide, I\u2019ve lost several friends to cancer and tragedy\u2026 To make something so beautiful and to simply give it away or let it go\u2026 that has a resonance to me about grief and love and about giving of ourselves.\u201d\n\nMillard told a story from that day on the California coast, about the moment that affirmed his choice to continue this project in the first place.\n\n\u201cI saw a family enjoying themselves on the beach and they had one little child there. I stood up on the bluff to watch them\u2026 and I saw the silhouette of this little girl\u2026 and saw her discover one of my little boats. Her body language was of wonderment and she didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d\n\nThe father of the girl later found Millard\u2019s YouTube channel and left a comment that, in Jack\u2019s memory, said, \u201c \u2018My wife and I were fostering a young girl and we were having a hard time connecting to her, so we thought we\u2019d take her to the beach and maybe that would help her open up. She found one of your little boats and it gave us something to talk about, about magic in the world, and she was so excited and she wouldn\u2019t stop talking about where the boat came from and who made it and was this boat for her.\u2019 She kept it on her nightstand and\u2026 the relationship between those foster parents and the child had changed just from her finding this little boat.\u201d\n\nThis is the wonderful thing about art. Sure, we can make whatever we want out of whatever we want and present it to the world, but what the world creates outside of that is totally out of our control. It\u2019s also how Jack feels each boat manages stay personal even when he sends them away.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t made smart, I was made creative. Well, I\u2019m filling the void with my creativity. I\u2019m creating my way out of the darkness.\u201d"}}
