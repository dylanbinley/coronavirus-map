The presidents of the European Council, European Commission and European Parliament also traveled on Tuesday to the Greek-Turkish land border as a sign of support for Athens.\n\nOn Sunday, a child migrant drowned during a dangerous sea crossing to the Greek island of Lesbos.\n\nTurkey currently hosts 4.1 million refugees, including 3.7 million Syrians. There are also about 1 million civilians at the Syrian border with Turkey who left Idlib after the advance of the Russian-backed Syrian forces.\n\nA northern town of Turkey has offered free bus services for desperate migrants trying to make a journey to the Greek border, covering hundreds of kilometers.\n\n\u201cThe gates are open\u201d narrative and the free busses to Edirne have produced consternation and disbelief across the EU, and are seen as the first government-organized humanitarian crisis. \u201cIt makes further dialogue more difficult,\u201d Marc Pierini, a former EU ambassador to Turkey who is now at the Carnegie Europe think tank, told Arab News.\n\nAnkara has criticized Brussels for not keeping its promises under the refugee deal \u2014 to provide financial aid fairly quickly, lift visa requirements for Turkish citizens by the end of 2016, upgrade the Customs Union, and accelerate Turkey\u2019s stalled accession process to the EU in exchange for dealing with migrant management within Turkish borders.\n\nOnly 25,000 refugees have been resettled in European countries in the past three years, although Brussels committed to a large-scale resettlement. Of the \u20ac6 billion that was promised to Turkey, only 53 percent (\u20ac3.2 billion) has been disbursed.\n\nEuroMed Rights President Wadih Al-Asmar said: \u201cRefugees are not a bargaining chip to be played with at the whims of political leaders. Europeans cannot look away from what might become one of the worst humanitarian disasters the war in Syria has brought on its people. Respecting international humanitarian law as well as the human right to protection and refuge remain the sole possible answer in the face of such indiscriminate violence.\u201d\n\nAfter Turkish forces suffered heavy military losses in Syria\u2019s rebel-held stronghold Idlib, Ankara opted for an increasingly aggressive regional policy. Meanwhile, polls in Turkey reveal that almost 60 percent of the population holds anti-Syrian sentiments.\n\nThe mutual suspicion between Ankara and Brussels has encouraged Erdogan to weaponize the Syrian migrant situation.\n\nResearch fellow Luigi Scazzieri, from the Center of European Reform (CER), thinks Ankara\u2019s \u201copening of the gates\u201d has been seen in Europe as a move to blackmail the EU, with leaders saying that they will fully support Greece in controlling its border.\n\n\u201cEuropean leaders have a very negative image of Turkey at the moment and do not fully appreciate its role in hosting refugees over the past few years. But leaders also know they need to cooperate with Turkey if they want to avoid mass pushbacks at the border,\u201d he told Arab News.\n\nHow Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel\u2019s efforts to ease the humanitarian crisis will play out not only on Ankara\u2019s side but also on Europe\u2019s far-right populist parties is still unclear.\n\nGermany recently announced that it is ready to deal with the issue with Ankara, which is aggressively asking for more help from Europe after its regional partnership with Russia in Syria backfired.\n\n\u201cAfter we opened the doors, there were several calls saying \u2018Close the doors\u2019,\u201d Erdogan said on Monday.\n\n\u201cI told them it\u2019s done. It\u2019s over. The doors are now wide open. Since we have opened the gates, the number of refugees heading toward Europe has reached hundreds of thousands. This number will soon reach millions.\u201d\n\nAhead of the EU\u2019s extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council in Zagreb on March 5-6, EU\u2019s High Representative/Vice President Josep Borrell and Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarcic visited Ankara on Tuesday and Wednesday to hold consultations on migration management.\n\nThis time, Ankara can also ask Europe for more money for the possible reconstruction of a Turkish-controlled buffer zone in Northern Syria.\n\n\u201cA cross-border humanitarian operation for Syrian internally displaced people (IDPs) in Idlib province is entirely dependent on a cease-fire agreement between Turkey and Russia, and security guarantees agreed by Russia and Damascus and their enforcement,\u201d Pierini said.\n\n\u201cOnce this is agreed, the EU should contribute to an UN-led humanitarian operation,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, for expert Scazzieri, it will be difficult for the EU to assist with reconstruction or humanitarian assistance in Idlib until there is some sort of diplomatic agreement between Russia and Turkey to wind down the fighting in Syria.\n\n\u201cBut the EU can provide Turkey with more assistance in supporting the refugees it is currently hosting. I think it is quite likely that leaders will begin talks with Turkey over how to extend and potentially increase EU funding. But they will be careful to avoid the impression that they are simply giving in to Ankara\u2019s demands,\u201d he said."}}
