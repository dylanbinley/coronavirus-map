She said she expects to finalize contract negotiations soon.\n\nOnly the third woman to be named as the district\u2019s superintendent, Sayles-Adams was selected from among three finalists. The other two were school administrators from Mounds View and Belle Plaine.\n\nSayles-Adams, who grew up in St. Paul and is working on an Ed.D. from Minnesota State University Mankato, served as assistant superintendent of St. Paul Public Schools for five years. She was principal at three schools in Minnesota and three in Georgia.\n\nSchool Board Chairman Jeffrey Ross, in a statement on the district\u2019s website announcing Sayles-Adams\u2019 selection, said that after \u201ca challenging year\u201d the district wanted a leader who can \u201chelp bring together our community.\u201d\n\nThe controversies involving race are believed to have been a factor in the defeat of last fall\u2019s $121.7 million referendum in a district where 76% of the students and 94% of staffers are white.\n\nLisa Sayles-Adams, a longtime principal, wants to study data to improve schools.\n\nFeedback from community members has been \u201cvery positive,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThere is a genuine sense of excitement not just at the board level, but from staff, students, and the community about what we will do together.\u201d\n\nIn a two-hour interview with the board on May 14, Sayles-Adams emphasized the importance of studying data \u2014 grades, test scores, discipline records \u2014 to improve schools. She said she wants to maintain two-way communication with school staff members, community members and students.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t lead from your office,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be out in the buildings, in the community.\u201d\n\nRegarding the district\u2019s equity efforts, she stressed the need for public communication. Based on what she has seen in videos of public comments at board meetings, she said, \u201cIt looks like there may be a misunderstanding of what [equity] means and the purpose of the work. So right now it looks like there may be a sense of distrust.\u201d\n\nOpponents of the racial equity efforts say the school programs shame white students by pointing out examples of racism in the nation\u2019s history and culture.\n\n\u201cClearly, its goal is to indoctrinate our youth about our \u2018white and Christian privilege.\u2019 I reject this divisive ideology,\u201d wrote Mayor Tom Funk of Victoria in letters to two suburban newspapers in January. He invited further discussion of \u201cthe damage ... being done to our children and our community.\u201d\n\nVictoria is one of four cities in the school district, along with Chanhassen, Chaska and Carver. In a call last week, Funk, who is running for the state Senate, said he hadn\u2019t had a chance to review Sayles-Adams\u2019 background to comment on her hiring.\n\nSayles-Adams said equity programs must \u201ccreate a safe environment where we\u2019re not shaming people, we\u2019re not making them feel bad, we\u2019re not embarrassing them.\u201d\n\nData driven\n\nSupporters of the equity programs applauded the board\u2019s choice of Sayles-Adams while stressing that her race was not the main reason they like her.\n\n\u201cThe fact that she is black will be comforting to people that have experienced racial trauma in our school district,\u201d said Jenna Cruz, who belongs to the district\u2019s Equity Advisory Council and a parents\u2019 group organized to battle racism in schools.\n\nBut more importantly, Cruz said, in interviews Sayles-Adams \u201chad the most concrete answers [among the candidates]; she\u2019s very data driven. She just did her homework.\u201d\n\nDont\u00e1 Hughes, a longtime district activist who sits on the Advisory Council and is running for the school board, said he shared Cruz\u2019s enthusiasm.\n\nSayles-Adams \u201cwas way more prepared than the rest of the candidates,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cShe touched on a lot of points that I like: the importance of community, going to teachers and asking for their feedback.\u201d\n\nAside from Funk, people who have spoken out against the equity programs did not respond to e-mails and phone calls seeking comment.\n\nIncidents in the district drew widespread public attention last spring, when parents complained to the school board that their children have endured racist bullying by white classmates. Christopher, the former superintendent, apologized and the district organized the Equity Advisory Council, arranged an equity audit and hired an equity director.\n\nIn September, a group of black students and alumni filed a federal lawsuit accusing school administrators and teachers of hindering their education by ignoring racist bullying by white students, including physical assaults, racial slurs and death threats.\n\nThat same month, opponents of the equity programs posted a video calling equity \u201ca toxic agenda\u201d that benefits Muslims and students of color at other students\u2019 expense. They linked the equity program to the district referendum, as did members of a \u201cVote No\u201d group.\n\nDistrict officials said the levy increase would not be used to support the equity program. But two of the referendum\u2019s three parts, including the levy increase, failed at the polls.\n\nCorrection: A previous version said Sayles-Adams had completed her Ed.D."}}
