The jury will determine what amount of compensation should be awarded for damages.\n\nRobert Brisco, 46, of Chatham, and friends were returning from a hunting trip when Georgian Express Flight 126 crashed through the ice moments after takeoff. The others who died included brothers Ted Reeve, 53, and Tom Reeve, 49, of Chatham; Dr. Jim Allen, 51, of Mitchell\u2019s Bay; Ronald Spencler, 53, and Walter Sadowski, 48, of Windsor; and Fred Freitas, 38, and Larry Janik, 48, of Kingsville.\n\nPrice, a Richmond Hill resident, whose estate is also named in the civil suit, died in the crash along with his fianc\u00e9e Jamie Levine.\n\nThe jury heard previous testimony that Price told Donna Olsen, an Owen Sound Transportation Company employee, there were times he felt pressured by Georgian Express to fly in unsafe conditions.\n\nA statement previously read into the record from Price\u2019s mother, Alice, also noted her son telling his father during the previous Christmas that he felt pressure from the company to fly at times.\n\nEdmondson testified there was no pressure from the company for pilots to fly in unsafe conditions. He suggested there could be some \u201cself-induced pressure\u201d from pilot to complete a flight.\n\nHowever, Edmondson said the Windsor to Pelee Island loop was a \u201cself-dispatched\u201d flight where the pilot was responsible to ensure all requirements of the flight were met.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one that can force (pilots) to make a decision,\u201d he testified.\n\nThe trial continues Thursday with discussions on the charge to be given to the jury expected to occupy most of the day. It is expected the jury will receive instructions on Friday before being asked to make a decision on damages.\n\neshreve@postmedia.com\n\n@Chathamnews"}}
