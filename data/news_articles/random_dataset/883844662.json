It was the only way that they were able to recoup the tens of thousands of dollars owed to them. Under Canadian law, the Federal Court can order ships held by police to protect financial interests that are involved.\n\nA month earlier, the Resolute was held at anchor off Iqaluit. OOE owed Halifax-based Atship Services $100,000 for provisioning the ship, arranging pilotage services, berthing, fuel and other services. The money was paid within a few hours and the vessel continued on its course.\n\nKristy Schell disputes the idea that OOE\u2019s payment problems are recent. When she went to work for OOE eight years ago, co-workers warned her that the company rarely paid on time. It took eight months for her to get her money \u2014 right about the time she planned to sue.\n\nStill, Schell went back in 2018. Like most of the onboard staff, she went for the adventure. She wanted to see Antarctica and penguins, and because the trip is so expensive, working onboard was the only way she would get there.\n\nSchell is still owed $3,200 in wages and expenses for the contract work she did on the Resolute\u2019s inaugural voyage last October in Central America.\n\nOne of Schell\u2019s friends is owed $22,000. Another contractor I spoke to is owed $12,000 \u2014 unless she gets the money, she won\u2019t be able to return to school in January. The B.C. native didn\u2019t want her name used because the expedition travel business is a small, close-knit community and she doesn\u2019t want to be blacklisted for speaking out about a former employer.\n\nOthers have had to defer mortgage payments or give up their apartments because they can\u2019t pay the rent.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just contractors who are on the hook. So is the Royal Canadian Geographical Society.\n\nIts name is branded on One Ocean\u2019s remaining ship, the RCGS Resolute, and it has done co-branded trips with OOE. Its explorers and researchers have also been given free passage by the company.\n\nRCGS CEO John Geiger wouldn\u2019t say how much money is owed to the society. But he emphasized that it has no involvement in the expedition company\u2019s business operations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible situation and I feel very badly for those impacted personally,\u201d Geiger said. \u201cWe\u2019re very disturbed (that this has happened) and keep hoping they find a solution. The best eventuality for everyone would be to find an investor or buyer and restructure.\u201d\n\nVancouver-based Ocean Wise (formerly the Vancouver Aquarium) also has a stake in this. OOE staff and passengers collect water samples in both polar regions for its plastics research.\n\nThe Vancouver Maritime Museum has an Arctic trip planned with OOE next spring and, in the past, has received sponsorship money from the company for its Arctic programs.\n\nSince One Ocean posted a notice on its Facebook page Tuesday that it was seeking to restructure \u201cafter an extremely challenging period of time for our company,\u201d the company has gone silent.\n\nStaff in Squamish were laid off Friday and the office is locked. Voicemail boxes for senior staff are full. But even though a note on the company\u2019s Facebook page says the page is not being monitored, negative comments are being taken down.\n\nIt\u2019s an understatement to say that One Ocean is facing extreme challenges.\n\nThere were no injuries and the passengers and crew were all safely taken off when the Russian-flagged Akademik Ioffe went aground near Kugarruk, Nunavut on Aug. 24, 2018.\n\nBut the ship was damaged and hundreds of passengers booked on the Ioffe for the remainder of the Arctic cruise season were promised refunds or offered the chance to rebook for 2019.\n\nThere were investigations. Was it the fault of the Russian captain and crew or the OOE staff, who in consultation with the captain set the course into an uncharted bay where the ship snagged on a rock? More importantly, who would pay the costs?\n\nBy last fall, Ioffe was repaired and back in service along with its sister-ship, Akademik Vavilov, and the RCGS Resolute, the company\u2019s new ship that came into service in October.\n\nWhen the Antarctic season ended in May, the two Russian ships owned by the P.P Shirshov Institute of Oceanography and chartered to OOE by Cyprus-based Terragelida Ship Management were supposed to be go to Spain, where the OOE supplies and equipment were to be offloaded.\n\nInstead, they headed to their home port of Kaliningrad.\n\nWhy this happened is the subject of two arbitrations that will be heard in London.\n\nBoth OOE and Terragelida are claiming breach of contract \u2014 OOE for the loss of the ships and Terragelida for non-payment of debts including the cost of fuel.\n\nRegardless, it left OOE with only one ship and a fully booked Arctic cruise season for three ships.\n\nAustralian retirees Di and David Dempsey were among those who had their Arctic trip cancelled. They were promised a refund within 90 days. By Aug. 23, they had not received a penny. Then, OOE promised that they would receive it by the second week in September.\n\nOn Oct. 3, in response to their query, they got an email saying that 40 per cent of the clients had received refunds.\n\nIt was slim consolation to the Dempseys.\n\nThis week after reading about the restructuring, Di said in an email, \u201cI am sure we have no hope of ever seeing our money now.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: I have travelled twice as a guest of One Ocean Expeditions, once to the Arctic and once to Antarctica.
