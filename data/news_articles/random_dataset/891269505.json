The Skull People procession will carry signs asking residents to Vote for the Future of Your Planet, and to Think Climate When You Vote.\n\nIszi Jones of the group said: \"Climate breakdown is happening even more rapidly than scientists expected,\u201d said Malvern Extinction Rebellion.\n\n\u201cThe government we elect on December 12 will be the last one in UK history that has a chance to avoid climate catastrophe.\n\n\"There are clearly major differences between party policies on the climate and ecological emergency, and it is vital that people take this into account when casting their ballots.\n\n\"This is your last chance to vote for our children\u2019s future and to elect a government that will take bold leadership on the climate.\u201d\n\nThe Malvern Skull People visited the office of the Worcester News in September, delivering a letter to the editor highlighting the Worcestershire County Council\u2019s failure to respond to the climate emergency.\n\nThey also appeared in the Climate Funeral March held during the October Rebellion in London."}}
