It was symbolic and a way of honouring them,\u201d he explained.\n\nPlenty of noise, fun and pride. Each student was driven in a pickup truck to comply with social distancing. (submitted/Dianne Broom)\n\nOne of the grad moms, Lynn Boyer, helped organize the cavalcade in St. Louis which involved each student being driven in their own pickup truck. She, like so many other grad moms across the region and beyond, saw the need to try to make the day special, given the absence of formal ceremonies this year.\n\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t want their graduation to go by unnoticed, uncelebrated,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, we threw a little parade for them.\u201d\n\nHer daughter, Elizabeth Pala, said she and her fellow grads enjoyed it all, given the lack of other organized formalities.\n\n\u201cIt was really nice, especially because most of us [grads] didn\u2019t think we were going to get anything, period,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a great way to connect with the community while respecting the social distancing guidelines. We were in luck because everyone had a truck to use.\u201d\n\n(Courtesy of the St.Louis Fire Dept/Facebook)\n\nAnd Pala \u2013 who will study nursing at the new single U of S campus in Prince Albert from the fall \u2013 pondered whether the truck cavalcade and perhaps the fire department\u2019s involvement can become something of a new tradition.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely a great, new experience and I think it\u2019s something future grads will look to do to enhance their own Grad,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would be pretty cool to see that in the future.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nglenn.hicks@jpbg.ca\n\nOn Twitter:@princealbertnow"}}
