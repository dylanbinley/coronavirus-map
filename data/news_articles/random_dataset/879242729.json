We raise this issue now so that the international community can be ready to help if and when the time comes to shelter these innocents. We regret that this appears to be imminent.\u201d\n\nThe archbishop said Erbil over the past two years has already absorbed a growing number of Syrian Christian refugees \u201cwho have sought safety within the Christian community here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe expect that should additional Christians seek to flee conflict in Northeast Syria, most of them would come here to Erbil,\u201d he said. \u201cWe pray that the government of Iraq, the Kurdistan Regional Government, and the international community would not turn them away, but would help in providing for their care, along with all the other innocents of all faiths.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish incursion, aimed at uprooting Kurdish forces from the border that Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan insists represent a potential terrorist threat, only contributes to the already complex situation in the region, the archbishop said. The new conflict represents an entirely new threat to the progress and stability achieved at great effort and sacrifice within Iraq in driving out the ISIS caliphate and months of work to restore Christian and other Iraqi minority groups in Nineveh and Sinjar.\n\n[Want to discuss politics with other America readers?

Turkish President Recep Tayyib Erdogan has vowed to move 2 million Syrian refugees who are Sunni Muslim and currently in Turkey into the \u201csafe zone\u201d and displace Syriac Christians, Yazidis and Kurds, who are the native inhabitants of northeastern Syria.\n\nGreek-Melkite Archbishop Jean-Clement Jeanbart of Aleppo, Syria, said such a move by Mr. Erdogan risked causing a \u201cdemographic earthquake, displacing Kurds from their homes and lands and creating the conditions for serious internal tensions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be inhumane,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nWith reporting from Catholic News Service"}}
