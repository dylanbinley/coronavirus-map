The Deputy observed a group of individuals standing around a pickup truck parked at a convenience store in the area. As the Deputy approached the parking lot in a clearly marked patrol vehicle, the individuals dispersed in different directions. Further investigation revealed that the registered owner of the vehicle, Zaccereth Drake Silva \u2013 23 of Flint, Texas, had an outstanding warrant for parole violation from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
