Bright was removed from his role and assigned to a job at the National Institutes of Health last month.\n\n\"The past few years have been beyond challenging,\" Bright told reporters Tuesday. \"I was pressured to let politics and cronyism drive decisions, over opinions of the best scientists in government.\"\n\nAn HHS spokeswoman fired back at Bright in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\u201cDr. Bright was transferred to NIH to work on diagnostics testing,\" said spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley, describing the new position as \"critical\" to combating the virus. \"We are deeply disappointed that he has not shown up to work on behalf of the American people and lead on this critical endeavor.\u201d\n\nThe report argues that \"HHS political leadership retaliated against Dr. Bright for his objections and resistance to funding potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections and by the administration itself.\"\n\nBright's attorneys argue in the report that tension with HHS leadership dated to non-COVID-19 contracts earlier in the Trump administration. Bright said he resisted efforts to extend a contract with a company whose CEO, he was told, was a friend of Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and a senior adviser at the White House.\n\nBright also claims in the report that he met with White House officials as far back as February 8, 2020, to warn about the coronavirus and that he emphasized the need to \"secure N95 masks and to ramp up mask production,\u201d as well as other equipment.\n\nTrump said late last month that he didn't know about Bright or his accusations.\n\n\"I have never heard of him,\" the president said. \"I don't know who he is.\"\n\nBright is expected to testify before the House Energy Subcommittee on Health on May 14, his lawyers said."}}
