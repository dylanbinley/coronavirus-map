The royal couple not only displayed a keen interest in their unique traditions, but embraced it with true elegance.\n\nThe Duke and the Duchess of Cambridge garnered plentiful praises from Pakistani media for their humble gestures and warmth that they shared with others, according to Daily Mail. Pakistani newspapers and celebrities are reportedly impressed with the way the royals conducted their tour. A popular newspaper described Prince William as a \"real life Prince Charming.\" Meanwhile, Kate Middleton impressed her audience and won their hearts with her speech that included several Urdu words.\n\nOn Day 4 of their tour, the members of the British Royal Family attended a birthday party of three young children at SOS Children's village where Kate gave her first speech of the tour and left everyone surprised when she greeted them using Urdu greeting: \"Assalam O Alaikum.\"\n\n\"Iman, Ibrahim aur Daniyal apni salgirah pur bulanay ka bohat shukria,\" the 37-year-old royal said. As per English translation, it means: \"Hello. Peace be upon you. Iman, Ibrahim and Daniyal, thank you for inviting us to your birthday celebration.\"\n\nThe mother-of-three continued to speak in English and expressed her pleasure in getting to know the children and the village. For another engagement, the couple retraced the footsteps of their mother, Princess Diana and visited Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre. This is the same hospital that was visited by the late Princess of Wales in 1996.\n\nHere, the couple spent time with patients undergoing the treatment at the hospital and interacted with the families of the patients. They played with a tea set of seven-year-old Wafia Rehmani, suffering from kidney tumour. In a sweet moment, the real-life princess adorned a toy tiara as she hosted a tea party and played with the little girl.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met Wafia, aged seven, at the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital @SKMCH, as they spent time with patients undergoing treatment and spoke with their families. #RoyalVisitPakistan pic.twitter.com/AMp7cwnOhm Why advertise with us October 17, 2019\n\nEven Pakistani celebrities like Mahira Khan, Atif Aslam and Momina Mustehsan got the opportunity to spend time with the royals.
