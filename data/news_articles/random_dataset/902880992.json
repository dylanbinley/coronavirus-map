Jeffrey Greenberg/Education Images/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nWhen it comes to long-haul or even short flights, it's usually more expensive to buy snacks and drinks once you pass through security.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, many airports allow food and retail vendors inside airport terminals to charge 10% or more above \"street pricing,\" or pricing of items outside the airport.\n\nAccording to Insider's travel correspondent, Sophie-Claire Hoeller, the best way to save money on food and drink at the airport is to be prepared.\n\n\"The food at the airport is usually overpriced and not that good, so I don't want to spend money on it,\" she told Business Insider. \"I saw a woman eating cut-up vegetables in the airport one time, and did the same thing a few times afterward.\"\n\nA bottle of water is 200% more expensive in airports, the Los Angeles Times reported. This is especially annoying considering security bars you from bringing liquids through the gates.\n\n\"I usually bring my own empty water bottle so I can fill it up once I'm through security,\" Hoeller said. \"I also just purchased a collapsible water bottle which will save a lot of space in my carry-on.\""}}
