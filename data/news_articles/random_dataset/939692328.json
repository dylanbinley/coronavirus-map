He said: 'This role is vitally important in the fight to end the heinous crime of people smuggling across the Channel.'\n\nThe recent heatwave and calm seas have encouraged more boats than ever to cross the vast 84km expanse of water.\n\nA wheelchair user, a pregnant woman, unaccompanied children and a newborn baby were among the latest to arrive this week.\n\nUnder new plans Royal Navy and Border Force vessels would pick up migrants and take them to Dunkirk, northern France, rather than offering refuge in the UK.\n\nThe idea will be presented to the French government in Paris on Tuesday.\n\nThe youngster was carried from a boat containing at least six others.

Then with the shutdown and disruption to freight channels, there was much more reliance on boats.\n\n'We do not want a situation when there are adults in a setting with children and young people.\n\nImmigration still too high \u2013 poll More than half of Britons think immigration is still too high despite years of Tory promises to bring it down, a study said yesterday. It warned Boris Johnson that if his points-based immigration system allows a wave of mass immigration, then voters will turn against him. The study from the Migration Watch UK think-tank said most recent polling found that 54 per cent think immigration has been too high over the past decade. Only 5 per cent think it has been too low. And more than six in ten said they believe the Government has been mishandling immigration policies. The analysis found that fears over the effects of large-scale immigration became a major concern after Tony Blair opened the doors to millions from both inside and outside the European Union. Worries declined after David Cameron came to power in 2010 promising to cut immigration back to 1990s levels and subsided further after the 2016 Brexit referendum. The report said: 'Most continue to have strong views about a perceived lack of effective immigration control.'

France and other EU states are safe countries. Genuine refugees should claim asylum there, not risk their lives and break the law by coming to the UK.\n\nPictured: A swimmer crosses the English Channel as, in the background, a dinghy carrying migrants is escorted by French border police on Friday\n\n'I am working to make this route unviable. This involves: Stopping the boats leaving France in the first place and intercepting boats and returning those attempting to make a crossing.\n\n'This is complex to do and we face serious legislative, legal and operational barriers.'\n\nBut Labour former home secretary Jack Straw said any move modelled on Australia's controversial 'push-back' approach could have deadly consequences.\n\n'I don't think that just trying to push these people back is going to work and it will only take one of these dinghies to capsize and everybody to drown, which is perfectly feasible, for their to be a hullabaloo, including in the Conservative Party, and for the policy to have to be reversed, so I wouldn't go down that route,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nBorder Force chief Tony Smith said extra resources may not solve the problem as the Navy would 'be in the same boat as Border Force in terms of policy. The only powers we have are search and rescue and that is what we have been doing'.\n\nHe said that dangerous crossings of the Channel by boat will continue without an agreement with the French to return migrants.\n\nDover Tory MP Natalie Elphicke said it was 'absolutely essential' to stop the continued migrant crossings and said 'all options need to be on the table' to keep them from arriving from France, including the Navy\n\nHe said smugglers are exploiting a 'loophole' in the law of the sea which obliges vessels to rescue people once they enter the waters of their jurisdiction.\n\n'I think it can be overcome by bilateral agreements, we've done that before with the French.\n\n'Once you're on the waterways the law of the sea kicks in and we haven't, without a bilateral agreement on instant returns or joint patrols with the French, which would enable us to safely return them to France to be processed, we're going to see I'm afraid continual numbers of this.\n\n'And we need to find a way of breaking this circle and stopping the pull factor which is fuelling the smuggling supply chains.'\n\nAmong Friday's illegal arrivals there was a group of 12 men in their 20s, who were on a small vessel that was intercepted by Border Force officers\n\nFormer Royal Navy officer Rear Admiral Chris Parry said 'innovative solutions' like using unemployed passenger liners to re-route migrants are needed.\n\nHe said: 'We don't have to take them back to dry land. There's any number of unemployed passenger liners on the south coast at the moment, they could actually be taken there for processing for medical assessment and then onward routing either back to France or to the United Kingdom.\n\n'I think people need to understand that the old ways are just not cutting it at the moment and we need to apply innovative solutions.'\n\nBut Mr Smith said: 'Once they are under our jurisdiction we will immediately face asylum claims.\n\nThe number who have reached Britain so far this year is now already double the total who arrived in the whole of 2019\n\n'Without that agreement from the French to actually interdict people on the high seas and take them back to France the message is getting back to the migrants and to the smugglers that this is the way in and that does create a huge pull factor.\n\n'We could see something very similar to what we saw in the Mediterranean three or four years ago where the word will get out that all you need to do is get out on to the English Channel, you will be brought into the UK and it's very unlikely you'll be returned.'\n\nMP for Dover Natalie Elphicke said more needs to be done to stop the crossings.\n\nShe said: 'Putting an end to the small boats crossings crisis will only happen when migrants and traffickers alike know that they won't succeed in breaking Britain in this way.\n\n'For me that has three parts: firstly making sure that the boats don't leave France in the first place, if they do leave French shores that they're picked up early, and returned immediately to France and if people do break into our country and arrive on our shores that they are turned back to France.'\n\nA border force vessel brought the group into Dover today after 130 people made the perilous crossing on Friday\n\nAsked about speculation that Ms Patel was considering drafting in the Navy, Ms Elphicke said: 'There's some discussion about the Navy, and what I'd say is that as we've gone into this record number of people crossing over this year all options need to be on the table.\n\n'But whoever it is that's involved what we must make sure is that boats are deployed not to bring people into this country but to return them to France and for the French to do more to make sure that those boats don't leave in the first place.'\n\nMs Elphicke said the UK has an 'incredibly important' role in humanitarian and asylum issues around the world.\n\nShe added: 'What I don't agree with is that we should be encouraging or allowing illegal people trafficking that actually preys on some of the most vulnerable people and puts them at risk of their very lives.\n\n'What we've seen here in Kent, here in Dover and Deal, is we've seen an unacceptable situation of small boats actually arriving at the beaches, of people getting off those boats and roaming round the area and that's very, very worrying and concerning for local residents.'\n\nIt comes as migrants crossing the Channel were seen using makeshift flotation devices including lemonade bottles to make the dangerous journey.\n\nUK ministers plead with France to get tough on Channel migrants amid warning that 7,500 could cross by Christmas UK ministers have pleaded with France to get tough on migrants crossing the Channel to Britain after figures suggest that 7,500 migrants could cross by Christmas. Almost 4,000 migrants have crossed the Channel to the UK so far this year, according to analysis of Border Force figures. This is thought to be more than double the total for the whole of 2019 where fewer than 2,000 are believed to have arrived in the country. On current trends, around 7,500 migrants will cross the Channel by the end of the year, according to an analysis of official figures by Migrationwatch. This would be nearly four times the 1,892 that entered the UK via the crossing in the whole of 2019, the campaign group projected.

It is terrifying.'\n\nLucy Moreton, professional officer of the Immigration Service Union, said: 'Prices for crossing have fallen but for some people an average price of around \u00a34,000 per crossing per individual is too much.'\n\nMs Elphicke's fellow local Tory MP Damian Collins said the number of migrants crossing the Channel is 'shamefully high' and 'unacceptable' for his constituents.\n\nSpeaking on Channel 4 News, Mr Collins, who represents Folkestone and Hythe, said: 'It's good to have more observation at sea and more ships that can intervene if there's a problem, but having the Navy there doesn't mean we can suddenly intercept migrants in French territorial waters any more than we would let the French navy conduct operations within ours.'\n\nMr Collins said: 'It's clearly unacceptable for my constituents and for other people on the south-east coast to think that our borders are open, that anyone can get in a small boat, whoever they are, and make their way to the UK illegally.\n\n'Having the Navy in the Channel is great, but it won't solve the problem unless they can patrol French waters and at the moment there is no agreement that they can.'\n\nThe Home Secretary's spokesman said the 'fantastic weather' was behind the surge despite ongoing efforts to prevent them while Immigration Minister Chris Philp said he shares 'the anger and frustration of the public' at the 'appalling number' of crossings.\n\nMr Philp is to visit France next week to speak with counterparts following a 'constructive' meeting with the country's deputy ambassador earlier this week.\n\nThe fleet of dinghies included a girl aged around eight, another about 10, as well as at least five large groups of adults in the Kent town.\n\nThe children, some too young to walk, were picked up by the Border Force vessel Hunter and taken into a white tent at the marina at 12.15pm.\n\nSome of the adults - who appeared mainly to be men - carried their possessions in plastic bags before they were processed."}}
