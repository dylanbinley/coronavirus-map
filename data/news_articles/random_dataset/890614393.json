According to the report, construction workers said Hyde walked onto the construction site and yelled \u201cYou need to tell your f\u2014ng Mexicans to turn off their Spanish music.\u201d The report said there had been ongoing disputes between Hyde and the construction crew.\n\nHyde said details of the report, including the quote, were not accurate.\n\n\u201cWhat I said was, \u2018Turn the f\u2014ing music down, I\u2019m not some f\u2014ing Mexican,\u2019\u201d Hyde said.\n\nHyde asserted his comments weren\u2019t racist and were reflective of his displeasure with the style of music being played.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like f\u2014ing Mexican food,\u201d Hyde said. \u201cFor that matter, I don\u2019t like Japanese food. It doesn\u2019t mean I hate Japs.\u201d\n\nAdam Morales, a construction manager involved in the altercation with Hyde, stood by the account in the police report and said he believed race was a motivating factor in the confrontation. Morales said Hyde yelled at members of the construction crew on multiple occasions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just that he\u2019s full of himself or what\u2019s the deal,\u201d Morales said.\n\nHyde announced he would withdraw from the City Commission race on Saturday following the publication of a video of an altercation he was involved with at the Bath and Racquet Club. In the video, two Hispanic teenagers accused Hyde of making a racist comment toward them. Hyde initially denied making a racist comment, but in an interview on ABC 7, he admitted he did tell the teens to \u201ccut the grass\u201d and described his actions as \u201cracially insensitive.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Hyde rescinded his decision to withdraw from the race. Today, Hyde said he had considered remaining a candidate to push back against the tenor of criticism he received following the publication of the video and related reports.\n\n\u201cNone of these people know what happened,\u201d Hyde said. \u201cNone of these people care what happened.\u201d\n\nAs he did when he first announced his decision to withdraw from the race, Hyde acknowledged there were issues with his actions despite his belief they were not racist.\n\n\u201cDo I need to contemplate or consider my manner or behavior in a broader sense of how I deal with conflict or annoyance?\u201d Hyde said. \u201cYeah, absolutely, I do.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Hyde also said his departure from the public eye was not being done out of shame.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not abashed, whatever anybody else thinks I might be or should be,\u201d Hyde said.\n\nThis article has been updated to reflect comments Martin Hyde made in an interview on ABC 7 aired Tuesday evening."}}
