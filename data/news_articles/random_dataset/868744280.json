Felix McDermott. McDermott, a Vietnam War veteran, died April 9, 2018, at the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center.\n\nAn autopsy report included with the claim confirms McDermott\u2019s cause of death as a homicide. He was injected with a fatal dose of insulin into the abdomen, which wasn\u2019t ordered by a doctor, according to the claim.\n\nMcDermott, who had experienced a stroke, suffered from dementia and physical disability. He went to the hospital in April 2018 after developing aspiration pneumonia. McDermott was not diabetic and had no history of needing insulin, the claim reads.\n\n\u201cHe was showing clear improvement in his medical condition when he was negligently, wrongfully or intentionally injected with insulin,\u201d the claim reads. \u201cIf the medical examiner\u2019s conclusion is correct, Felix Kirk McDermott was murdered while he was in the care and custody of the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center.\u201d\n\nMcDermott\u2019s body was exhumed in October 2018 and sent to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for an autopsy under order of the VA Office of Inspector General, the claim states. The claim also alleges evidence exists that \u201cnine or ten\u201d other patients at the Clarksburg VA were also wrongfully injected with insulin into their abdomen, causing their deaths.\n\nAccording to the claim, McDermott\u2019s family was told by VA investigators that there was a person of interest in the deaths. The VA Office of Inspector General said Tuesday in a statement that it has been investigating allegations of potential wrongdoing at the hospital.\n\n\u201cAt this time, we cannot comment further on those activities,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cAs is always the case, the VA [Office of Inspector General] works with the department to identify and urgently address allegations related to patient safety.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., spoke to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie and Glenn Snider, director of the Clarksburg hospital. The person of interest in the deaths is \u201cno longer in any contact with veterans at the VA facility,\" Manchin said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThese crimes shock the conscience, and I\u2019m still appalled they were not only committed but that our veterans, who have sacrificed so much for our country, were the victims,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cI will do everything in my power to investigate these accusations and get to the bottom of what happened.\u201d\n\nWesley Walls, chief of public affairs at the Clarksburg facility, reiterated Tuesday that the allegations don't involve any current hospital employees.\n\n\"Immediately upon discovering these serious allegations, Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center leadership brought them to the attention of VA\u2019s inspector general while putting safeguards in place to ensure the safety of each and every one of our patients,\" Walls wrote in an email.\n\nMcDermott\u2019s family was told that he was one of the last known victims. The Clarksburg hospital \u201chad a duty\u201d to warn patients of the multiple suspicious deaths so that new patients, including McDermott, could make informed decisions about where to seek care, the claim states.\n\nHis family is seeking monetary damages of $1 million for personal injury and $5 million for wrongful death.\n\nRep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, urged the VA on Friday to work closely with the Justice Department and \u201cdevote all necessary resources to seeking justice for these veterans.\u201d\n\nwentling.nikki@stripes.com\n\nTwitter: @nikkiwentling"}}
