The Nigerian High Commission was reported to have prepared travel documents for the returnees but the South African Immigration stalled the process and wanted to know how the Nigerians came into the country and began to arrest them, an official of the commission disclosed.\n\nThe second batch would depart Johannesburg for Lagos tomorrow.\n\nAccording to NIDCOM boss, the returnees were 231 males and 86 females.\n\nShe said they would be profiled upon arrival and given stipends to move to their respective states.\n\nDabiri-Erewa said the Federal Government would also support those willing to acquire skills in collaboration with the Bank of Industry.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had on Monday ordered the immediate evacuation of Nigerians who had indicated interest to leave South Africa after receiving report from the Special Envoy deployed to the country.\n\nThe ministry had earlier stated that 640 Nigerians had registered and willing to return.\n\nFollowing the xenophobic attack on Nigerians in South Africa, Mr. Allen Onyeama, the Proprietor of Air Peace, volunteered to send an aircraft to evacuate Nigerians willing to return free of charge.\n\nThe process which was earlier scheduled to commence on September 6 ran into a hitch when it was discovered that most Nigerians willing to return did not have valid passports or travel documents to complete immigration formalities."}}
