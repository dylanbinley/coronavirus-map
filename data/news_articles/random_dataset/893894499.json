All 11 businesses in Chicago are white-owned.\n\nNo African-Americans applied for state licenses before the first lottery to distribute them in Chicago was held in November, and those that went unclaimed that day were for the Southeast and Far South districts set up by the city.\n\nThe districts aim to spread the wealth of the new industry across the entire city instead of having it concentrated on the more affluent North Side.\n\nSocial equity is supposed to be built into the laws governing how the legal pot industry will function, cashing in on promises from Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker to make up for how drug arrests have disproportionately affected minority communities.\n\nBut some alderman say state law, which includes a minority business development fund and the expungement of some weed-related convictions, does not do enough.\n\n\u201cIf we do nothing we get nothing,\u201d Alderman Jason Ervin (28th), chairman of the Black Caucus, said at the city council meeting Wednesday. \u201cDo we want to work to create community equity?\u201d\n\nErvin argued that licenses were given out to \u201cnobody looking like most of us in this room.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only people who benefit from this deal are white people,\u201d said Alderman Leslie Hairston (5th). \u201cWe\u2019re always told to wait our turn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a billion dollar industry about to take off without black and brown people,\u201d Alderman Sophia King (4th) said during the debate. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen something start off on the wrong foot and get on the right.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow it looks like a Monopoly game,\u201d King added. \u201cWe get a get-out-of-jail free card but we can\u2019t pass go or collect $200.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people who\u2019ve been the most impacted have been left out,\u201d Alderman Raymond Lopez (15th) agreed. \u201cIf this thing is about social equity \u2026 their licenses should have been first.\u201d\n\nAlderman Anthony Beale (9th) called the war on drugs \u201ca travesty in our community,\u201d adding that now that there was opportunity to be had, \u201cwe need a piece of it.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Alderman Walter Burnett Jr. (27th) said there were ways to make gains without delaying legalization.\n\nBurnett has told those who want to open a dispensary in his ward that they have to have a black partner, and said two of them have come back to him with one.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to understand when we got some wins,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an opportunity right now. Let\u2019s do our thing, man!\u201d\n\nSeveral other aldermen argued that delaying sales would not do anything to solve equity issues.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of room to work on equity provisions,\u201d said Alderman Brendan Reilly (42nd), adding that a delay would be a mistake. \u201cNobody believes that state law is sufficient.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a perfect bill, but it\u2019s a start,\u201d argued Alderman Gilbert Villegas (36th). \u201cThis is an industry that\u2019s just beginning. Move forward. Get this industry rolling, no pun intended.\u201d\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot, who said she was against the delay earlier in the week, eventually forced the end of the debate, sparring with Ervin over whether it should be over.\n\n\u201cYou all wanted to vote so we\u2019re taking a vote,\u201d she said.\n\nThe council decided that legal weed sales will still begin in two weeks.\n\nLicensing fees are $5,000 and operating a dispensary for two years will run $60,000. The fees are cut in half for \u201csocial equity\u201d applicants.\n\nIllinois has 55 medical dispensaries that can begin selling recreational marijuana immediately on Jan. 1. Up to 75 more licenses will be issued statewide through May."}}
