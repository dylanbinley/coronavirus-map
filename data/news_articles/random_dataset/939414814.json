The communications minister refused to budge to the opposition\u2019s protest and said he would not allow any other person to speak, if he was not given an opportunity to complete his speech.\n\nThe minister took both the opposition parties to task, claiming that the opposition was mostly concerned over inclusion of \u201ccorruption\u201d and \u201cmoney laundering\u201d in the list of the crimes mentioned in the passed bill.\n\nThe Senate chairman who had earlier stated that he would also give floor to leaders of the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA) after Mr Saeed\u2019s speech, however, abruptly prorogued the session when both the treasury and the opposition members refused to follow his directives regarding maintaining a decorum in the house.\n\nMr Bhutto-Zardari in his speech said the original draft of the government bill was against the fundamental rights of the citizens, claiming that the opposition had successfully prevented the government from imposing a \u201cblack law\u201d in the garb of FATF conditions. He said the opposition would support the legislations required to meet the conditions of FATF, but it would not allow the regime to do more than that.\n\nLashing out at the government, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said despite passage of FATF-related legislations, Pakistan would not come out of the grey list till the time the prime minister (Imran Khan) would continue to call Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden a \u201cmartyr\u201d and would not respond to the question about the escape of former spokesman for Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) Ehsanullah Ehsan. He also accused the government of selling off Kashmir. He also criticised the prime minister for not attending the joint sitting.\n\nMr Sharif in his speech only talked about the Kashmir issue and regretted that Islamic countries were not supporting the Kashmir cause which was \u201cdisappointing\u201d. He also criticised the government for not taking \u201cpractical steps\u201d to help the Kashmiris.\n\nAs soon as Interior Minister retired Brig Ijaz Shah moved the motion to take up the bill for consideration, members belonging to MMA, Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), National Party and independent members from the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas stood up and started raising slogans against the bill.\n\nPPP\u2019s Agha Rafiullah and PML-N\u2019s Mohsin Shahnawaz Ranjha on behalf of their respective parties withdrew their amendments, saying that they were withdrawing them as the government had accepted \u201cmore than 80 per cent\u201d of their proposals.\n\nThe amendments, which were later read out by Law Minister Farogh Naseem, could not be heard in the press gallery due to the noisy protest and on many occasions, Speaker Asad Qaiser did not allow the minister to read out the whole text, declaring that the amendments \u201cshould be taken as read\u201d.\n\nThe government had managed to get the bill passed from the National Assembly on Jan 6 after overcoming the customary resistance by the opposition parties, but did not bring it to the Senate fearing a defeat as the opposition is in a majority in the upper house of parliament.\n\nThe opposition had termed the bill against the fundamental rights of people, claiming that after its passage the government would be able to seek information from foreign countries and extradite its own citizens on the demand of other countries even without signing a treaty.\n\nIt had objected to \u201cunfettered powers\u201d given to the interior secretary as \u201cthe central authority\u201d to seek information about foreign bank accounts and transactions made by any citizen. It had also objected to a clause in the bill which allowed the government to hand over individuals to countries even without demand.\n\nAn amended clause of the bill says, \u201cThe central authority means the office of the secretary to the Ministry of Interior ....... the powers of such office shall be exercised by an executive committee\u201d, comprising the interior secretary, the secretary to the law and justice ministry, the foreign affairs secretary and the home secretaries of all the four provinces, with interior secretary as its convener.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 7th, 2020"}}
