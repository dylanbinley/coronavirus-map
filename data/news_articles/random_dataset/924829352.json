If possible, I recommend using a front porch as a visible reminder of the price that was paid for freedom.\n\nColor options for consideration could include:\n\n\u2022 A red candle to remember the blood shed in battle for the protection of our freedoms.\n\n\u2022 A white candle to keep our POWs/MIAs ever in our thoughts and prayers as we await their return home\n\n\u2022 A blue candle to salute the memories of those who made it home but are no longer with us.\n\n\"However you choose, whether it's one candle or three, I ask that photos of those candles be shared on social media, tagging The American Legion National Headquarters and using the hashtag #candlesofhonor so our message will reach families everywhere,\" Oxford said.\n\n\"An additional option is to show your gratitude by having each member of a family or group hold up a sign spelling out a message of Memorial Day.\n\n\"Also this year, remember our Virtual Memorial Day page on legion.org/legiontown. Please share with our national audiences the story of someone who served in the Armed Forces who holds special meaning to you. Share who you will be remembering this Memorial Day on social media using hashtag #VirtualMemorialDay.\n\n\"No matter how we remember this year, the most important message we need to send is that we will never forget.\"\n\nLocally\n\nIn-person suburban Memorial Day parades and ceremonies have been canceled, but many communities are holding virtual observances and a few are holding convoys that can be viewed from a distance.
