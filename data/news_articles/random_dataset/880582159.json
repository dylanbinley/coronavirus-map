To save every penny to send back to her family, Georgia often chose to stay in Kathryn\u2019s flat on her one day off a week.\n\nTheir story begins in 1996, when a human trafficker persuaded Georgia to leave her husband and three young children in the Philippines to become a domestic worker overseas. Her salary, he said, would lift her family out of poverty. She was trafficked into Singapore and locked in a room for four days with 10 other women before being assigned to an abusive employer. In two years, Georgia was only allowed outside three times.\n\nBut Xyza persisted and their employer, Kathryn Louey , chairman of Wai Hung Enterprises and the Wai Hung Charitable Foundation, offered Xyza an advance to buy an SLR. \u201cMrs Louey always wanted me to have something for myself, and she always wanted me to learn new things and be happy,\u201d says Xyza. \u201cAnd I think she thought I\u2019d really love photography.\u201d None of them knew it at the time, but this act of generosity would change all their lives forever.\n\nWhen Xyza Cruz Bacani told her mother, Georgia, that she wanted a camera, the idea was quickly shut down. \u201cI told her cameras are for rich people,\u201d says Georgia. Her mother wasn\u2019t being miserly or unkind. She was simply being honest. At the time, both women were working in Hong Kong as domestic helpers and saving every penny to send back to their family in the Philippines so Xyza\u2019s siblings could go to college.\n\nShe was a cleaner and nanny in Hong Kong when her employer encouraged Xyza Cruz Bacani to pursue her passion for photography. Now the Philippine snapper is a global phenomenon\n\nMeanwhile, back in the Philippines, Xyza\u2019s life had been turned upside down by Georgia\u2019s absence. Every weekday, eight-year-old Xyza was responsible for her younger brother and sister while her father worked on a faraway construction site. Xyza cleaned. She cooked. She helped raise her siblings and tried to keep up with her own schoolwork. This was Xyza\u2019s life\u2014one familiar to many in the Philippines and elsewhere in Southeast Asia\u2014until she turned 19 and followed in her mother\u2019s footsteps to become a domestic worker abroad.

At first, the mother-daughter relationship was fraught. \u201cI definitely had trauma from when my mum left,\u201d says Xyza, who resented it when Georgia would offer her advice.\n\nXyza captures more migrant workers on their days off, getting ready for a beauty pageant (Photography: Xyza Cruz Bacani)\n\nA New Perspective Things slowly improved. Xyza saw how carefully Georgia saved money to send home; Georgia listened to Xyza\u2019s stories of growing up without a mother. Their relationship strengthened further once Xyza had her camera. \u201cHong Kong was my first muse,\u201d says Xyza. \u201cI started going down to Central and taking photos on the street, then I started going to Kowloon. My mum doesn\u2019t venture out so much because she\u2019s always saving money for the family, so I\u2019d bring Hong Kong to her. I\u2019d show her photos of Tsim Sha Tsui, Yau Ma Tei\u2014all these places she\u2019d never been in all her years living in Hong Kong. I\u2019d also show Mrs Louey. The two of them became my first critics.\u201d Encouraged by Georgia and Kathryn\u2019s responses, Xyza started posting her street photography on Facebook, where her shots caught the eye of professional photographers, including award-winning Philippine documentarian Rick Rocamora, who sent Xyza\u2019s work to the editors of the New York Times. In 2014, Xyza was profiled on the newspaper\u2019s photography-focused Lens blog while still working as a cleaner and nanny.\n\nMigrant workers attending church service (Photography: Xyza Cruz Bacani)\n\nThe Big Break \u201cAnd then it was a rollercoaster ride,\u201d recalls Xyza. A year after the New York Times article, Xyza was awarded a Human Rights Fellowship by the Magnum photographic agency, giving her the opportunity to move to New York and study at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts. \u201cMrs Louey actually had to read about the fellowship in the newspapers,\u201d recalls Xyza sheepishly. \u201cWhen I got the scholarship, I posted it on Facebook and the news was like wildfire\u2014it spread like crazy. Then the South China Morning Post did a story about it. I didn\u2019t tell Mrs Louey about it because I had doubts. I was thinking, \u2018If I go to New York, what\u2019s going to happen after that?\u2019 I didn\u2019t have a job guaranteed afterwards. I really wasn\u2019t thinking about becoming a full-time photographer or leaving my job.\n\nPhotography: Xyza Cruz Bacani\n\n\u201cMrs Louey was in the office when she read it and she immediately called my mum and said, \u2018Where\u2019s Xyza?\u2019 She came straight home and asked me why I hadn\u2019t told her. So I explained to her, \u2018Well, I\u2019m not really planning on going\u2014 I\u2019m having doubts.\u2019 She said, \u2018Are you crazy? Chee-sing ah! It\u2019s a big opportunity for you.\u2019 I said, \u2018What about my job?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re fired!\u2019 It was endearing; it was funny. She said, \u2018You\u2019re fired because you need to go\u2019\u2014and that\u2019s when I made the decision to go. She reassured me that no matter what happens, she\u2019d always be here, the Louey family will always be here\u2014that if anything happened in New York, I could come back and work for her.\u201d See also: Tatler's Guide To Siargao Island, The Philippines\n\nI was very proud to see Xyza being noticed by other people. I knew that when she came back, she could make a lot of difference to Hong Kong \u2014 Kathryn Louey\n\nAll three women were thrilled and nervous in equal measure once Xyza made her decision. \u201cMrs Louey and my mum kept saying, \u2018Make sure to eat your vegetables. You need to pack warm clothes,\u2019\u201d remembers Xyza, laughing. When the time finally came time to say goodbye, they all broke down in tears. \u201cI missed her very much when she left,\u201d says Georgia. \u201cI kept crying because I was used to seeing her every day. I also worried all the time because New York is so far away but I didn\u2019t tell her\u2014I didn\u2019t want her to worry about me; I wanted her to focus on studying.\u201d Kathryn was upset, too, but trusted this was a stepping stone to bigger things. \u201cI was very proud and excited to see that she was being noticed by other people apart from myself,\u201d says Kathryn. \u201cI knew that when she came back, she could make a lot of difference to Hong Kong.\u201d See also: Lux Noctis: A Look Inside Photographer Reuben Wu's Upcoming Book\n\nPhotography: Xyza Cruz Bacani\n\nA Story Told Through The Lens And what a difference Xyza has made. She\u2019s now a professional photographer who specialises in documenting the issues of migration, and labour and human rights. She\u2019s photographed migrant workers at a shelter in Singapore for women who\u2019ve fled abusive employers and chronicled the lives of domestic helpers who have been illegally trafficked into Hong Kong and New York. These moving photographs have been published around the world and exhibited at Christine Park Gallery in New York, which represents Xyza, and institutions such as the Hong Kong Arts Centre, the Bangkok Art and Culture Centre, and the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum in Missouri. Many of Xyza\u2019s projects came together last year when her first book, We Are Like Air, was published by WE Press. We Are Like Air features the stories of eight migrant workers, but at the heart of it is Georgia\u2019s story. \u201cMy mum always says that her story is not special\u2014that everyone has this kind of story\u2014but I\u2019ve kept saying, \u2018Your story is important. You are important. You\u2019re an inspiration to many.\u2019\u201d Despite her initial reluctance, Georgia is now proud of We Are Like Air. \u201cI feel good about my family story being told because it\u2019s the normal story of migrants\u2014and because my daughter told the story,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cLaurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs, came up to me and said, \u2018I love your book; I love your mother\u2019s story.\u2019 I was blown away\u201d \u2014 Xyza Cruz Bacani\n\nGeorgia is also pleased because it\u2019s brought global attention to these stories, which\u2014like migrant workers themselves\u2014are often ignored. Philippine tycoon Jaime Zobel de Ayala invited Xyza to Manila to give a talk about the book, and she has spoken at various festivals around the globe, including the Mountain Echoes Festival in Bhutan and the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado. \u201cAspen is a crazy place\u2014so many private jets,\u201d says Xyza. \u201cI was walking in Aspen after my talk and Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs, came up to me and said, \u2018I love your book; I love your mother\u2019s story.\u2019 My mind was blown. I texted my mum, \u2018Hey Ma, I met the wife of Steve Jobs and she loves your story.\u2019 You know what my mother said? \u2018You should\u2019ve asked her to buy more books.\u2019\u201d\n\nPhotography: Xyza Cruz Bacani"}}
