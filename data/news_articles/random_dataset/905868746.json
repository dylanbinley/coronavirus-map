Having spent her childhood in Mexico, the United States and her family\u2019s native Kenya, the actress had seen her share of exotic destinations before finding stardom with films like Twelve Years a Slave, Black Panther, the recent Star Wars sequels, and last year\u2019s Us. But while her opportunities to travel have expanded vastly, Africa remains one of her favorite continents to explore.\n\nIn the last year, various film and TV projects have taken Nyong\u2019o to West Africa, a region that was previously unknown to her. During one of these trips, she visited Nigeria for the first time to prepare for Americanah, a new series she will produce and star in for the upcoming HBO Max streaming service, which will start filming in March. We recently caught up with Nyong\u2019o at the official relaunch of Delta SkyMiles American Express cards, for whom she\u2019s a brand ambassador (\u201cI spent three weeks in Ghana and I got there on my miles,\u201d she says) to chat about some of her favorite African destinations (so far), her tips for immersing in a new locale, and why she\u2019s comfortable being uncomfortable.\n\nHad you traveled much through Africa before last year?\n\nLast year was my first time in West Africa. I had traveled some in East Africa, Southern Africa, and a bit in North Africa, but Central and West Africa were still kind of new places to me. Since last year I\u2019ve traveled to Nigeria, Benin and Ghana. So I\u2019m making the rounds.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most surprising difference between West Africa and East Africa?\n\nIn Accra, Ghana, I was actually kind of underwhelmed because it looked so much like Nairobi. But one of the things that shocked me is how different our languages are. When I\u2019m in East Africa, there are some similarities to the language; I can sort of maybe get one word or another. In West Africa, the language is completely different to my ear. I didn\u2019t expect differently, but it was still shocking to me how little I understood. I understood nothing.\n\nHad you felt that kind of shock when you moved to Mexico?\n\nYes, but I had spent time learning French when I was younger, so there was a little bit of similarity (with the) Latin-based language. For me, going to Mexico and being surrounded with a new language wasn\u2019t the shocking thing. I\u2019m used to being in environments where I don\u2019t understand the language\u2014but I\u2019m also used to having refuge. In Mexico, there was no refuge.\n\nDid those experiences make you a better traveler?\n\nDefinitely. Frequent travel like I\u2019ve had has made it easy for me to feel uncomfortable. I can withstand the discomfort of being in a new place and not knowing how things work. But I can also be curious and porous enough to absorb and learn\u2014to adapt to a new environment.\n\nWhat do you do to adjust to a new destination?\n\nIt\u2019s always daunting to go to a new place and try to figure it out. One of the things that I do is put on the local radio station\u2014whether I speak the language or not\u2014because just having that feature in your life makes it less daunting. You start to recognize cultural patterns and start to form a certain consciousness of the place you\u2019re in.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite places in Africa so far?\n\nI love Zanzibar. I would go back there for sure. Food is a big thing for me wherever I go, and I love Zanzibari food. I also like the Swahili culture. There\u2019s a seafood market at the end of the day in (one of the) local squares where all the fishermen bring in the day\u2019s catch and everybody eats together\u2014I love that.\n\nRwanda is also beautiful. It\u2019s verdant like you\u2019ve never seen. And the people are extremely pleasant. What I love about Rwanda is the strong sauna culture\u2014people don\u2019t meet in bars they meet at the sauna, and I love that. One of my most memorable body scrubs was at a sauna in Rwanda.\n\nAnd I love the cuisine in Ghana. They have this pepper sauce called shito that is unbelievably tasty. It\u2019s made with crushed shrimp and I don\u2019t know what other goodness. It\u2019s an accompaniment to a lot of their meals and it\u2019s divine.\n\nWhat kind of experiences do you look for when planning a trip?\n\nI definitely like to visit places where I know someone on the ground. The best visit is one that is personalized, and I like to visit that person\u2019s version of their country or their city as a starting point.\n\nWhat do you look for in a hotel?\n\nWhen it comes to hotels, I definitely love my luxury, so I want to have all the key global amenities. But I also like it when there is a local flair\u2014a sort of authenticity, an interest in conforming or assimilating to the environment that said hotel exists in. That\u2019s what makes it special to go to one hotel over another in certain part of the world.\n\nWhich hotels have stood out?\n\nKempinski Hotels do a really good job of metamorphosizing into different versions. I\u2019ve experienced Kempinski in Kenya, both in Nairobi and the Masai Mara. I\u2019ve also stayed in the Kempinski in Accra, and they\u2019re so different. I like that about that particular company.\n\nAlso in Ghana I visited a little cottage hotel in Elmina called Mable\u2019s Table. They\u2019re like caba\u00f1as by the beach. That hotel started off as just an eatery, a restaurant near the Elmina Castle, and then it branched out to cater to people who wanted to stay the night\u2013so there\u2019s an organic growth that it went through. I also like that as well\u2014a little bit of the high and a little bit of the rustic. It\u2019s a different kind of luxury. But the one thing I definitely don\u2019t like at all is camping.\n\nSign up for Robb Report's Newsletter. For the latest news, follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram."}}
