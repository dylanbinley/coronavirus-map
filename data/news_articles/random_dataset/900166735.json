Especially in Montana where the first celebration was in 1991.\n\nRachel Carroll Rivas with the Montana Human Rights Network spoke about the history of the holiday in Montana.\n\n\u201c29 years ago, passed Doctor King Day as a holiday. We were the second to the last state behind Arizona to pass the holiday. And it actually was really the first piece of public policy that the Montana Human Rights Network worked on.\u201d\n\nEven last week Governor Bullock volunteered his time to read to students as part of the \u201cRead for Peace,\u201d event put together by Montana AmeriCorps.\n\n32 schools across 10 Montana communities participated this year.\n\nThe book Bullock read told a brief overview of the civil rights movement, starting with Rosa Parks' and Doctor King's work.\n\nThe Governor was excited to hear the reactions of the students, \u201cIt's good to hear, as the kids are saying, \u2018What does service mean? What does helping someone mean?\u2019 Certainly, those are things that teachers are helping them understand each and every day. But it's great for them to really think about it in the context of MLK.\u201d\n\nCarroll-Rivas also explained the importance of these celebrations and what they bring to Montanans. \u201cKing celebrations are often a mix of arts and culture because that is an important piece of kind of bringing the story to us but they also include really new voices and new activists for civil rights.\u201d\n\nShe also added, \u201cIn Great Falls, Helena\u2019s mayor Wilmont Collins will be sharing about his work today, as a black person in Montana and his work to promote civil rights\u2026Change doesn't happen on its own and it\u2019s going to take each of us engaging. You know we can\u2019t wait until tomorrow. \u201c\n\nMTN\u2019s Tim McGonigal spoke with Stephanie Schnider with the University of Providence and Pastor Marcus Collins of Great Falls.\n\nCollins said King's legacy lives on through powerful social movements, \u201cThere's sometimes where we have great movements like diversity movements, hashtag me too movement, black lives matter, just various movements that come that different groups of people are letting their voices be heard. And so, if we can just go with the flows of when those different voices speak out and just hear the heart of each individual group, I think we will make great strides.\u201d"}}
