The portion of children born out of wedlock dropped in 2018 for the first time in 20 years and further decreased since.\n\nThe number of both deaths and births decreased by about 3 percent compared to the first six months of last year.\n\nThe number of weddings increased by nearly 600 to 22,433 and the number of divorces decreased to 12,155, compared to the period from January to June 2018.\n\nIn the first six months of the year, 21,232 people moved in Prague \u2013 10,236 from other Czech regions and 10,996 from abroad. At the same time, 15,903 moved out of the city, including 6,307 who moved abroad. The number of childbirths (7,178) was higher than that of deaths (6,063). The city had 1,315,076 inhabitants at the end of June, or 6,444 more than at the end of last year.\n\nkva/dr/rtj"}}
