In contrast, the U.S. comments and actions are neither based on facts, nor helpful at this particular time,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a statement.\n\nWhile the WHO has advised against any travel restrictions, Hua said the U.S. has decided to act \u201cin the opposite way,\u201d setting a bad example.\n\n\u201cIt is certainly not a gesture of goodwill,\u201d she added.\n\nAustralia has also followed suit, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying the country will deny entry to all foreign nationals traveling from mainland China from Saturday.\n\nIn its updated guidance for international movement, the WHO said it advises that measures to limit the risk of exportation or importation of the disease should be implemented, without unnecessary restrictions of international traffic.\n\nThe WHO doesn\u2019t recommend limiting trade and movement, the agency\u2019s director-general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reiterated in a tweet Friday.\n\n\u201cTravel restrictions can cause more harm than good by hindering information sharing and medical supply chains, and harming economies. We urge countries and companies to make evidence-based, consistent decisions,\u201d he said.\n\nSeven people have been diagnosed with the infection in the U.S. so far, with the latest case announced Friday in California. The husband of one of those patients has also been diagnosed with the illness \u2014 the first evidence that the new virus has spread person-to-person in the U.S.\n\nThe virus is believed to have originated in Wuhan, an industrial center of 11 million people and capital of China's central Hubei province.\n\nOn Friday, China\u2019s foreign ministry said that in view of the difficulties Chinese nationals from Hubei province, and especially Wuhan, have encountered overseas in recent days, the Chinese government has decided to send chartered flights to bring them back directly to Wuhan as soon as possible.\n\nThe State Department on Thursday warned Americans not to travel to China and advised those already in the country to leave.\n\nAround two dozen countries have now confirmed cases of the virus, but no deaths have been reported so far.\n\nA number of international air carriers have temporarily suspended flights to China because of dropping demand and safety precautions."}}
