Even more shockingly, some government agencies have actually taken or attempted to take some \u2018deep state-style\u2019 actions against me based on those \u2018fictions\u2019. This is the real woe of Australia and where the actual risk lies for the country.\u201d\n\nHuang said he was never a spy or an \u201cagent of influence\u201d of the Chinese Communist party.\n\n\u201cOver the years, some representatives of the \u2018deep state\u2019 in Australia have repeatedly accused me of being an \u2018agent of influence\u2019. Yet, despite years of stringent investigation on me, the Asio had to eventually admit that there was not even a hair of evidence for such allegation.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian has sought an interview with Huang over a number of matters, both in Australia and overseas. He provided a statement \u2013 in English and Chinese \u2013 overnight.\n\nDespite his exile from Australia, Huang has remained starkly prominent in public and political debate over Chinese government influence in the country.\n\nLast month the Independent Commission Against Corruption heard evidence that he had given an illegal $100,000 donation to the New South Wales Labor party delivered in cash in an Aldi shopping bag to the party\u2019s general secretary. Huang was banned from donating because he was a property developer but the donation was allegedly masked because it was funnelled through a series of fake donors.\n\nSimultaneously, though unrelated, the ATO has launched a federal court bid over an alleged unpaid $140m tax bill, arguing before the federal court that Huang \u201cgrossly understated\u201d his income to avoid tax. The tax office says Huang has moved nearly $50m out of Australia since he was banned from the country. The ATO says the billionaire does not have enough assets in Australia to pay the bill and may move to bankrupt him to retrieve the debt.\n\nHuang arrived in Australia in 2011 \u2013 establishing the Yuhu Group property development firm in 2012 \u2013 and assiduously cultivated influence with both sides of Australian politics during this time in the country, donating at least $2.7m to both the Liberal and Labor parties and appearing in photographs with prime ministers and ministers.\n\nHis permanent residency visa was summarily cancelled last December by the Morrison government on character grounds and his application for Australian citizenship withdrawn. The Asio boss, Duncan Lewis, warned both Labor and the Coalition in 2015 against accepting any more money from Huang, arguing that his close links with the Chinese Communist party meant his beneficence would come with expectations of access and influence.\n\nOf particular concern was Huang\u2019s long-running involvement with the Australian Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China, which has been accused of being a front for Chinese government efforts to expand its global influence.\n\nHuang was also the central figure in the downfall of the Labor senator Sam Dastyari, who was forced to resign from parliament after revelations he had asked Huang for money to pay personal legal bills and warned the tycoon he was under surveillance.\n\nLuxury $550m Sydney waterfront project under a cloud after Huang Xiangmo hit with tax bill Read more\n\nHuang also remains involved in a stalled development at one of the most prominent addresses in Australia, One Circular Quay. Work on the $550m apartment and hotel development has ground to a halt, with industry sources saying there is no builder for the project.\n\nHuang said the tax office\u2019s case against him was politically motivated.\n\n\u201cPaying taxes according to law is a fundamental tenet that I have never once failed as an honest businessman,\u201d he said. \u201cThis holds true throughout my personal and business life in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Australia. My reputation is as precious as life itself. Never have I ever had any history of default anywhere, let alone any record of tax evasion.\u201d\n\nHuang said he always been \u201cproactive and cooperative\u201d with the tax office, and transparent in his declarations. The case is due to return to court tomorrow.\n\n\u201cThe ATO is believed to be a professional government agency with some integrity but it really pains and saddens me that it has now surrendered itself to the pressure of some unknown dark forces, almost allowing itself to become a tool for political persecution against me.\u201d\n\nHuang said the tax office had made errors in assessing his tax debt, based on how it evaluated properties he owned in China. He said this led to a \u201csensationally high\u201d tax bill.\n\n\u201cBy taking advantage of its tax collection power for the purpose of political character assassination and persecution, the ATO has turned into a \u2018political weapon\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe ATO has sought and won a worldwide freeze on all of Huang\u2019s assets while it pursues the alleged tax bill.\n\nHuang Xiangmo pulls nearly $50m out of Australia as tax office chases $140m Read more\n\nIn making the freezing order, Justice Anna Katzmann told the federal court: \u201cThe results of the audit indicate an intention to avoid paying tax by grossly understating income \u2026 these circumstances demonstrate that Mr Huang has both a motive and the means to dissipate his Australian assets.\u201d\n\nHuang said he suspected that the ATO\u2019s action was \u201ca political tool to facilitate some dark forces in an attempt to ruin my reputation, cut off my business network and intimidate my business partners\u201d and complained that it had followed the government\u2019s decision in December to tear up his permanent residency.\n\n\u201cATO\u2019s dramatic act not only contradicts its usual practices as a professional agency but also transcends the professional competence and ethical tolerance of ATO personnel involved in previous communications and with knowledge of the case,\u201d Huang said.\n\n\n\n\u201cFirst to deprive me of my residency on groundless allegations, then a further attempt to seize my assets with unfounded claims \u2013 this is an egregious abuse of power that sends chills down my spine as I would never have expected it of Australia, a country ruled by law, supposedly,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ATO said it could not comment on the affairs of specific taxpayers, nor on a matter currently before court. But it defended its independence and integrity.\n\n\u201cThe ATO administers the taxation and superannuation laws fairly \u2026 when we collect revenue or make payments, we operate in a fair, professional and responsible way,\u201d a tax office spokesman said.\n\n\u201cThe ATO operates under the common law principle of natural justice, to act fairly and without perceived or actual bias.\n\n\u201cWe are responsible for ensuring everyone meets their obligations under these laws, so those who pay or claim the correct amounts are not disadvantaged by those who do not.\u201d\n\n\n\n"}}
