REUTERS/Amir Cohen/File Photo\n\nThe move, announced in a tweet by Greenblatt, keeps the plan\u2019s details from becoming an issue in the election, in which the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, is at stake.\n\n\u201cWe have decided that we will not be releasing the peace vision (or parts of it) prior to the Israeli election,\u201d Greenblatt said on Twitter.\n\nTrump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner has been working behind the scenes on the plan to resolve the decades-old Israeli Palestinian conflict, although Palestinians, who say the Trump administration is too pro-Israel, say it is dead in the water.\n\nA goal to raise tens of billions of dollars to fund the plan was announced earlier this year, but the political details have remained under wraps, with Kushner refusing to say even whether it would offer Palestinians a state of their own.\n\nTrump on Monday had said the plan might be revealed before the Israeli election.\n\nAt a campaign rally on Wednesday, Netanyahu said he expected the U.S. proposal would not be delayed for much longer.\n\n\u201cThis evening we learned that President Trump\u2019s \u2018deal of century\u2019 would be published and presented to the world after the election. I can reasonably estimate that it will happen very soon after the election,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\nPeace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014. The Palestinians seek to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital, areas Israel captured in a 1967 war. Israel moved troops and settlers out of Gaza in 2005 and still occupies the West Bank.\n\nTrump\u2019s Middle East team, including Kushner, had wanted to roll out the plan during the summer but Netanyahu\u2019s failure to put together a governing coalition after April elections prompted a delay.\n\nNetanyahu now faces a fresh vote on Sept. 17 and, if successful, will try again to form a coalition.\n\nAnnouncing a peace plan before Sept. 17 could have complicated a tight race in which Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing Likud party and its strongest rival - Blue and White, led by former armed forces chief Benny Gantz - are running neck and neck in the polls.\n\nNetanyahu has praised Trump policy moves such as the transfer of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and its annexation of the occupied Golan Heights.\n\nBut any perceived concessions towards the Palestinians in the peace plan in the run-up to a ballot only three weeks away could have harmed Netanyahu\u2019s chances of remaining in office.\n\nNetanyahu has campaigned for votes partly by highlighting his close relationship with Trump, whom he has featured on election billboards.\n\n\u201cWho do you want to negotiate with President Trump on the \u2018deal of the century\u2019?\u201d Netanyahu asked the crowd at Wednesday\u2019s rally. \u201cMe, at the head of a right-wing and Likud government, or Gantz and (Blue and White co-leader Yair) Lapid?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the question in this election, because we will be faced, full force, with the (peace) issue in a few weeks\u2019 time.\u201d\n\nThe White House in June announced the economic piece of the Trump peace plan and sought support for it at a conference of global finance ministers in Bahrain.\n\nIt proposes a $50 billion investment plan that would create a global investment fund to lift the Palestinian and neighbouring Arab state economies, and fund a $5 billion transportation corridor to connect the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nGulf leaders, however, want to see details of the political plan before signing on to the economic plan."}}
