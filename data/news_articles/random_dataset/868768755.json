They know that they\u2019re getting jobs. They know that their wages are (rising). They know that their businesses are expanding. They\u2019re not going to walk away from that. And the Democrats are hoping for a recession, which in my mind is so reprehensible. That means they\u2019re actually hoping for people to lose their jobs and businesses to close. That is awful.\u201d\n\nHer remarks came Monday during a business roundtable organized by the Ohio Republican Party and the Trump campaign to \u201cshowcase how President Trump\u2019s economy continues to work for Ohio\u2019s business community and families alike.\u201d\n\nThe event, open to the press but not the public, took place at the main office of logistics, warehouse and trucking company Peoples Services, whose CEO Doug Sibila is a past Republican National Convention delegate.\n\nSibila talked about how Trump\u2019s policies had helped increase his company\u2019s sales by more than 50 percent the past three years, allowed Peoples Services to double its capital spending and allowed it to give its employees hefty raises while adding about 250 workers to a staff that now totals about 800.\n\nHoping for failure?\n\nTimken referred to comments made last year by Bill Maher, host of HBO show \u201cReal Time With Bill Maher,\u201d where she said he and others were \u201cgleefully hoping for a recession.\u201d\n\nMaher in a panel discussion said, \u201cYes, a recession would be very worth getting rid of Donald Trump and these kinds of policies,\u201d according to the Hill, which said Maher said in June 2018 on his show that, \u201cSorry, if that hurts people, but it\u2019s either root for a recession or you lose your democracy.\u201d\n\nOne of the roundtable\u2019s panelists, Fred Horner, president and CEO of Advanced Industrial Roofing in Massillon, said, \u201cThat sounds like you (the Democrats) want people to lose their jobs, lose their livelihood. Destroy their families.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly for power,\u201d said Timken.\n\nThe Ohio Democratic Party later released a statement from its chairman, David Pepper.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it isn\u2019t Democrats talking about the potential of a recession \u2014 it\u2019s 74 percent of economists who expect one by the end of 2021,\u201d the statement said. It said Trump\u2019s package of policies \u201cencourages corporations to outsource jobs. \u2026 Now they\u2019re laying off thousands of American workers and shuttering plants, including the GM factory in Lordstown. Ohio small businesses and farmers are starting to feel the negative impact of Trump\u2019s trade war.\u201d\n\nSays economy strong\n\nHorner said his company works with manufacturers such as Firestone that are running their factories seven days a week, 24 hours a day to meet demand for industrial commercial materials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s booming. People are expanding. People are taking their money and reinvesting it,\u201d said Horner, who added that Advanced Industrial Roofing has a backlog of orders into next year. \u201cThere\u2019s no sign at all of things slowing down.\u201d\n\nTiffany Meyer, a real estate agent for Howard Hanna Realty and member of the Ashland County Republican Party, said, \u201cwe haven\u2019t seen a [downturn] in the real estate market at all. We have seen a great uptick.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the prospect of the Trump administration\u2019s trade war with China causing a recession, U.S. Rep. Bob Gibbs, another panelist, said he didn\u2019t believe that would happen.\n\nThen he said the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which China is not a party to, is a good deal that would increase economic growth and has support from environmentalists, manufacturers, farmers and workers, and Congress would approve it if put up for a vote.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s (U.S. House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi, the Democrats who are stopping it,\u201d Timken said.\n\nTrade deals\n\nGibbs cited Trump\u2019s announcement Sunday that he had reached a trade agreement in principle with Japan and that a final deal could be signed in December. The Trump administration did not release details.\n\nThe congressman said the U.S. could reach a trade deal with the United Kingdom with its departure from the European Union now scheduled for Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cAnd China wants to come back to the table and talk because China is hurting. And what\u2019s really hurting China is we see a lot of businesses pull their supply chains out of China \u2026\" said Gibbs, R-Lakeville. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget what China was doing to us in the past. They were cheating. They were stealing our intellectual property. They weren\u2019t playing fair. And nobody until this president, President Trump, decided to take them on. \u2026 We just had way too much wealth being transferred to China in an unfair way and let\u2019s let our American businesses and American workers have a level playing field to compete with China\"\n\nGibbs said once uncertainty, which is causing volatility in the stock market, is removed with the U.S. concluding trade deals like USMCA especially once \u201cChina comes around\u201d you\u2019ll \u201csee this American economy really take off.\u201d\n\nHorner said that Trump \u201cstanding up, playing hardball is so important. Because they\u2019re not going to leave the United States. We are the strongest economy.\u201d\n\nTimken said, \u201cThey need us.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the discussion, she said Trump\u2019s policies of tax cuts and deregulation had led to \u201cincredible\u2019 job creation and record low unemployment that was pulling people out of poverty.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats are out there talking about recessing. And they want to talk about the economy. Well bring it on,\u201d said Timken. \u201cThe Democrats can talk about the economy. But what are they really talking about? Socialism. They\u2019re talking about government takeover of business. And that message is a losing message.\u201d\n\nReach Robert Wang at 330-580-8327 or robert.wang@cantonrep.com.\n\nOn Twitter: @rwangREP."}}
