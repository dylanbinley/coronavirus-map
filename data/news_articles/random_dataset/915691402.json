Gift cards are then provided to community organizations, including Neighbors in Need, Faith Coalition, Glen-Ed Pantry, Edwardsville NAACP and the Main Street Community Center, that are able to distribute them directly to residents in need. Gift cards have also been provided to Southern Illinois University Edwardsville to assist students who remain on campus.\n\nSara Berkbigler, executive director of Main Street Community Center, praised the program.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful to the city of Edwardsville for providing us with gift certificates for local restaurants,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of these have already been distributed to seniors living in their own homes \u2013 and the rest will be distributed Wednesday to seniors who live at the May Building. The certificates not only help our local restaurants, but also provide a wonderful meal or two for our local seniors who are sheltering at home.\u201d\n\nMore than 100 gift cards have been purchased from our local restaurants.\n\n\u201cThe generosity of our community never ceases to amaze me,\u201d said Jeanne Wojcieszak, city clerk.\n\n\u201cI ask all our residents to continue to support our local restaurants by either buying a gift card for themselves to use in the future, purchasing a gift card and donating it to our Feed the Community Program, or sending a monetary donation to our program,\u201d said Patton. \u201cOur locally-owned restaurants have made Edwardsville into a Foodie Town. Let\u2019s show them our support.\u201d\n\nThe city continues to accept monetary donations for the program. Checks, cash or gift cards can be placed in the after-hours drop box located at city hall or mailed to the city clerk\u2019s office at 118 Hillsboro, P.O Box 407, Edwardsville, Illinois 62025. Credit cards are also accepted by calling (618) 692-7500."}}
