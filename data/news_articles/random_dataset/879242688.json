There are already 20 paid staffers on the ground here, with a goal of about 100 by next year. The last time, Trump\u2019s campaign said, they had only one employee on their payroll in Minnesota, and he was transferred to Colorado before Election Day.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a state that allows us to be on the offensive,\u201d said Kayleigh McEnany, national press secretary for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. \u201cDemocrats need Minnesota. Is there a path [to the White House] without Minnesota? That\u2019s a question for them, I guess.\u201d\n\nWith tears running down their cheeks Brooklyn Hanneman, left, of Lino Lakes and Katie Bohn from Centerville watched President Donald Trump speak Thursday at Target Center in Minneapolis.\n\nTrump campaign officials are looking at Minnesota much the same way as Pennsylvania, where the president won on strong performances in counties outside of the metro areas of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s emergence as a competitive state in 2020 was evident in the hours before Trump\u2019s visit. Vice President Mike Pence, his wife, Karen, and Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, each came to town for a string of events. Earlier in the week, a coalition between the campaign and the Republican National Committee trained about 100 volunteers in Anoka, part of an initiative to deploy more than 1,000 workers in the state.\n\n\u201cIt shows a level of commitment that we haven\u2019t seen from national Republicans in decades,\u201d said Alex Conant, a Minnesotan who is now a Republican strategist in Washington and previously worked on presidential campaigns for Marco Rubio and Tim Pawlenty.\n\nKen Martin, chair of the Minnesota DFL Party, said the Trump campaign\u2019s actions in Minnesota are no mere \u201chead fake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a real serious play to win this state,\u201d Martin said. Democrats are raising the alarm, while Republicans are waxing hopeful.\n\nMartin acknowledges that Trump\u2019s strength in Minnesota in 2016 took Democrats by surprise, an advantage Republicans won\u2019t have this time. But he questioned Trump\u2019s strategic path to victory. For one, Martin said, Trump must find out how to make up some 45,000 votes \u2014 a task made taller by the move toward Democrats in last year\u2019s congressional and legislative elections in some of the same suburban and exurban areas Trump won in 2016.\n\nTrump\u2019s visit previewed the role he\u2019s poised to play in other races in the state next year. As the president stepped off Air Force One, he was greeted by several state GOP politicians with much on the line next year. That included state Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-Nisswa, who\u2019s defending a slim GOP majority in the upper chamber; and former U.S. Rep. Jason Lewis, now running against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tina Smith.\n\n\u201cLook, this is going to be ground zero,\u201d Lewis said in an interview Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fascinating. I do think Minnesota in many ways is going to be a microcosm of the country.\u201d\n\nLewis said the deepening chasm between urban and rural voters reflects a broader nationwide trend, one he intends to seize on by making a hard play for the state\u2019s increasingly conservative Eighth Congressional District in northern Minnesota while trying to limit Democratic strength in the suburbs.\n\nGazelka\u2019s soft-spoken demeanor makes for a marked contrast to Trump. But as he maps out a strategy for holding the state Senate, Gazelka said he plans to run with Trump and \u201cpoint to the substance of what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nMinnesota Republicans lost ground in the suburbs in 2018, and Gazelka said he\u2019s honing his pitch for what\u2019s become the state\u2019s main political battleground.\n\n\u201cWhat are the things he\u2019s doing, and do you like that?\u201d Gazelka said of Trump. \u201cAnd if you like that, I\u2019m going to encourage them that\u2019s enough to vote for him.\u201d\n\nJennifer DeJournett, a GOP operative in Maple Grove, said Trump\u2019s campaign needs to compete in suburban areas where Republicans lost ground last year. She praised the campaign\u2019s early work getting out the vote in reliably Republican rural areas and regional centers but urged them to ramp up tailored messages to suburban voters that highlight positive economic news.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t lose epically in the cities, underperform in the suburbs and expect greater Minnesota to carry you over,\u201d said DeJournett, who was data director for Republican Jeff Johnson\u2019s 2018 campaign for governor.\n\nA Trump campaign operation has been up and running since June, focusing on Twin Cities-area congressional districts represented by DFL Reps. Ilhan Omar and Betty McCollum, both liberal stalwarts.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to win those districts, we just need to incrementally turn out the vote higher than we have in the past,\u201d said Minnesota Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Carnahan. \u201cIf we\u2019re adding 3,000, 4,000 more votes, that is the difference in statewide races.\u201d\n\nDemocrats remain less convinced that Trump can win over undecided or independent voters. Some of those voters, put off by party politics, may opt to stay home because they\u2019re fed up with the excessive partisanship.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s that many that are really on the fence,\u201d said Steve Monk of Rochester, a DFL leader in Olmsted County. \u201c[Trump] doesn\u2019t really speak beyond the base so [his rally] wasn\u2019t really doing anything to bring in anybody new.\u201d\n\nLewis, a former conservative talk radio host, has often been compared to the president for his bombastic political style. He described his campaign as \u201cin sync\u201d with Trump and predicted multiple return visits by the president before the 2020 election.\n\nLewis is banking on winning over a chunk of the electorate he sees as alienated by the leftward tilt of the Democratic Party. Republicans sought to accentuate that point by railing against the anti-Trump protests around the Target Center.\n\nCalculations are also likely to further adjust depending on who takes the Democratic nomination \u2014 a more centrist candidate like former Vice President Joe Biden, or one of the more progressive candidates such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nSaid Kenza Hadj-Moussa, communications director for progressive organizing group TakeAction Minnesota: \u201cPolitics are all about energy, and people are starting to see which campaigns are bringing that.\u201d\n\nStaff writers Judy Keen and Jessie Van Berkel contributed to this report."}}
