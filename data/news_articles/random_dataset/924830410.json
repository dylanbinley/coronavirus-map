Our intention was just to use him to get ransom, but things went bad when he saw our faces. So one of us suggested that we kill and bury him. After killing him, we buried him beside our house so that nobody will know.\n\n\u201cThe Benz you see was bought by one of us (Suleiman Jamilu, one of the kidnappers) with money from the N5 million ransom we got from the doctor.
