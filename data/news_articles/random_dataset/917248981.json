The region still has an amber light, according to VMware\u2019s status page. That dashboard has, for the last few days, offered only the following information about the issue: \u201cThe VMware Engineering team continues to work on adding new hosts and a fix on this issue.\u201d\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t disruptive. Current clients\u2019 workloads run unimpaired. And constraints in a single Australian availability zone won\u2019t inconvenience the majority of VMware customers.\n\nYet it\u2019s now more than two weeks since VMware first started adding hosts, and Australia takes a four-day Easter break. Which means that unless some VMware engineers are willing to skip their seasonal chocolates, this one could stretch into a fourth week.\n\nWe've asked VMware to explain the delays and await a response.\n\nIn other VMware news, the company has released a new edition of NSX-T, the cut of its network virtualisation suite aimed at carrier and multi-cloud operations and which runs without requiring its vSphere compute virtualisation products.\n\nNSX-T 3.0 adds a new \u201cNSX Federation\u201d that allows definition of network policies and automatically implementing them even as workloads move between on-prem and public cloud infrastructure. The new cut is also VMware\u2019s preferred way to handle Kubernetes\u2019 networking requirements if you adopt the new vSphere with K8s. \u00ae\n\nUPDATE: 01:15 GMT, April 11. VMware's advised customers that the incident is over with a terse: \"This incident has been resolved. This is the final update.\""}}
