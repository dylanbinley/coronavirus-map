You should exercise a high degree of caution at all times, monitor local media and follow the instructions of local authorities.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau spent three days in Addis Ababa last month attending the African Union Summit, drumming up support for Canada\u2019s bid to win a United Nations Security Council seat later this year.\n\nHe promised an investment agreement with Ethiopia and $10 million to help empower African women.\n\nCanadian Humanitarian\u2019s website says the organization obtained its licence as a charitable NGO in Ethiopia in 2012.\n\nWith files from CBC (Sarah Rieger), CTV (Nicole Bogart), Canadian Press"}}
