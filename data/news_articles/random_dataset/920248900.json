We cannot allow that to happen.\u201d\n\nDuring the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009, there was criticism that distribution of vaccines was not equitable as wealthier countries were able to purchase more.\n\n\u201cWe must make sure that people who need them get them,\u201d said Peter Sands, head of the Global Fund to Fight on AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. \u201cThe lessons from AIDS must be learned. Too many millions died before anti-retroviral medicines were made widely accessible.\u201d\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the objective at a global pledging effort on May 4 would be to raise 7.5 billion euros ($8.10 billion) to ramp up work on prevention, diagnostics and treatment.\n\n\u201cThis is a first step only, but more will be needed in the future,\u201d von der Leyen told the conference.\n\n\u201cCOMMON FIGHT\u201d\n\nLeaders from Asia, the Middle East and the Americas also joined the videoconference, but several big countries did not participate, including China, India and Russia.\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. mission in Geneva had earlier told Reuters that the United States would not be involved.\n\n\u201cAlthough the United States was not in attendance at the meeting in question, there should be no doubt about our continuing determination to lead on global health matters, including the current COVID crisis,\u201d he said by email.\n\n\u201cWe remain deeply concerned about the WHO\u2019s effectiveness, given that its gross failures helped fuel the current pandemic,\u201d he later said.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has lambasted the WHO as being slow to react to the outbreak and being \u201cChina-centric\u201d and announced a suspension of funding.\n\nTedros has steadfastly defended the WHO\u2019s handling of the pandemic and repeatedly committed to conducting a post-pandemic evaluation, as the agency does with all crises.\n\nMacron, Merkel, Ramaphosa, and Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez were among those voicing strong support to WHO.\n\nMacron urged all G7 and G20 countries to get behind the initiative, adding: \u201cAnd I hope we\u2019ll manage to reconcile around this joint initiative both China and the U.S., because this is about saying \u2018the fight against COVID-19 is a common human good and there should be no division in order to win this battle\u2019.\u201d\n\nMerkel said: \u201cThis concerns a global public good, to produce this vaccine and to distribute it in all parts of the world.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa, chairman of the African Union, warned that the continent - with its generally poor standards of healthcare - was \u201cextremely vulnerable to the ravages of this virus and is in need of support\u201d.\n\nVACCINE TRIALS\n\nMore than 2.7 million people have been infected with COVID-19 and nearly 190,000 have died from it since the new coronavirus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, according to a Reuters tally.\n\n\u201cAs new diagnostics, treatments and vaccines become available, we have a responsibility to get them out equitably with the understanding that all lives have equal value,\u201d said Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation, which was WHO\u2019s second largest donor last year.\n\nMore than 100 potential COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, including six already in clinical trials, said Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of the GAVI vaccine alliance, a public-private partnership that leads immunisation campaigns in poor countries.\n\n\u201cWe need to ensure that there are enough vaccines for everyone, we are going to need global leadership to identify and prioritise vaccine candidates,\u201d he told a Geneva news briefing.\n\nYuan Qiong, senior legal and policy advisor at Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Access Campaign welcomed the pledges but called for concrete steps. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any patent monopoly and profiteering out of this pandemic,\u201d she told Reuters."}}
