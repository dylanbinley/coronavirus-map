Kalburgi and journalist Gauri Lankesh\u2019 and \u2018Lal Salaam (red salute)\u2019, while carrying photos of the slain intellectuals.\n\n\u201cEven after five long years, there seems to be no indication that the State government is serious in bringing the masterminds of Mr. Pansare\u2019s murder to book. Till the real perpetrators of the murder are arrested, we will continue to protest on the streets,\u201d said veteran socialist activist Dr. N.D. Patil.\n\nMr. Pansare, along with his wife Uma, were repeatedly shot at close range in Kolhapur\u2019s Sagar Mal locality on February 16, 2015.\n\nWhile Ms. Pansare survived the murderous attack, her husband succumbed to his wounds in Mumbai\u2019s Breach Candy Hospital on February 20.\n\nNine people have been named in Mr. Pansare\u2019s murder so far including Sarang Akolkar and Vinay Pawar, two absconding activists of the Sanatan Sanstha, who the agencies earlier alleged to have carried out the actual shooting of Mr. Pansare.\n\nIn June 2017, a Kolhapur court, after three rejections, had finally accorded conditional bail to Sanatan Sanstha activist Sameer Gaikwad, who was picked up from Sangli district in western Maharashtra in September 2015 \u2014 the first arrest in the Pansare case.\n\nIn January 2018, the Kolhapur sessions court had granted conditional bail to radical Hindutva activist and ENT specialist Dr. Virendra Tawde \u2014 named as the \u2018mastermind\u2019 in Dr Dabholkar\u2019s murder \u2014 in connection with his suspected role in the killing of the veteran Communist leader.\n\nAccording to probe agencies, Dr. Tawde is a crucial link to the murders of Pansare and Dr. Dabholkar. The SIT\u2019s supplementary charge sheet even names Dr. Tawde as \u2018mastermind\u2019 in the Pansare murder, suspecting him of conducting the reconnaissance before the murder.\n\nIn November 2018, Amol Kale, a key accused in the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh, was arrested by the SIT in connection with Mr. Pansare\u2019s murder. Amit Degwekar, another co-accused in the Gauri Lankesh case, too, had been arrested by the SIT probing the Pansare murder.\n\nIn June last year, the SIT had arrested and interrogated Sharad Kalaskar, alleged to be the second sharpshooter who shot Dr. Dabholkar, in connection with Mr. Pansare\u2019s murder. In September 2019, Sachin Andure, the second assailant in the Dabholkar case, was also questioned regarding the Pansare murder before being sent to judicial custody."}}
