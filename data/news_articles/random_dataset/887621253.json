He said the Vietnamese government was offering to pay only the costs of bringing the bodies \u201chome from the airport\u201d.\n\nHe said the government would rather bring back ashes post-cremation, but the families had all asked for the bodies to be returned intact.\n\nCuong said the Vietnamese government was prepared pay in advance on behalf of the families, who would then have to repay the debt.\n\n\u201cWe hope the Vietnamese community in the UK supports these families both in spirit and materials because they are in real difficulty now,\u201d he said. \u201cMany families have to take out loans to pay for their children, and these costs make their lives very hard.\u201d\n\nPham Van Thin, the father of Pham Thi Tra My, whose text saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry mum \u2026 I\u2019m dying because I can\u2019t breathe\u201d gave the first clue that the victims were Vietnamese, said local officials had visited him and relayed the government\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThey gave me a document saying the two governments will not pay for repatriation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey offered two options: receiving ashes or the body. For the first option, we have to pay 41,100,000 Vietnam dong (\u00a31,370), while we have to pay for 66,240,000 Vietnam dong (\u00a32,209) for the body.\u201d\n\nMany of the families built up crippling debt trying to fund a better life for their relatives. \u201cThe cost is out of our family\u2019s capacity to pay now,\u201d Thin said. \u201cWe had to take loans from the bank to pay for her travel, and we still owe the banks.\n\n\u201cBut I have signed a consent form to bring her body back home. We are in a difficult situation now but the government offered us a loan to pay for the cost, and we\u2019ll reimburse the government 30 days after her burial. The government will not take any interest on the loan.\u201d\n\nThin said they are fearful of asking again for help after an appeal by his son had led to accusations of trying to profit from the tragedy.\n\nA document sent by Vietnam\u2019s foreign ministry to officials in central Vietnam states that relatives with financial capability will have to pay for the costs of repatriation upfront. Those in debt will have to take out a loan and sign a form committing to reimburse the government.\n\nIt also says that under Vietnamese law, the cost of repatriating corpses or ashes of loved ones must always be covered by the family, not the government, though it says other individuals can sponsor the cost for families.\n\nThere has been little reporting of the repatriations in Vietnamese media since the government launched a clampdown on coverage of the case two weeks ago. A blogger on Radio Free Asia revealed that Vietnam\u2019s propaganda department had written to newspaper editors asking them to \u201cnot report on identities or situations of families with suspected bereavement\u201d.\n\nNghe An and Ha Tinh provinces, where the majority of victims are from, are a hotspot for human trafficking, according to Blue Dragon Children\u2019s Foundation, which rescues trafficked people from China.\n\nHundreds of Vietnamese people are trafficked to the UK each year, according to the UK-based charity Ecpat. Often they are forced into slavery in nail bars or cannabis farms.\n\nA GoFundMe page has been launched to help pay for the repatriation of the remains."}}
