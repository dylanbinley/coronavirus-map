It\u2019s an effort to picture what the legal marijuana market will look like over the next five years, after spending the past five years largely regulating by reaction as the difficulties of building an industry from infancy absorbed the agency\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve typically been so challenged with the issues of the day we haven\u2019t been looking out long-term to determine what the future looks like,\u201d Garza said.\n\nThe board has been freeing up its bandwidth by coordinating with other agencies to share the responsibility of regulating the market, such as having the Department of Ecology oversee the certification of marijuana testing labs and the Department of Financial Institutions examine the sometimes complicated ownership structures of licensed cannabis businesses.\n\nOne big-picture issue the board could rethink is whether to abandon the state\u2019s seed-to-sale marijuana tracking program, which has long been beset by software issues, sometimes grinding business to a halt, in favor of a system where businesses report their transactions to the board and are then audited. Another is whether to prepare to allow marijuana exports, as Oregon did this year, in the event the federal government approves it.\n\nFor the next session of the Legislature, the board has proposed two bills. One would create what some critics describe as a long-overdue \u201csocial equity\u201d program, encouraging greater ownership of marijuana businesses by minorities, women and military veterans. Part of the rationale of legalizing marijuana in Washington state in 2012 was to remedy the disproportionate effect the drug war has had on people of color, but minority ownership of cannabis businesses in the state remains paltry.\n\nWhile Washington is not currently issuing any more marijuana licenses, 11 of the more than 500 retailers have surrendered their licenses, Garza said. Under the board\u2019s proposal, those could be reissued, or, if cities or counties agree to increase the number of pot shops within their boundaries, new licenses could be granted \u2014 this time, to participants in the social equity program.\n\nBusinesses would be eligible if they are owned by a woman, minority or veteran, or if a majority of its ownership group are members of a \u201cprotected class\u201d under state anti-discrimination law. Applicants would be barred from consideration if any owner already has a majority share of another cannabis retail license.\n\nThe legislation would also create a technical assistance program run by the Department of Commerce that would provide grants totaling at least $100,000 per year to help minority-, woman- or veteran-owned businesses navigate the licensing process, receive compliance and financial training, and buy equipment, software or facilities.\n\nThe Washington CannaBusiness Association, an industry group, said it agrees there is a need for a social equity program, and it\u2019s been working on its own version.\n\n\u201cWe think there\u2019s an opportunity to go even beyond\u201d what the board is proposing, said spokesman Aaron Pickus.\n\nAnother legislative proposal would allow struggling \u201ctier one\u201d producers \u2014 the smallest size, limited to 2,000 square feet (186 square meters) of plants \u2014 to sell medical-grade product directly to the state\u2019s 36,000 registered marijuana patients. The patients have long complained that they have a hard time finding medical-grade cannabis, which must go through additional testing for pesticides and heavy metals, in retail stores, and Garza said the proposal could help the patients while giving the growers an incentive to offer more medically compliant product.\n\nThe tier-one growers could sell to patients onsite, with other growers at indoor farmers-market-style locations, or by delivery, Garza said. Local jurisdictions would have to approve, and to avoid competition with other licensed retailers, the growers or farmers markets would have to be at least 3 miles (4.8 km) away from established retailers.\n\nAny proposal to allow delivery or sales by small growers is certain to be controversial, as other retailers might object to additional competition. Garza said the board will consider industry feedback.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be real concerns by retailers out there,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do that, we\u2019ve got to be cautious.\u201d\n\nEven more significantly for the smallest growers, the board wants to allow them to expand, first to 5,000 square feet (465 square meters) and then possibly to 8,000 square feet (743 square meters). Those producers have long complained the tier-one licenses, designed to ensure craft growers have a place in the market, are so restrictive that they can\u2019t succeed. Though they must make similar investments in security, insurance and product tracking as the largest growers, they are allowed to grow and sell only tiny fraction of what the largest growers produce.\n\nPaige Berger, CEO of Hygge Farms in Onalaska, said she\u2019s excited about the board\u2019s proposal. She initially obtained a tier-one license because she didn\u2019t have enough money to invest in a larger operation. Now, she said, she\u2019s hamstrung by her limited size: She can only produce enough marijuana to have product in 10 licensed cannabis shops.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t get out there and expand my brand to what I think it could do,\u201d Berger said."}}
