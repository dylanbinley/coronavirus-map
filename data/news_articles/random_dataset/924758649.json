A train carrying more than 1,400 labourers left for Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh from Mangaluru Junction on Wednesday (May 21).\n\n\u201cWe have sent a major portion of migrant labourers,\u201d the officer said. The district administration is expecting a special train to Uttar Pradesh. There is need of a train for labourers from Jharkhand who are in Puttur.\n\nWhile as many as 40,510 migrant labourers have registered in the Seva Sindhu portal, the officer said there are many duplicate registrations on the portal. While many have boarded trains from Dakshina Kannada, labourers have also gone to Bengaluru by buses to catch the special trains running regularly. Labourers in Udupi have come to Mangaluru and vice versa to board trains to their places, the officer added."}}
