He has yet to be officially charged.\n\nLast year, an Egyptian court rejected an order by the state prosecutor to release him. Authorities opened a new investigation against him with unspecified charges and returned him to prison.\n\nIn May, the CPJ documented the arrests of at least four Egyptian journalists, including Sameh Haneen, a Coptic Christian who also faces charges of joining a \"terrorist\" organisation.\n\nThe interior ministry later published video footage of an alleged confession by Haneen, in which he claimed he had been paid thousands of dollars for producing videos critical of the government for Al Jazeera at the request of members of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nEgypt and its Gulf allies - Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - have boycotted Qatar since June 2017, accusing it of \"supporting terrorists\" and interfering in its neighbour's affairs, accusations Doha strongly denies.\n\nEgypt ranks as the third-worst jailer of journalists behind China and Turkey, according to the CPJ."}}
