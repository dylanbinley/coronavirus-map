This year, the award ceremony for the Boston/New England Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences will be held virtually, though it\u2019s likely Lawton will still be dressing up for the occasion in case she wins, she said.\n\n\u201cI used to hear people say, \u2018I don\u2019t care if I win,\u2019 and I thought, no, they really care, but now I understand that. I\u2019m so grateful to be nominated,\u201d said Lawton. \u201cJust the fact that we were chosen is amazing.\u201d\n\nEven more amazing for Lawton, she said, is that she\u2019s up against one of her favorite hosts, PBS\u2019 Jim Braude, host of the WGBH show \u201cGreater Boston\u201d and co-host of Boston Public Radio with Fall River native Margery Eagan.\n\n\u201cI love him, I listen to him all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel humbled. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve already won just to be nominated.\u201d\n\nWhile she was thrilled to be nominated as host, Lawton said the nomination is the result of a lot of hard work from the entire production team she worked with to bring \u201cMaria\u2019s Portuguese Table\u201d to the TV screen.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big huge group of people that makes it happen,\u201d she said of the show, filmed by Cineasta Digital Productions.\n\nLawton, an Azorean immigrant who relocated to New Bedford as a child with her parents, said she wanted to showcase the food and culture of her native country through the television series. In the first season of \u201cMaria\u2019s Portuguese Table,\u201d Lawton brings viewers on a journey from Providence to the Azores and California, highlighting Portuguese cuisine and culture and how it has morphed in those places.\n\n\u201cI thought, there isn\u2019t anything out there in the English language that shows our cultures and traditions similar to what other nationalities have out there,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to preserve these recipes and these things for the next generations.\u201d\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, she said planning for the second season of the travel/cooking series was already in the works. But now everything is stalled amid travel bans and social distancing.\n\nThe 8-episode inaugural series of \u201cMaria\u2019s Portuguese Table\u201d kicked off on WSBE in January 2019. Since then it has been picked up by other PBS stations, including those in parts of California and New York. With the nomination, Lawton agreed it might bring exposure to the show, prompting more stations to pick it up.\n\nLawton said she\u2019s heard from people in Canada, specifically Toronto and Montreal, who would like it to air there as well.\n\n\u201cI have amazing fans and followers and they get what I\u2019m trying to do with the show. They feel like they know me and my family. I\u2019m very relatable to them,\u201d she said.\n\nLawton\u2019s relatable personality may lead to her winning an Emmy as host of the series on June 13, but if not, she\u2019s happy to be recognized, she added."}}
