Her statement however boggles the mind and is deeply disturbing.\n\n\u201cFor Ms Jeffress to seek to undermine one of the most mature, well-developed legal systems in the world, which has fairness at its heart, and which many countries around the world have modelled their legal systems on, is unbecoming of any lawyer, let alone someone of her stature.\u201d\n\nMr Seiger urged Ms Sacoolas to \u201cput that defence forward in court here rather than ventilate it publicly\u201d.\n\nMs Patel would not be drawn when asked in October if Ms Sacoolas should be extradited.\n\n\u201cIt very much seems that the lady in question wants to start cooperating with the discussions and the investigations, and I think that we should support that,\u201d she told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr programme.\n\n\u201cWe need to ensure that justice is done but obviously that co-operation with this investigation takes place. That is absolutely right.\u201d"}}
