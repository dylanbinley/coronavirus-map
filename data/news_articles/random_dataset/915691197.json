(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nThere\u2019s much speculation as to why the U.S. president and other officials downplayed the coronavirus threat.\n\nIt could be that President Donald Trump wanted the virus to not be that bad. Or that he wanted to talk the economy out of breaking and messing up his messaging for his 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nAt the daily coronavirus press conference on Monday \u2014 more than 120,000 people have signed a petition to stop those, saying they\u2019re just campaign rallies \u2014 CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta asked Trump why he downplayed the threat posed by the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThe statements I made are I want to keep the country calm, I don\u2019t want panic in the country,\u201d Trump told Acosta. \u201cI could cause panic much better than even you. I could do much \u2014 I would make you look like a minor league player.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attempts to undersell the virus to the public had real-world consequences, \u201cincluding a very slow start to testing for the virus in this country and our current shortages on masks and ventilators,\u201d wrote CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza.\n\nHere are eight times U.S. officials downplayed the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nSpewing happy talk about Covid-19\n\nJust a month ago, top White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told CNBC that he thought the virus was contained in the U.S. even though doctors were warning otherwise. Kudlow was predicting \u201cweeks, not months\u201d of economic turmoil due to the global pandemic.\n\nHe has since changed his mind. ABC host Martha Raddatz reminded Kudlow, who is the director of the National Economic Council, that he downplayed the threat of a long-lasting economic tragedy. \u201cWhy should people trust you?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cNobody could have predicted or expected this,\u201d Kudlow said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Exchange.\u201d\n\nWrong. On Feb. 25, the same day of Kudlow\u2019s comments, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said it wasn\u2019t a matter of if but when. \u201cWe expect we will see community spread in this country.\u201d\n\nDeflecting blame for the fast spread in NYC\n\nLess than three weeks ago, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was still telling New Yorkers to \u201cgo about their lives\u201d as the coronavirus quietly incubated and spread like wildfire in the city\u2019s crowded common areas.\n\nNow de Blasio says it wasn\u2019t his fault \u2014 he was only working with the information he had at the time \u201cand trying to avoid panic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, is that message at least in part to blame for how rapidly the virus has spread across the city?\u201d CNN asked de Blasio on State of the Union.\n\n\u201cWe should not be focusing, in my view, on anything looking back,\u201d de Blasio replied. \u201cThis is just about how we save lives going forward.\u201d New York City feels like a different world now, de Blasio added \u2014 a \u201cwar-time environment.\u201d\n\nBut high-level health experts and officials warned of the huge threat posed by the virus in February.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m worried about the flu,\u2019 the surgeon general tweeted on March 6\n\nAll that official talk about containment? That was just posturing, according to U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams.\n\n\u201cInitially we had a posture of containment so that we could give people time to prepare for where we are right now,\u201d Adams said on March 8 on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cNow we\u2019re shifting into a mitigation phase, which means that we\u2019re helping communities understand you\u2019re going to see more cases. Unfortunately, you\u2019re going to see more deaths, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we should panic.\u201d\n\nOn March 6, in a tweet that has since been removed, Adams tweeted, \u201cEarly am flight. No one with masks (they aren\u2019t recommended for general public) but noticed several people using antibacterial wipes on seats (I do this too). I\u2019m not worried about #COVID19 \u2013 I\u2019m worried about #flu, & the guy reclining all the way back into me before takeoff.\u201d\n\nIf you had a nefarious agenda, Jerome Adams seems perfect for an informational hit man job. Diversity is always good so give the people more COVID-19 in the lungs. Facebook put lobbyist Neil Potts out front & MAGA found Jerome. pic.twitter.com/cscgdpr6m1 \u2014 Jamarlin Martin (@JamarlinMartin) March 29, 2020\n\nThe virus \u2018is being contained\u2019\n\nSenior Trump official and presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway said on March 6 that the virus \u201cis being contained.\u201d She told Fox News that this was so because of Trump\u2019s February travel restrictions on foreign nationals who had recently been to China. \u201cThe President\u2019s swift, substantive and resolute action at the very beginning of this, and his task force working 24/7, really has made the difference in terms of containing this in this country so far,\u201d Conway said. Challenged later by reporters, Conway argued, \u201cIt is being contained\u2026do you not think it\u2019s being contained in this country?\u201d\n\nShe said the number of U.S. deaths attributed to the virus was proof that that the virus has been contained, CNN reported. At the time, at least 17 people had died in the U.S. and more than 330 people had tested positive.\n\nTwenty-five days later on March 31, the U.S. reported 187,347 cases and 3,860 coronavirus deaths.\n\n\u2018I like the numbers being where they are\u2019\n\nWhen the Diamond Princess cruise ship was moored 25 miles off the coast of California with 3,500 people on board, Trump said he\u2019d prefer its sick patients to stay there. The number of passengers who tested positive for coronavirus kept growing.\n\n\u201cI like the numbers being where they are,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault. And it wasn\u2019t the fault of the people on the ship either, okay? It wasn\u2019t their fault either and they\u2019re mostly Americans. So, I can live either way with it. I\u2019d rather have them stay on, personally.\u201d\n\nThat was Trump saying \u201cthe quiet part out loud,\u201d Jake Lahut wrote for Business Insider.\n\nListen to GHOGH with Jamarlin Martin | Episode 70: Jamarlin Martin Jamarlin goes solo to discuss the COVID-19 crisis. He talks about the failed leadership of Trump, Andrew Cuomo, CDC Director Robert Redfield, Surgeon General Jerome Adams, and New York Mayor de Blasio.\n\nShortages? What shortages?\n\nOn March 26, President Donald Trump went on Fox News and said he doesn\u2019t believe there are shortages of medical supplies. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators,\u201d he said, referring to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s pleas for help. The president made the statement in spite of government reports predicting shortages in a severe pandemic, New York Times reported. The next day, just to show that he was in control, Trump called for urgent steps to produce more ventilators.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s going to be just fine\u2019\n\nNo matter how much the count of coronavirus cases has grown, Trump has described it as low.\n\nWhen the first case of the virus was reported in the U.S in January, Trump downplayed it as \u201cone person coming in from China.\u201d He said the situation was \u201cunder control\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s going to be just fine\u201d despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention telling the public to \u201cexpect more cases.\u201d\n\nWith five cases, Trump said in late January, \u201cWe have very little problem in this country.\u201d On March 5, he tweeted, \u201cOnly 129 cases.\u201d By March 12 (more than 1,200 cases), Trump said this was \u201cvery few cases\u201d compared to other countries.\n\n\u2018Enjoy Disneyland,\u2019 CDC director said on March 8\n\nOn March 7, CDC Director Robert Redfield \u2014 the head of the leading national public health institute in the U.S. \u2014 tried to calm down Florida\u2019s tourism industry executives amid growing concern for the massive threat to the state\u2019s economy. Disney Orlando was safe, Redfield said. At the time, there were eight coronavirus cases in Florida \u2014 two, fatal.\n\nJust five days later on March 12, Disney announced that \u201cin an abundance of caution,\u201d it would close its flagship Walt Disney World in Orlando. All 11 Disney theme parks including Disneyland resort in Anaheim, California and Disney in Asia and Europe have since been closed, along with the Disney Cruise Line."}}
