The officers at the scene had just been in a fight with the suspect trying to contain him as he resisted arrest.\n\nAtlanta\u2019s Police Chief Ericka Shields has voluntarily stepped down after the NAACP demanded it.\n\nAtlanta resident Rayshard Brooks, 27, was shot by an officer during a struggle and died after surgery at a local hospital, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.\n\nAtlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms called for the termination of the police officer who shot and killed Rayshard Brooks on Friday.\n\n\u201cI do not believe this was a justified use of deadly force,\u201d she said.\n\nDo they have the right to use force if the accused is a white person? Just wondering.\n\nPolice won\u2019t get a lot of support for defending themselves in dangerous situations in blue cities. Six officers were fired in Atlanta for using their tasers, which the officials called deadly force. Now, when the accused pulls a taser on an officer, they are saying the opposite. Basically, officers are told they can\u2019t defend themselves.\n\nThis is the surveillance video:\n\nThe 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks was allegedly sleeping in his car at a drive-thru which lead to a failed sobriety test, and then a struggle during his arrest. He reportedly grabbed a taser from an officer and aimed it at police, who then fired.pic.twitter.com/RvDmsxzsBC \u2014 Alex Salvi (@alexsalvinews) June 13, 2020\n\nATLANTA PROTESTERS ARE OUT OF CONTROL\n\nProtesters are starting to go out of control.
