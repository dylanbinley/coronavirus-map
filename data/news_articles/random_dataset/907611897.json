The initial plan calls for an end to attacks for seven days and then the signing of a U.S.-Taliban peace deal before all-Afghan peace talks would begin.\n\nAdministration officials have expressed optimism about the plan, but on the heels of meeting with Afghan President Ashaf Ghani at the Munich Security Conference last weekend, the Republicans raised concerns about how the process will work.\n\nTo Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee and a skeptic of past Trump administration drawdown plans, the devil will be in the details.\n\n\u201cAre they real conditions, are you going to enforce them, or is it just window covering for a withdrawal,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll say our military and the Afghan military has brought the Taliban to the table, but will they fundamentally change their ways? Can you really have Afghans in a peaceful society? I\u2019m skeptical.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials have not publicly spelled out their timetable for an initial drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, but the expectation is that a reduction from the current total of about 12,000 to approximately 8,600 will begin after the signing of a U.S.-Taliban deal. The initial reduction is likely to stretch out over a period of weeks or months, and a conditions-based withdrawal to zero troops could follow.\n\n\"If all sides hold up, meet their obligations under that reduction of violence, then we'll start talking about the next part and whether to move forward,\" Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters in Munich.\n\nAs U.S. officials were mum about those conditions, some Republicans cautioned against accepting a bad deal.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., an ally of Trump, reckoned the presence of 8,600 U.S. troops will give Ghani leverage to negotiate the peaceful reintegration of Taliban, while a hasty withdrawal of all U.S. troops would be an immense blunder.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing that can happen for the Trump administration is to push a reconciliation progress of dialogue and outcome, beyond what the market will bear,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIf people think we\u2019re going to leave Afghanistan no matter what, then the Northern Alliance regenerates and the country goes into open civil war. [The Islamic State\u2019s Afghan offshoot] ISIS-K and al-Qaida are the biggest beneficiaries of that, and it will be Iraq on steroids.\u201d\n\nCritics of President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Iraq say the and the subsequent rise of the Islamic State group showed there are practical and political repercussions for how America gets out of a war, just as there are for how it gets into a war.\n\n\u201cA dose of skepticism is healthy and necessary. Nobody wants to be perceived on the wrong side of history on this thing, if it falls apart,\u201d Tom Spoehr, director of the conservative Heritage Foundation\u2019s Center for National Defense, said of reaction to the Taliban talks.\n\nOn the sidelines at Munich, Ghani told lawmakers he was comfortable with a drawdown to 8,600 U.S. troops. That presence, Ghani said, is a matter of homeland security for the United States because Afghanistan\u2019s reversion to Taliban rule would make it a launchpad for terrorist attacks on the U.S.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., a senior Senate Armed Services Committee member who met with Ghani, said the administration should be, \u201cdriving home that the Afghan people overwhelmingly want us to stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil [the Taliban] have some kind of change of heart or they\u2019re marginalized, we\u2019re still there, and I\u2019m comfortable with the United States saying the people of Afghanistan can depend on us for as long as they need us,\u201d Wicker said, adding: \u201cAs a federal legislator, I think that our withdrawal should be conditions based.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the Trump administration believes that, Wicker paused for a full six seconds, then said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just let the administration speak for itself.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}}
