Wong is the sole (and badly needed) face of racial diversity in the mayor\u2019s caucus, despite the fact that more than 30 per cent of Montrealers are members of \u201cvisible minorities.\u201d Wong is Asian, young, knowledgeable on discrimination, and capable of tackling systemic racism in ways that other executive committee members cannot."}}
