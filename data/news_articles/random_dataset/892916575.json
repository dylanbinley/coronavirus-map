They also approached the subject of peace from pragmatic perspectives and wrote about finding financial peace, escaping a toxic relationship, leaving a religious group, and defining a healthy approach to weight management and fitness.\n\n\u201cI admire the depth of personal reflection that is shared in these essays,\u201d said Edison State President Dr. Doreen Larson.\n\nTied for first place in the competition were Clarissa Kiehl, of Piqua, and Joselyn Monet Garner, of Piqua. Tied for second place were Leah Pistone, of Sidney, and Ashley Wiekert, of Troy. Ryan Williams, of Troy, and Liam Dowling, of Lewisburg, tied for third place. Taylor Collins, of Union City, received an honorable mention.\n\nhttps://www.registerherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2019/12/web1_esu_PeaceEssayWinners.jpg"}}
