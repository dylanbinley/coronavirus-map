David Ige\u2019s emergency order.\n\nADVERTISING\n\n\u201cThey will immediately shut down,\u201d Kim said.\n\nThe rule is effective as of 12:01 a.m. Monday. Violators are subject to a misdemeanor charge with penalties of up to a year in jail and a $5,000 fine.\n\nKim said tenants already in rentals will be allowed to finish, but not extend, their rental period.\n\n\u201cI just met with the police chief and we discussed the difficulty of monitoring them,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThey are all here and there and there and here.\u201d\n\nKim said he\u2019ll have staff telephoning as many as the short-term rentals as they can beginning Monday to inform them of the proclamation. Friday was a government holiday.\n\nMore than 200 tourists and \u201cintended residents\u201d have arrived at Kona\u2019s airport since the 14-day quarantine order began, not counting the unknown numbers who\u2019ve come to the Big Island\u2019s two major airports on interisland flights.\n\nThat\u2019s according to daily statistics provided by the Hawaii Tourism Authority, which also counted 2,742 statewide visitors during that same two-week period.\n\nWith most hotels and resorts closed to all but first responders and medical personnel, the bulk of these visitors are ending up in vacation rentals. Some vacation rental operators have advertised their rentals as a great place to ride out the COVID-19 pandemic, which, coupled with cheap flights, has kept a slow, but steady influx of visitors to the state.\n\nThat\u2019s upset some of the neighbors, who\u2019ve been reporting to Kona Councilwoman Rebecca Villegas that tourists are not staying inside, and in fact, become belligerent when it\u2019s pointed out to them that they\u2019re required to be under quarantine. Even calling the police hasn\u2019t helped, said one Facebook poster, who said the tourists near him came right back out into the neighborhood after the police left.\n\nKauai Mayor Derek Kawakami issued an amended emergency proclamation Wednesday ordering all transient vacation rentals and home-stays to immediately cease all activity, including advertising, effective Saturday until May 3.\n\n\u201cWe have seen some alarming data points. Most recent data on incoming flights are showing a slight rise in visitor numbers. Further, some vacation rentals are still actively advertising, including promoting themselves as COVID-19 retreats for people from the mainland,\u201d Kawakami said in a video address. \u201cThis is wrong. It is dangerous for our community, and it cannot continue.\u201d\n\nVillegas has been contemplating legislation as well.\n\nADVERTISING\n\n\u201cI believe the entire Hawaii County Council has equal concerns about the short term vacation rental issue related to COVID-19 and the impossibility of enforcing quarantine restrictions. I am hopeful our administration will follow Mayor Kawakami\u2019s strong directive to close all STVR\u2019s immediately,\u201d Villegas told West Hawaii Today on Friday. \u201cStiff fines may be necessary to encourage compliance.\u201d\n\nEmail Nancy Cook Lauer at ncook-lauer@westhawaiitoday.com."}}
