Kevin Stitt took his children to a \u201cpacked\u201d restaurant Saturday and proudly tweeted to \u201c#supportlocal\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic. He later deleted the tweet.\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) declared \u201cit\u2019s a great time to go to the local restaurant\u201d or to \u201cgo to your local pub\u201d \u2014 not \u201cto the grocery store and buy $4,000 worth of food.\u201d Later that day, California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered pubs closed until further notice.\n\nAnd across the nation, from New York\u2019s Lower East Side to San Francisco\u2019s Mission neighborhood, it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for young people crowded into hot, sticky bars, laughing away coronavirus fears.\n\nSaturday\u2019s night out took place before three states took major steps Sunday to keep the public at home: Newsom mandated the closure of all bars and nightclubs and ordered people ages 65 and older to stay home, while Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued orders closing bars and restaurants with the restaurant ban applying only to dine-in customers.\n\nCities and states late last week began imposing severe restrictions on local businesses and, in some cases, the movement of their citizens. In New Jersey, the mayor of Hoboken, a one-square-mile party town on the Hudson River, imposed a citywide, 10 p.m. curfew and ordered the closures of gyms, theaters and daycare centers. Teaneck, the epicenter of the state\u2019s outbreak, has requested that all residents self-quarantine.\n\nIn New York City, one city councilman has called for a full lockdown of the nation\u2019s largest city, ala France or Italy, and the city council president is demanding a halt to \u201call non-essential services.\u201d A state legislator who is the husband of a city council member has been diagnosed with Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.\n\nThe bars were closed in South Boston Sunday, even with St. Patrick\u2019s Day around the corner. And Washington, D.C. on Sunday imposed restrictions on eateries and drinking halls.\n\nNew Jersey. Gov. Phil Murphy said he\u2019s considering a statewide curfew.\n\n\u201cThis is not business as usual,\u201d Murphy said Sunday during a call with reporters. \u201cAlmost anybody who\u2019s an expert here will tell you the next seven to 14 days will define our country.\u201d\n\nThe patchwork of local and state policies, sure to grow in coming days, will test the limits of the government\u2019s ability to restrict business and the movement of citizens \u2014 and will decide how fast the coronavirus spreads through the nation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is now facing pressure \u2014 even from fellow Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida \u2014 to impose domestic travel restrictions that could help slow the crisis enough for hospitals to keep up with the growing number of patients.\n\nThere were nearly 3,000 confirmed cases of infections in the U.S., resulting in 57 deaths, as of Sunday afternoon, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The number of domestic deaths could soar exponentially into the hundreds of thousands or even millions, federal officials say.\n\nBut many Americans simply aren\u2019t buying into the warnings to stay home. A majority of the respondents of an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll said they expected their lives to change in only a \u201csmall way\u201d or not at all. The poll found a partisan divide.\n\nAnthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infection disease expert, went on every Sunday news show to say that the public was not taking the social distancing guidance seriously enough. He urged all Americans to isolate themselves from others.\n\n\u201cI think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing,\u201d Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nOn CNN, asked specifically about crowded restaurants and bars, Fauci said he would \u201clike to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see in restaurants and in bars.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever it takes to do that, that's what I would like to see,\u201d he said.\n\nState and local officials last week had already begun imposing significant restrictions on the public, from school closures to limits on large public gathering.\n\nIn Jersey City, New Jersey\u2019s second-largest city and a bedroom community for many New York workers, Mayor Steve Fulop was among the first in the nation to escalate government-led interventions, imposing a 10 p.m. curfew on all bars and restaurants that serve liquor.\n\nFulop said in an interview Sunday he saw the move as one that balanced the health policy interests with a desire not to impose draconian restrictions on the public.\n\n\u201cI think we were aggressive. We were the first ones out there. But we were measured,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were careful not to get sucked into a peer pressure situation because others were doing it.\u201d\n\nStill, he said a patchwork policy isn't good and said the state should help impose uniform restrictions.\n\n\u201cStateside elected officials can drive the conversation in a meaningful way,\u201d Fulop said. \u201cYou have one school district doing this, you have one district doing that.\u201d\n\nThe decision of public officials to take dramatic action may be especially difficult to make with St. Patrick\u2019s Day this week, California-based Democratic strategist Garry South said. Orders to close bars could involve political fallout \u2014 particularly for Democratic officials who manage big cities, South predicted.\n\n\u201cIf you order the closure of restaurants, bars pubs and all the other places where people gather, it\u2019s going to be immensely unpopular with people who frequent them,\u201d as well as with employee put of work, he said. \u201cBut politicians should err on the side of caution, rather than complacency, because when all is said and done, if the virus spreads, they\u2019ll the blame.\u201d\n\nAfter days of resistance to such severe measures restrictions, the dam seemed to break over the weekend \u2014 at both the local and state levels.\n\nIn California, the nation\u2019s most populous state, Democrat Newsom ordered more than five million residents over the age of 65 to isolate at home, directed that wineries, bars, breweries and nightclubs close and mandated that restaurants reduce the number of customers they serve while instituting social distancing measures.\n\n\u201cThis is a nonessential function in our state,\u201d Newsom said of nightlife businesses.\n\nHis move Sunday came shortly after the restrictions imposed in Illinois and Ohio.\n\nIn New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has advocated for social distancing, but until late Sunday resisted calls to close schools and has not imposed restrictions on businesses. On Sunday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo stepped in to force the closure of schools in New York, on Long Island and in other downstate communities, and de Blasio seemed open to restricting access to bars.\n\n\u201cI do want every effort that we can at normalcy, but what we can\u2019t afford anymore is the huge gatherings,\u201d de Blasio said on ABC Sunday morning. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about the bar on the corner of my street in Brooklyn. It\u2019s a wonderful place, but we can\u2019t afford everyone pressed up against each other in the bar.\u201d\n\nNew York City Council Member Steve Levin, however, is advocating for New York City to shut down in a similar manner to France and Spain.\n\nWithout a shutdown, \u201cwe wait around and deny the inevitable,\u201d Levin tweeted. \u201cThat means we shut down amid chaos, overrun hospitals, emergency departments who can\u2019t take any more patients and all the tragedy and suffering that ensues.\u201d\n\nThe federal government may soon have nationwide guidance on business closures, Vice President Mike Pence hinted on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe will have updated guidelines tomorrow morning for you that are being vetted now by CDC and all of our top health care experts,\u201d he said at a White House press conference. \u201cWe will respect and defer to decisions made by governors.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s not much the White House can do to force closures, which would raise federalism issues, said Polly Price, an Emory University law professor who\u2019s an expert in public health law. But, she said, guidance from federal officials could be key in giving local leaders \u2014 who do have the legal right to impose these sort of restrictions \u2014 an opening to do so.\n\n\u201cThe strong direction of the CDC is really helpful here because these are very unpopular decisions \u2014 and brave decisions, as far as I\u2019m concerned \u2014 to close down public gathering,\u201d she said. \u201cTo the extent that they need political cover for doing so, if the CDC is giving them this advice, that could give them legal cover.\u201d\n\nDan Goldberg in New Jersey, Amanda Eisenberg in New York, Shia Kapos in Chicago, Katherine Landergan and Carly Sitrin in Philadelphia, Carla Marinucci and Jeremy B.
