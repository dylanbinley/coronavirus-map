I think he needs my loyalty, competence and support.\n\nReporter: What will be your guiding principle as the chief of staff?\n\nGambari: To serve the President to the best of my ability.\n\nThe new CoS, who hails from Ilorin, Kwara State, had arrived at the villa around 10.53am and was welcomed by the State House Chief of Protocol, Alhaji Yakubu Ahmed; the Permanent Secretary, Mr Tijani Umar, and some senior directors in the Presidency.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria needs a cure for distrust too\n\nGambari was screened on arrival for COVID-19.
