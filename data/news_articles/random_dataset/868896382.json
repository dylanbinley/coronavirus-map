Our fishermen build boats but stay at home instead of going out to fish.\n\n\u201cIf we ask others to fish for us, they sell the catch at sea and do not bring it back to shore,\u201d he told journalists when concluding his three-day official visit to Vietnam.\n\nDr Mahathir said Malaysian waters are rich in marine resources.\n\nPoaching by foreign fishermen, including Vietnamese fishermen, in Malaysian waters was among the issues discussed during his meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc.\n\nDr Mahathir said the Malaysian authorities have taken action against the foreign fishermen who poached in Malaysian waters but this has not fully resolved the issue of poaching because Malaysian fishermen must also play their role.\n\nIt has been reported that 748 Vietnamese fishing boats and 7,203 skippers and crew have been detained for intrusion into Malaysian waters.\n\nDr Mahathir\u2019s visit to Vietnam was at the invitation of the Vietnamese prime minister.\n\nThe last time that Dr Mahathir made a working visit to Vietnam was in 1998, to attend the Asean Summit.\n\nMalaysia and Vietnam established diplomatic relations in 1973. \u2014 Bernama"}}
