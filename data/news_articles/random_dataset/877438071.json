At least one high-profile Norwegian defense attorney objected to how the American was quickly excused.\n\n\u201cThis is just proof that the USA is still the Wild West,\u201d exclaimed attorney Brynjar Meling, after hearing of how the Norwegian was shot when he attempted to surprise his father-in-law with a visit on the elder American man\u2019s birthday.\n\n\u201cIn Norwegian and European legal practice, this case should at least be investigated and not quickly written off as a \u2018tragic accident,'\u201d Meling told state broadcaster NRK, citing the words of the local sheriff for Santa Rosa County near Pensacola, Florida, where the shooting occurred.\n\nThe Norwegian man had flown to Pensacola, where a friend picked him up at the airport and drove him to his father-in-law\u2019s home. The Norwegian had once lived in the area before moving back to Norway with his American wife.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know that his father-in-law had apparently felt threatened by another family member earlier in the evening, which led to what the police called \u201ca confrontation.\u201d When he knocked on the backdoor, and then jumped out from behind some bushes to surprise his father-in-law, the elder man shot him in the chest at close range with a half-automatic pistol. The Norwegian died at the scene.\n\nLocal police quickly ruled that it was all a \u201ctragic accident,\u201d adding that everyone \u201cmust pray for the family,\u201d because it was \u201cdifficult to understand what they must be going through.\u201d The family in Norway has refused all interviews and asked not to be contacted. Norway\u2019s foreign ministry was involved in the case and expected to help arrange sending the Norwegian\u2019s body back to Norway.\n\nnewsinenglish.no staff"}}
