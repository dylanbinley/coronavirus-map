Michael had \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 been having an affair with her, too, in addition to Ophelia.\n\nAnnabelle turned up at Roisin\u2019s house when Michael was out, and the pair got into an argument and tussle \u2013 resulting in the accidental death of Annabelle.\n\nWhile a distraught Roisin shakily told Michael that the death had been an accident, he saw an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone: gain better control over his wife, and protect his reputation as a newly published novelist\u2026\n\nDid Michael steal Annabelle\u2019s book?\n\nMichael convinced the vulnerable Roisin to travel to Ireland with him and fake her own death, using Annabelle\u2019s body in the staged fire.\n\nBut the real reason he wanted to avoid going to the police about Annabelle wasn\u2019t to protect his wife \u2013 it was to protect himself and his fragile ego.\n\nOphelia had discovered Annabelle\u2019s novel manuscript hidden in Michael\u2019s summerhouse \u2013 with his own comments about the book scrawled on the front and addressed to the \u201cpromising\u201d novelist-to-be Annabelle.\n\nHer manuscript was strikingly similar to Michael\u2019s own book, \u2018The House at Knockdara\u2019, which he had recently published to great acclaim \u2013 he\u2019d stolen the idea from her, and was now terrified of being exposed as a fraud and plagiariser.\n\nWho killed Michael?\n\nChannel 5\n\nRoisin snuck back to the House at Knockdara, where she confronted a tied-up Ophelia about her affair with Michael \u2013 only to be told by Ophelia that her philandering husband had gaslighted her for years.\n\nMichael returned to the house, seemingly convincing Roisin that Ophelia was tricking her.\n\nOnce he and Ophelia were alone, he became incensed, realising that she had taken Annabelle\u2019s manuscript and that the truth about his book was going to come to light (she had sneakily left the manuscript at Sean\u2019s place, with instructions to take it to the police).\n\nHowever, as Michael became violent towards the pregnant Ophelia, Roisin reappeared and hit him over the head with a brick \u2013 and he fell through the burnt-out floor to his death.\n\nWhat happened to Roisin and Ophelia?\n\nMary convinced both Roisin and Ophelia to frame the now-dead Michael for Annabelle\u2019s death \u2013 and stage Roisin\u2019s murder, leaving her free to disappear abroad and live her life.\n\nLuckily for both Roisin and Ophelia, Ruth (Roisin\u2019s best friend at Cambridge) had also been conducting her own research, finding one of Annabelle\u2019s earrings outside Michael and Roisin\u2019s house before taking it to the police.\n\nAt the end of the episode we jumped forward one year: Ophelia had had her baby and returned to Cambridge, while Roisin was living under a pseudonym in Marrakesh.\n\nHowever, right at the end of the episode, Annabelle\u2019s bereaved brother Richard \u2013 who had been tailing Michael earlier in the episode, desperate for answers \u2013 tracked her down.\n\nWith a confrontation seemingly about to take place between the pair, the episode ended \u2013 leaving plenty of scope for a potential second season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck out what else is on with our TV Guide."}}
