Impeachment didn\u2019t come up.", "TEXT": "DIXFIELD, Maine \u2014 The impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump enters a new phase this week, raising the political stakes for the president and also for lawmakers such as U.S. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine\u2019s 2nd District.\n\nVoters in Golden\u2019s district overwhelmingly supported the president in 2016, and that has left the freshman Democrat walking a fine line. Golden is trying to show his constituents that impeachment is not crowding out other issues important to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the past two months the impeachment process has dominated the news from the nation\u2019s capital. But at a town hall hosted by Golden at the Swasey-Torrey American Legion Post in Dixfield, the controversy involving the president and Ukraine took a back seat to issues closer to home.\n\nRandy Cantwell, a veteran who was telling Golden about trouble with the phone system at the VA Maine Healthcare System, saying veterans are transferred \u201cout west someplace and you\u2019re on hold for a half-hour, 40 minutes\u201d and getting \u201cfed up.\u201d\n\nGolden, wearing jeans, boots and an untucked chamois shirt, is a Marine veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and expressed familiarity with many of the issues raised at the event, which was part of a tour designed to hit as many small towns as possible in the sprawling 2nd District \u2014 the largest geographically east of the Mississippi.\n\nMonday\u2019s town hall was organized as a veteran-specific forum. But other topics, including impeachment, were fair game, which prompted Dixfield Town Manager Dustin Starbuck to layout the ground rules for discourse.\n\n\u201cI know it won\u2019t be a problem, but everyone be respectful even if someone\u2019s, you know, opinion is disagreeable to you,\u201d Starbuck said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a problem. For about an hour, roughly 20 attendees asked Golden to look into an assortment of issues, but impeachment did not come up. Charles Greene, commander of the Dixfield post, asked about addiction services that have been moved out of Togus.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done away with it. We still got millions of vets out there that need that kind of care. Why did Togus take that away and start spending millions of dollars on signs they don\u2019t need?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe event took a brief detour when a merchant held court to extol the benefits of medical marijuana. Even when given the opportunity at the end of the meeting to discuss impeachment arose, no one broached it. Golden said most of town halls he\u2019s held have gone the same way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that people don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are a lot of other priorities out there, and I think there\u2019s a general sentiment that people want a Congress and government that can work together and deliver.\u201d\n\nGolden acknowledges that working together and delivering are not words typically used to describe Congress these days, a condition stemming from the partisan gridlock that\u2019s gripped the capital for years. But he notes that the Democratic-controlled House has passed hundreds of bills, and that most of them have gone nowhere in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n\n\u201cIf people feel like work isn\u2019t being done or prioritized they should take it up with the Senate at this point,\u201d Golden said.\n\nGridlock is not a new theme in Washington, but for Democrats in swing districts like Golden, who are seeking reelection next year, it has become more complicated because of impeachment. He voted to endorse House Democrats\u2019 framework for the impeachment process in October, but he has stressed that he has not decided whether to endorse impeaching Trump.\n\nThe leading Republicans among the field of four vying for their party\u2019s nomination to face Golden in November 2020 have featured that vote prominently in their campaigns so far. Golden appears to recognize the potential potency of that message in a district that the president carried by 10 points in 2016.\n\n\u201cI actually don\u2019t agree with those who are trying to claim that the impeachment inquiry is crowding out work in Congress,\u201d Golden said.\n\nGolden said he\u2019s troubled by what\u2019s emerged about Trump and that it should be safe for both Republicans and Democrats to agree that a U.S. president should not ask a foreign government to investigate a political rival.\n\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that I am sold on what the best step is in terms of addressing it,\u201d he said.\n\nThis article appears through a media partnership with Maine Public."}}
