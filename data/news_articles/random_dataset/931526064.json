In a lengthy statement, Myka, 32, apologized \u201cfor the uproar\u201d that followed after announcing in a tearful video that they placed four-year-old Huxley, whom they adopted from China in 2017, with another family. Myka said in her statement that she was \u201cnaive\u201d about the adoption process, and \u201cwas not selective or fully equipped or prepared\u201d for Huxley, who was later diagnosed with autism and a sensory processing disorder.\n\n\u201cI take full responsibility for all of the hurt that I have caused. This decision has caused so many people heartbreak and I\u2019m sorry for letting down so many women that looked up to me as a mother,\u201d Myka wrote. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the confusion, and pain I have caused, and I am sorry for not being able to tell more of my story from the beginning. I could have never anticipated the incidents which occurred on a private level to ever have happened, and I was trying my best to navigate the hardest thing I have ever been through.\u201d\n\nMyka, whose popular YouTube channel focuses on parenting and her four biological children, said that she \u201cneeded more training\u201d before bringing Huxley home. The Stauffers were reportedly told before the 2017 adoption that Huxley had a brain cyst and a brain tumor, they explained in a YouTube video, which has now been deleted. They later allegedly later discovered that he had a stroke in utero, and has autism and a sensory processing disorder. Myka claimed in their announcement video that \u201cnumerous medical professionals have felt that he needed a different fit,\u201d so they placed him with a \u201cnew mommy,\u201d who has \u201cprofessional training,\u201d in a \u201cforever home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I wish this never happened because I\u2019m still so glad Huxley is here and getting all of the help he needs,\u201d Myka wrote in her statement one month later. \u201cI also know that even though he is happier in his new home and doing better that he still experienced trauma and I\u2019m sorry, no adoptee deserves any more trauma. I wanted to help so bad I was willing to bring home any child that needed me. For this I was na\u00efve, foolish, and arrogant. I wish so bad I would have been more prepared and done more. I wish the decision to disrupt never had to be made.\u201d\n\nMyka also defended herself and James from critics who accused them of exploiting Huxley and his adoption journey. \u201c\u2026we did not adopt a child to gain wealth. While we did receive a small portion of money from videos featuring Huxley and his journey, every penny and much more went back into his care.\u201d She concluded by writing, \u201cWe love Huxley and know that this was the right decision for him and his future. Praying that Huxley only has the best future in the entire world.\u201d"}}
