Working together, we shall give Nigeria the best that will meet Nigerians aspirations.\n\n\u201cOutside agriculture, the best employer of labour is tourism. But its contribution to our Gross Domestic Product is infinitesimal and it is unacceptable.\n\n\u201cToday, destiny has brought on my shoulder and my colleagues to steer the ship. Our mission is to revive it. The good news there is that all of us must strive to make a mark.\n\n\u201cWe shall work together as members of one family. We aren\u2019t here to police you but to get the job done.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the Director General, National Centre for Arts and Culture, Segun Runsewe said tourism has been neglected by successive administration but said if well harnessed, it could make a lot of difference in revenue earning of the federal government.\n\nOtunba Runsewe also called on the Senate to show more than passing concern in the indiscriminate issuance of Nigerian international passport, however, argued that some of the people being apprehended in a foreign nation for heinous activities were not Nigerians.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria.\n\nKindly Share This Story:"}}
