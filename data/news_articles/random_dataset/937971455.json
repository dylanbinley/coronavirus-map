And when he showed up to work for Congress, he started preparing for the possibility that the House might impeach President Trump.\n\nLess than a year later, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an official impeachment inquiry. Eisen\u2019s new book, A Case for the American People: The United States v. Donald J. Trump describes this moment in time through the House vote to impeach Trump and the Senate trial, which ended in acquittal.\n\nThe book reveals that Eisen had drafted 10 articles of impeachment a month before Pelosi\u2019s announcement. More here from NPR.\n\nWhile we all seem to rely on leaks and alleged leaks for unknown truths or some access to an inside track, perhaps just reading Norm Eisen\u2019s book is a must to understand the real workings in Washington DC.\n\nSure, it will make Republicans and conservatives angry but consider reading it to understand more and for context as well as the opportunity to think more strategically when it comes to politics in DC.\n\n\u201cA Case for the American People,\u201d by Norm Eisen \u2014 an architect of the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment strategy \u2014isn\u2019t shy about its conclusions: Eisen believes in his bones that Trump is a recidivist criminal who must be ousted to save the republic. He also believes the Democrats who engineered Trump\u2019s impeachment are heroes on par with the founders. The book is, at the bottom, an effort to convey those conclusions \u2014 and Eisen\u2019s centrality to the impeachment effort \u2014 to the wider world.\n\nBut Eisen\u2019s 280-page chronicle of the impeachment era, replete with his inside-the-room knowledge of how the process unfolded, juxtaposes lawmakers\u2019 lofty pronouncements about protecting democracy with the often provincial tensions and messy House politics that drove decisions of national significance.\n\nEisen, who signed up as a House Judiciary Committee attorney in early 2019 with an eye toward impeachment, also describes the hail of early \u201cf\u2014 you\u2019s\u201d he delivered to House Intelligence Committee aide Daniel Goldman, who he said had accused him of treading on the panel\u2019s turf. (They would later get past the initial tension, Eisen says). He describes how internal Democratic politics led him to shave a planned 10 articles of impeachment \u2014 encompassing a sweeping range of allegations such as \u201ccollusion\u201d and \u201chush money payments\u201d down to three, and then two after vulnerable Democrats rejected charging Trump with obstruction of justice.\n\nEisen reveals the sometimes painful conflicts between House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) \u2014 in Eisen\u2019s eyes, the unsung hero of impeachment \u2014 and House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who often resisted Nadler\u2019s lead-foot on the impeachment accelerator. Nadler drew Pelosi\u2019s ire throughout the process by leaning into calls for impeachment faster than the rest of the House was ready for, and Eisen said Nadler had accepted that it would take time to restore his \u201cformer level personal warmth\u201d with the speaker.\n\nEisen writes. [Nadler chief of staff Amy Rutkin] and I furiously worked our Rolodexes, as did the entire staff.\u201d\n\nAmong their successes? Eisen writes that he persuaded anti-Trump conservative Bill Kristol to rescind support for a select committee and that Rutkin persuaded progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to retweet Kristol\u2019s reversal, adding her own note of urgency to leave the process with the Judiciary Committee. Eisen \u2014 a former ambassador to the Czech Republic and Obama White House\u2019s ethics czar \u2014 regales readers with his decades-old entanglements with many of the figures involved in Trump\u2019s trial, from Trump\u2019s trial lawyers to even the State Department\u2019s impeachment witnesses, like former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, whom he describes as \u201cmy friend and former colleague.\u201d Read more here from Politico."}}
