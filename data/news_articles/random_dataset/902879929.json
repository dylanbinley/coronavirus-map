And not a word about how unacceptable that premise is.\n\nWhile the NBC affiliate deleted that tweet, its article about the Monsey stabbing and the Jersey City shooting remains online with the subheading, \u201cthe expansion of Hasidic communities in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley, the Catskills and northern New Jersey has led to some anti-semitic rhetoric.\u201d The article, which appears to have originated with the AP, explained about the Jersey City shootings: \u201cThe slayings happened in a neighborhood where Hasidic families had recently been relocating, amid pushback from some local officials who complained about representatives of the community going door to door, offering to buy homes at Brooklyn prices.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, after the Jersey City shooting, a New Jersey local news outlet ran the headline, \u201cTensions within a changing community are heightened in the wake of the Jersey City tragedy,\u201d and the subheading: \u201cthe sentiment had simmered ever since ultra-orthodox Jews began moving to a lower-income section of a city where other areas have seen a boom.\u201d The Northjersey.com article noted that officials and community leaders had condemned a public antisemitic outburst in the wake of the attack. \u201cBut,\u201d the article equivocated [emphasis added], and then quoted one resident, \u201c\u2018People who have been living here for years \u2026 are dealing with being unable to afford it because of the changes that are happening in Jersey City.\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated coverage Netanyahu, Another Election Will Smash What Little Faith We Have Left JNS.org \u2013 Prime Minister Netanyahu, don\u2019t take us there, to a fourth election in under two years. Don\u2019t drag all...\n\nWhile gentrification is hardly unique to Jersey City, we don\u2019t see reporters or opinion writers suggesting that violence against, say, the white hipsters in Williamsburg would be in any way understandable or even possibly expected.\n\nWe have, however, seen this type of victim-blaming before. For years, some in the media have explicitly or implicitly endorsed the idea that Jews should not live in the West Bank.\n\nIn a 2014 column in The Washington Post, for example, Jill Jacobs, the Executive Director of T\u2019ruah, described a group that legally purchased homes in a neighborhood in eastern Jerusalem as \u201cthe worst kind of thief.\u201d In 2016, The New York Times, though temporarily, adopted a policy of describing Jewish towns in Judea and Samaria as being \u201con Palestinian territory\u201d \u2014 appointing itself, somehow, the arbiter of an international border dispute. Columnist Peter Beinart has argued for years that Jews who live in Judea and Samaria should be boycotted, and more recently, he baselessly compared these Jewish neighborhoods to the Jim Crow era in the South.\n\nAnd in 2019, The Forward printed an opinion piece that argued that \u201cPalestinians Are Right to Outlaw Selling Land to Settlers.\u201d\n\nThe implication of all these pieces and others is that those Jews who choose to live in certain places where they are the minority, do so at their own risk \u2014 and their children\u2019s. We see this play out in reporting of and discussions about terrorism. For example, in 2016, Reuters reported the death of 13-year-old Hallel Yaffa Ariel with the headline, \u201cPalestinian kills teen in Israeli settlement, then shot dead.\u201d Editors found that the fact that she was \u201cin [an] Israeli settlement\u201d was of such importance to the story that it merited mention in both the headline and in the very first sentence, which read: \u201cA Palestinian fatally stabbed a 13-year-old Israeli girl in her bedroom in a settlement in the occupied West Bank \u2026.\u201d Ariel lived in Kiryat Arba, a suburb of Hebron. Hebron is the location of the Cave of the Patriarchs, where the forefathers and foremothers of the Jewish religion are said to be buried.\n\nIn 2018, the Canadian National Post reported on the death of Ari Fuld with the headline, \u201cU.S.-born Israeli settler killed in West Bank stabbing hailed as a hero by Netanyahu.\u201d This, despite the fact that the article as originally printed in The Washington Post referred to Fuld in the headline as a \u201cU.S.-born Israeli citizen.\u201d Both news outlets, however, said in the third paragraph, that \u201che was stabbed to death Sunday outside a supermarket at a busy intersection in the Israeli-occupied West Bank that in recent years has become synonymous with such deadly attacks.\u201d The article also reported, \u201ccritics of Israel debated [his death] on social media, notably his choice to live in the settlement area known to Israelis as Gush Etzion. Some agreed with a critic who tweeted, \u2018An armed settler is a fair target.\u2019\u201d The Washington Post even included the tweet.\n\nIs it possible that the insinuation that it\u2019s the Jews\u2019 own fault if they are shot, stabbed, and otherwise assaulted, because of where they live in Israel, has now affected the conversation in America? I\u2019ll let you decide."}}
