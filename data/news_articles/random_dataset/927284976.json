The officers reacted to a perceived threat,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI would say that it\u2019s always a tragedy anytime an officer has to use force. My condolences to his family; it is a difficult thing to happen I understand that.\u201d\n\nWilliams said police saw about a dozen people suspected of stealing in the parking lot of the store. One of the cars rammed into a police vehicle and prompted a wild chase, he said. At the same time, officers spotted Monterrosa near the building, with what appeared to be a weapon, he said.\n\n\u201cThis individual appeared to be running toward the black sedan when suddenly he stopped, taking a kneeling position, and placing his hands above his waist, revealing what appeared to be the butt of a handgun,\u201d Williams said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn officer fired five times through a police car windshield, hitting Monterrosa once, Williams said. Monterrosa had a 15-inch hammer tucked into the pocket of his sweatshirt, the chief said.\n\nJohn Burris, an attorney for the family, said he is appalled police would shoot at a person who was on his knees with his hands raised.\n\n\u201cThis young man was shot multiple times while he was on his knees and appeared to be trying to surrender,\u201d Burris said, adding that he understands tensions have been high. \u201cBut one has to maintain control and you don\u2019t get to arbitrarily shoot someone in a panic, just because the situation is excitable.\u201d.\n\nThe officer who shot Monterrosa is an 18-year veteran who has been placed on leave pending an investigation."}}
