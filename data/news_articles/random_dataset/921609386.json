The region helped pioneer massive cash transfer programs for low-income families over the past three decades, with notable success in Brazil, Mexico and elsewhere. But the pandemic has instead exposed existing vulnerabilities in Latin America\u2019s social safety net. If policymakers aren\u2019t careful, it could create new ones as well.\n\n\u201cThe widespread use of cash transfers during the pandemic sheds light on longstanding challenges,\u201d Ugo Gentilini, a senior World Bank economist focused on social protection, told AQ. \u201cBut it also provides an opportunity to innovate.\u201d\n\nSince the start of the crisis, several countries have rushed to expand existing cash transfer programs. Brazil\u2019s government added one million families to Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, for example, and is using its database of poor households, the cadastro \u00fanico, to identify more potential beneficiaries. In Argentina, families already enrolled in the Universal Child Allowance subsidy program will receive an extra 3,100 pesos (about $48) per child, double the normal transfer. Colombia\u2019s government has expanded and accelerated the start of a pilot cash transfer program, while Mexico\u2019s President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has increased funding for several existing social programs, after scrapping the country\u2019s CCT program early in his presidency.\n\nOther countries have created emergency cash transfers specifically in response to COVID-19. Chile introduced a 50,000 pesos ($58) subsidy for 2 million people without formal jobs in March, to run alongside existing subsidy programs. The governments of Peru and El Salvador are similarly launching new programs to reach vulnerable households with direct cash payments.\n\nSuch emergency responses, however, underscore huge logistical challenges. In El Salvador, crowds outside offices where subsidies were being distributed prompted the government to close them, sparking protests. In Peru, many families lack bank accounts and internet access, limiting access in rural areas. And even despite social distancing guidelines, many beneficaries have no choice but to pick up subsidy payments in person. Governments\u2019 inability to Identify vulnerable recipients has also caused setbacks. Peru\u2019s President Mart\u00edn Vizcarra admitted to errors of omission, in part because some municipalities have not updated the figures on vulnerable households that were prepared by the national statistics institution several years ago.\n\n\u201cThe crisis highlights the fragility of our safety nets,\u201d Luis Miguel Castilla, the former finance minister of Peru, said during a web conference hosted by the Wilson Center on April 15. \u201cPeru lacks the tools to reach vulnerable populations.\u201d\n\nAmong those who have been hardest to reach are informal workers, who make up over half of all workers in Latin America, according to the International Labor Organization. Countries are scrambling to implement emergency measures to assist this vulnerable sector, but many are falling through the cracks. In Argentina, the government started offering a lump sum payment of 10,000 pesos ($155) to 3.6 million families made up of informal and domestic workers. Colombia\u2019s Solidarity Income program, a one-off payment of 160,000 pesos ($108) for three million informal workers and their families, uses an existing database of subsidy recipients and tax information to identify potential beneficiaries.\n\nMigrants, many of whom are not eligible for social programs in their host countries, are also especially vulnerable. In Peru, for example, where over 860,000 Venezuelans have moved since 2015, support for migrants is incomplete. According to ongoing research conducted by the CIUP, a research center at Lima\u2019s Universidad del Pac\u00edfico, 95% of Venezuelans in Peru surveyed said they don\u2019t receive institutional support from the government or international organizations. The number of Venezuelans with irregular status could increase as a result of the border closings and other measures implemented in the region\u2019s effort to curb the coronavirus\u2019 spread.\n\n\u201cSocial protection and migrants should not be a side issue in the conversation,\u201d Monica Rubio, senior adviser for social policy at UNICEF\u2019s Latin America office, told AQ. \u201cIt\u2019s something that should be on the international community\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nEmergency situations like COVID-19 make it evident that countries need broader programs and wider safety nets. Rubio said she sees the current crisis also as \u201can opportunity to rethink social protection in Latin America.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore people are convinced now than before COVID-19, that expansions to social protection programs are necessary,\u201d she said.\n\nThe good news is that policymakers in the region don\u2019t have to look far for models on how to expand these programs. Some programs in the Southern Cone, for example, \u201ctend toward universal coverage\u201d Gerardo Escaroz of UNICEF, told AQ, crediting the region\u2019s higher levels of formal employment. For example, Argentina\u2019s Universal Child Allowance provides child grants to vulnerable children not yet covered by other systems.\n\nFor now, the pandemic\u2019s toll on workers and health care systems is leaving many Latin American governments with little choice but to spend now and worry about fiscal restraints later. In the long term, Rubio is convinced that the vulnerabilities exposed by the pandemic will leave policymakers little choice but to go further, and move toward some form of universal basic income.\n\n\u201cThe debate about universality is going to happen,\u201d Rubio told AQ. \u201cIt has to happen.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nRauls is an editorial intern at AQ\n\nAny opinions expressed in this piece do not necessarily reflect those of Americas Quarterly or its publishers."}}
