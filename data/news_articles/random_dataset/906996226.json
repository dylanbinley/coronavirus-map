As we have said in past operations, we can suddenly show up overnight.\n\n\"To be clearer, the Idlib operation is a matter of timing.\"\n\n'If we don\u2019t hold this line, tomorrow 3.5 million people will be left at the regime\u2019s mercy' - Ibrahim Kalin, Erdogan\u2019s spokesperson\n\nTurkey has been deploying more elite troops, howitzers, armoured vehicles and tanks to Idlib over the past three weeks.\n\nSeveral officials in Ankara told Middle East Eye that the current build-up some six kilometres outside Idlib city was unprecedented in any past Turkish operations in Syria.\n\nReacting to Erdogan's statement, a senior Russian official said a Turkish military operation against the Syrian army would be \"the worst case scenario\".\n\n\"If we are talking about an operation against the legitimate authorities of the Syrian republic and armed forces of the Syrian republic, this would of course be the worst scenario,\" said Russian presidential spokesperson Dimitry Peskov.\n\nA Turkish delegation led by Deputy Foreign Minister Sedat Onal met Russian officials in Moscow on Monday and Tuesday. Russia has been a stalwart ally of Assad throughout the nearly nine-year war.\n\nIbrahim Kalin, Erdogan\u2019s spokesperson, told journalists that the negotiations didn\u2019t bear fruit and Turkey refused a new Russian proposal for the fate of Idlib, including a new map.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t change the locations of military observation stations and we will continue to send reinforcements to Idlib,\u201d Kalin said on Tuesday night. \u201cIf we don\u2019t hold this line, tomorrow 3.5 million people will be left at the [Assad] regime\u2019s mercy.\u201d\n\nA Turkish official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told MEE that the Russians had proposed that new borders be drawn north of the strategic M4 and M5 highways.\n\nA separate Turkish source said the proposal would leave 60 percent of the Idlib province under Assad control and require the relocation of Turkish military stations to the new demarcation line, while joint Turkish-Russian patrols would be maintained on the highways.\n\nDifferences 'too big'\n\nErdogan said that negotiations with Russia would continue, but that the differences between the two countries were too big to be bridged.\n\nTurkish sources expect that a third round of negotiations will continue in Ankara next week, as the deadline looms for an Erdogan ultimatum calling on pro-government forces to withdraw from recently seized territories by the end of February.\n\nA UN assessment has estimated that a Syrian government offensive backed by Russia and Iran has displaced nearly 1 million people in Idlib, the last rebel-held Syrian enclave, since December.\n\nOn Wednesday, Erdogan called on the Syrian army to withdraw from areas it captured beyond the so-called Sochi line.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t leave Idlib to the regime and its backers, who don\u2019t understand our decisiveness on this issue,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cWhatever the cost, we are adamant about transforming Idlib into a secure area for the region\u2019s people and Turkey.\u201d"}}
