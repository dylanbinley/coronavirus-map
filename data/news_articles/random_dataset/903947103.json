It is more than training. They want more concrete action,\u201d said city councillor Abdelhaq Sari, the public security critic for the Ensemble Montr\u00e9al party, at a press conference at city hall. The opposition will table a motion at the next council meeting asking the city to phase in body cams for police officers starting in January 2021. In November, Montreal city council unanimously adopted a motion calling for an immediate stop to unjustified street checks by police. It followed a city-commissioned report last month that shows Montreal police stop black, Indigenous and Arab people far more often than white people.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.

Premier Jason Kenney made the announcement during a visit to Montreal as part of a one-week trip to Quebec and Washington D.C. to promote investments and pipelines. The new office will be run by a former Quebecer who has spent several years in Alberta. It is slated to open this spring. The news was tempered, however, by the suggestion that pipeline-wary Quebecers should be more appreciative of the resource-rich hand that has long fed them. \u201cQuebecers and Albertans can and should be partners in prosperity,\u201d Kenney said in an interview with the Montreal Gazette\u2019s editorial board.\n\nTwo men were arrested after being caught with a package accurately labeled \u201cBag Full of Drugs.\u201d Officers found the bags after making a traffic stop, according to a Facebook post by the Santa Rosa County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Reports indicate the bags contained methamphetamine, cocaine, fentanyl and GHB. \u201cDo not traffic your illegal narcotics in bags labeled \u2018Bag Full Of Drugs\u2019,\u201d the Sherriff\u2019s Office wrote. Just not trafficking drugs also works, one imagines."}}
