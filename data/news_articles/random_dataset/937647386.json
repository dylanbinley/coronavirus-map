By May 20, restrictions had begun to lift in all states. But just a month later, Texas and Florida reversed course on their reopenings as COVID-19 cases skyrocketed. July 19 represented the fifth consecutive day that Florida reported more than 10,000 new COVID-19 cases daily. Amid these bleak numbers, many businesses and governing bodies across the U.S. are reconsidering rules for safe reopening.\n\nAt the center of this controversy is a debate over whether to mandate face coverings. The CDC recommends the use of face masks or cloth coverings in public places in order to help slow the spread of COVID-19; and a Texas A&M University study released June 12 found that not wearing a face mask dramatically increased the odds of spreading COVID-19. Despite these findings, a nationwide decision has not been made and rule-setting has been left up to individual states, counties, or cities.\n\nAs states progress through reopening phases, many have instituted mandatory face mask requirements. Do you know the face mask rules in your state?"}}
