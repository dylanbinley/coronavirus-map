Sonny Legget, U.S. Forces-Afghanistan.\n\nAngry residents of the area where the strike occurred carried 12 of the bodies to the provincial capital Jalalabad Thursday protesting the attack, said provincial council head Ahmad Ali Hazrat. Many more people are believed to be missing.\n\nAccording to Zaman the local residents had provided prior notice to the local authorities that they would be collecting dried fruit. As many as 50 people were in the fields when the aerial attack occurred, he said.\n\nIn another development Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says Washington is taking back $100 million intended for an Afghan energy infrastructure project, citing unacceptably high levels of corruption in the Afghan government.\n\nPompeo said the U.S. will still finish the massive project that involves five power substations and a maze of transmission lines in southern Afghanistan. It just won\u2019t be spending the money through Afghan President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s government, blaming the \u201cAfghan government\u2019s inability to transparently manage U.S. Government resources.\u201d\n\nTameem Akhgar and Kathy Gannon are Associated Press writers."}}
