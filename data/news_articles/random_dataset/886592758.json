This after they discovered a man\u2019s body in a home freezer. Authorities issued an arrest warrant for 67-year-old Barbara Watters. Authorities were responding to a tip when they found a man\u2019s body in a freezer at 2602 South Vermont Avenue. They have not yet released the man\u2019s identity. An autopsy is planned.\n\nMcDonald County, Mo \u2013 Two people die in a wreck in McDonald County. Police report that one of the fatalities was a six-year-old boy. It happened yesterday just after 6:00 P.M. on U.S. 71 south of Pinevill, Missouri. Authorities say 24-year-old Amun Omer, 19-year-old Nimo Omer, and a 6-year-old boy, all from Noel, Missouri, were heading south when the vehicle attempted to make a U-turn. Both Nimo Omer and the 6-year-old were pronounced dead on the scene.\n\nSeneca, Mo \u2013 Two people accused of beating a man in Seneca to death with a bat have once again received amended charges. Kathy Kay and Clarence Anderson were originally charged with Second-Degree Murder and Armed Criminal Action. Prosecutors had dropped the Second-Degree Murder charge. That was because they didn\u2019t think they could get the witnesses to testify. Now, the witnesses have agreed to testify, so the Second Degree Murder Charge is back.\n\nJoplin, Mo \u2013 Joplin Police Chief Matt Stewart announces he\u2019s retiring in January. His last day with the force is January 3rd, which also marks his 20th anniversary with the department. Over the past 20 years, Chief Stewart says he\u2019s had many proud moments, some moments of fear, all while seeing countless improvements in technology.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2020 BY KOAM.
