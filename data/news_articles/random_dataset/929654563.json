I met a lot of really good people,\u201d he said of both protesters and police.\n\nThe line between peaceful protesters and looters was blurry at first, making his job harder, he said.\n\n\u201cOnce that line was there it made our job a lot easier \u2026 the protesters, the police and the National Guard were all on the same page,\u201d Davidsmeyer said. \u201cThe line was the protesters versus the looters.\u201d\n\nThe Guard\u2019s job while in Chicago was not to detain or arrest people but to help others in the safest manner possible.\n\n\u201cWe have no arresting authority; our job is the preservation of life and then the protection of assets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police were just fantastic, but they were very stressed,\u201d he said.\n\nWith 2020 being such an eventful year so far, being in a foreign country during it all was an interesting experience, especially when coming home, Davidsmeyer said.\n\n\u201cWe came back to the whole COVID thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we left, it was normal here. Then we came back to people wearing masks.\u201d\n\nReturning April 17, Davidsmeyer and his fellow Guardsmen were sent to Texas for quarantine.\n\n\u201cWe spent two weeks in tents for quarantine, but I worked out like crazy because I want to go into the Special Forces,\u201d he said, adding that the quarantine \u201cwas 100% the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nDavidsmeyer first joined the National Guard in Minnesota in 2010 because they had an infantry.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do it because it was the hardest thing,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter transferring to the Illinois Army National Guard two years ago, Davidsmeyer now is ready to take the next step in his military career.\n\nSometime in July Davidsmeyer will be leaving the Guard and joining the U.S. Army to pursue his career with the Special Forces. While he was deployed to Afghanistan, he met and was guided by some current Special Forces members, he said.\n\n\u201cI think what they do is the most good,\u201d he said. \u201cFor all sides.\u201d\n\nDavidsmeyer is prepared to go through the rigorous training, which could take 18 months to complete. He feels it\u2019s worth it.\n\n\u201cIt will be a long, lengthy process and it will be physically challenging,\u201d he said.\n\nDavidsmeyer is proud of his service, but he\u2019s equally passionate about something else \u2014 teaching and the people who do it.\n\n\u201cI am honored (when people thank him for his service), but teachers are not thanked enough and not just military teachers but all teachers,\u201d he said."}}
