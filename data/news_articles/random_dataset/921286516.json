Sign up here.\n\nAs some states took steps to begin phase 1 of their reopening plans this week, others extended their lockdowns again. Fed up with life under tight restriction, Americans demonstrated across the country Friday.\n\nIllinois began another month under a statewide stay-at-home order Friday, though hospitals were allowed to resume non-life-threatening surgeries and retail could open for pickup.\n\nA group of protesters gathered in Chicago\u2019s loop Friday to call on Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, to come up with a plan to reopen the state\u2019s economy.\n\nSeveral hundred gathered outside the Thompson Center, while counter-protesters drove by in their cars calling for the state to remain shut down.\n\nHundreds of protesters also gathered at the state\u2019s Capitol in Springfield calling for Illinois to reopen. The protesters wielded signs that read \u201cFreedom over fear,\u201d \u201cFire Pritzker\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn how you do it in Chicago.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in Charlotte, N.C., dozens of protesters in cars and on foot protested coronavirus restrictions. Some donning signs that said, \u201cMy body, my decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are aware of the seriousness of it, but it should be my choice\u201d what to risk, protester Michelle Reese told the Charlotte Observer. \"I believe it\u2019s my body and my choice, but that should apply to everybody\u2019s body and everybody\u2019s choice.\u201d\n\nDays before at a larger protest in Raleigh hundreds gathered to speak out against Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s extension of the stay-at-home order until May 8.\n\nProtests planned in 11 cities across California. At least 500 trucks, cars, motorcycles circled the state\u2019s capitol in Sacramento at noon on Friday, honking horns and waving flags. At least another 400 people were gathered together on the steps and lawn, in direct defiance of Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s stay-at-home order and California Highway Patrol\u2019s ban on protests on state properties.\n\nNewsom has not yet given an expiration date for the order.\n\nOne day after the governor closed Orange County beaches, more than a thousand protesters gathered near Huntington Beach holding signs with messages like \u201cAll jobs are essential\u201d and \u201cFreedom we the people,\u201d along with criticism of the governor and media outlets.\n\nProtesters also gathered in Los Angeles, San Diego, Venture and San Francisco on Friday.\n\nHundreds gathered in both Dover and Wilmington, Del., several of whom had guns slung across their backs.\n\n\"Where are the legislators?\" protester Chris Rowe shouted to the crowd in the state\u2019s Capitol, who shouted back, \"They're getting paid!\" according to Delaware Online.\n\nLawmakers were originally scheduled to draft and vote on bills until June 30, but the session is postponed indefinitely due to the pandemic. Delaware's shelter-in-place order expires May 15.\n\nThousands have said they will attend protests in Oregon, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Louisiana and Wisconsin over the weekend.\n\nHundreds of protesters angrily swarmed Michigan's Capitol on Thursday -- some armed with rifles -- and even tried to make their way into the state House chamber.\n\n\"Yeah, there's a virus, but it's more of a politician problem that it's gotten this far. There's no reason for us to be locked down. She's trashing our state,\" Rugg told Michigan Radio, referring to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has some of the most severe lockdown measures in the country and recently extended the stay-at-home order until May 28.\n\nTrump called on Whitmer to \"make a deal\" with protesters.\n\n\"The Governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire. These are very good people, but they are angry,\" Trump tweeted. \"They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal.\""}}
