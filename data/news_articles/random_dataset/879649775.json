Mnuchin announced that the president spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and that the sanctions had been imposed.\n\n\u201cThe United States will aggressively use economic sanctions to target those who enable, facilitate and finance these heinous acts in Syria,\u201d Trump said in the statement released on his Twitter feed. \u201cI am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path.\u201d\n\nPence also told reporters that U.S. officials would be travelling to Ankara soon in an attempt to find a solution to one of the most serious \u2014and self-inflicted \u2014foreign policy crises this administration has faced. The withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Syrian border at Erdogan\u2019s request led almost immediately to a Turkish invasion and heavy Kurdish casualties, prompting a broad and bipartisan outcry in Washington.\n\nLawmakers, concerned about emboldening ISIS and the betrayal of Kurdish fighters, are working together on a resolution condemning Trump\u2019s decision and legislation to impose sanctions against Turkey.\n\nTrump, whose global business interests have included office towers in Istanbul, also announced in his statement the reimposition of 50 per cent steel tariffs, which Trump had dropped to 25 per cent earlier this year. The new tariffs were unlikely to cause damage to Turkey\u2019s steel industry, where U.S. purchases account for only about 5 per cent of the country\u2019s steel exports.\n\nDemocrats criticized the president\u2019s actions as inadequate.\n\n\u201cStrong sanctions, while good and justified, will not be sufficient in undoing that damage nor will it stop the consequences stemming from the ISIS jailbreak,\u201d Sens. Charles E. Schumer of New York, Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Jack Reed of Rhode Island said in a statement. \u201cThe first step when Congress returns to session this week is for Republicans to join with us in passing a resolution making clear that both parties are demanding the president\u2019s decision be reversed.\u201d\n\nSecretary of Defense Mark Esper said Monday that Turkey\u2019s invasion had \u201cresulted in the release of many dangerous ISIS detainees, along with \u201cwidespread casualties, refugees, destruction, insecurity, and a growing threat to U.S. military forces.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who rarely publicly breaks with the president, harshly criticized the fallout of Trump\u2019s decision to pull back U.S. troops in Syria.\n\n\u201cWithdrawing U.S. forces from Syria would recreate the very conditions that we have worked hard to destroy and invite the resurgence of ISIS,\u201d he said, adding that it would create a power vacuum readily exploited by Iran and Russia.\n\nTrump stood by his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, which has enabled Turkey\u2019s onslaught. He said that the roughly 1,000 troops leaving Syria will \u201credeploy and remain in the region\u201d to prevent the Islamic State, or ISIS, from regaining strength in a military vacuum.\n\nTrump\u2019s statement came moments after two other tweets in which he asserted that it wasn\u2019t the U.S. responsibility to protect the Syrian border. \u201cAnyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China or Napoleon Bonaparte,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cI hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d\n\nEsper said the Pentagon was \u201cexecuting a deliberate withdrawal of U.S. military personnel from northeast Syria,\u201d saying the roughly 1,000 troops there were \u201cat risk of being engulfed in a broader conflict.\u201d\n\nEsper said Erdogan was responsible for \u201ca potential ISIS resurgence, possible war crimes and a growing humanitarian crisis.\u201d\n\nU.S. troops will move into Iraq in coming days, some leaving by road and others by airlift, a senior U.S. official said. A small contingent of U.S special forces troops will remain in Syria, further south near the town of Tanf, the official added.\n\nEsper said he would travel to NATO headquarters in Brussels next week to press allies to take \u201cdiplomatic and economic measures in response to these egregious Turkish actions.\u201d\n\nLoading...

Lindsey Graham, R-S. C., one of Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill, said they would work together on the joint resolution, Pelosi said in a tweet. \u201cNext, we must put together the strongest bipartisan, bicameral sanctions package\u201d against Turkey.\n\nRead more about:"}}
