In addition to the loss of human life which sometimes occur, these events damage growth prospects and worsen countries\u2019 fiscal positions.\n\n\u201cWith images of the recent destruction of Abaco and Grand Bahama fresh in our minds, there is an urgent need for action from regional and international governments to address this issue, and find solutions to enable countries to rebuild through affordable insurance.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister has fervently championed the staging of an Insurance Colloquium, especially after seeing the devastation in The Bahamas, following the passage of category five Hurricane Dorian two months ago.\n\nsharon.austingill-moore@barbados.gov.bb"}}
