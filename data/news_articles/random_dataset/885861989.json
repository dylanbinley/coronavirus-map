Organiser Dr Sinead Donnelly, a Wellington-based Palliative Medicine specialist, says she is humbled by the response. \u201cWe started with a very simple one-page website and it has just snowballed, which highlights the significant concerns of doctors with this bill.\u201d The Open Letter states that \u2018Doctors want no part in assisted suicide\u2019, noting the World Medical Association and the New Zealand Medical Association positions that \u201cphysician assisted suicide and euthanasia are unethical, even if they were made legal.\u201d The World Medical Association representing physicians in 123 countries last month re-affirmed that euthanasia is not part of medical practice.

LifeNews.com Dr Donnelly says that David Seymour\u2019s End of Life Choice Bill \u201conly includes doctors to provide a cloak of medical legitimacy. \u201cKilling is not caring. It does not require any medical skills, it just requires the abandonment of medical ethics.\u201d She has a simple message to Members of Parliament as they approach the Bill\u2019s 3rd and final Reading next week:\n\n\u201cIf you are really determined to legalise euthanasia, find another profession to do it. Please leave doctors out of it so that we can focus on caring for our patients.\u201d Doctors Say No will present this letter to MP\u2019s this week and will be represented at the people\u2019s gathering outside Parliament midday on Wednesday, November 13th in advance of the final reading of the bill.
