The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce closed its branch in Langton in 2015 and now BMO Bank of Montreal is following suit.\n\nThe pending closure of BMO in Delhi will leave the town with two banks \u2014 the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and TD-Canada Trust.\n\nJim Norman, president of the Delhi and District Chamber of Commerce, is disappointed with the news. BMO\u2019s pending departure and other challenges will be on the agenda of the chamber\u2019s regularly-scheduled monthly meeting Thursday at the Delhi German Home.\n\n\u201cThe chamber is very concerned,\u201d Norman said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had Tony Kleiner Jewellers close, we\u2019ve had the Little Belgian close down, and we\u2019ve heard that other businesses are thinking of closing.\n\n\u201cOur concern is how do we turn things around? We\u2019re thinking it will require a community effort. We\u2019re going to have to do this pretty much on our own.\u201d\n\nAlso disappointed is Delhi Coun. Mike Columbus.\n\n\u201cSuch a closure of a solid anchor service downtown is devastating to a community like Delhi,\u201d Columbus said. \u201cIt is the result of e-commerce banking and big business corporate boardroom decisions.\n\n\u201cIt certainly will be difficult to replace a business like BMO that has served Delhi so well for decades.\u201d\n\nOther towns in Norfolk that have taken a hit on the banking front in recent years include Waterford and Port Rowan. The Bank of Montreal on Alice Street closed several years ago after many decades in Waterford.\n\nFor its part, CIBC closed its branch in Port Rowan last summer, leaving the lakeside community without a bricks-and-mortar financial institution.\n\nBMO\u2019s customers in Langton have been re-assigned to the BMO branch at 160 Broadway St. in Tillsonburg. BMO customers in Delhi have been re-routed to the BMO branch in Simcoe at 23 Norfolk St. S.\n\n\u201cAt both locations, customers will receive an expanded suite of services, including personal, business banking and investment services to accommodate customer wants and needs.\n\n\u201cWhile accounts will be moved to specific branches, customers are welcome and able to conduct their day-to-day banking at any BMO branch or ATM.\u201d\n\nLangton-area Coun. Roger Geysens did not respond to an email request for comment.\n\nMSonnenberg@postmedia.com"}}
