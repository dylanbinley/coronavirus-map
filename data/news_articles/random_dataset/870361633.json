The latest extension came after the main opposition group threatened to boycott formation of a unity government on May 12.\n\nLast week, the body monitoring South Sudan\u2019s ceasefire (CTSAMVM) expressed strong fears over the slow progress in the implementation of the security arrangements in the September 2018 peace accord.\n\nThe CTSAMVM is mandated by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) to monitor and verify the implementation of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities as per the peace deal.\n\nSouth Sudan descended into civil war in late 2013 when President Kiir accused his former deputy Machar of attempting a coup.\n\n(ST)"}}
