Andrew Cuomo said Monday that hospitals, local governments and schools may face a 20% cut in state aid without more help from the federal government.\n\nIn the case of education, Cuomo has four windows to assess state revenue and perhaps take back some money from this year\u2019s budget.\n\nCitizen Action of New York\u2019s Stevie Vargas said that schools can\u2019t handle any more cuts\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford any type of cut, not 50, not 40, not 30, not 5,\u201d said Vargas.\u201cThey have a constitutional obligation to fulfil the needs of students, and they have not done that. Our state has not prioritized education in any way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nVargas said state leaders made their priorities clear when they opted to keep foundation aid flat for this coming school year. In recent weeks, Cuomo said the state has lost more than $10 billion in revenues due to the pandemic, and the cuts had to come from somewhere.\n\nRochester City School District Superintendent Terry Dade said flat foundation aid was a key reason why the district\u2019s deficit grew by more than a third to roughly $87 million. Dade proposed closing five schools, numerous programs, and laying off more than 340 people to close the gap.\n\nBoard of Education President Van White warned that any further aid reduction would be painful for Rochester.\n\n\u201cThe reality is it takes resources when you\u2019re the third-most impoverished district in the nation,\u201d said White. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have those resources, given past history, there are and will be consequences.\u201d\n\nHe also said he sees irony in the relationship between the state and federal governments.\n\n\u201cThe federal government won\u2019t give him the resources to execute the federal government\u2019s important agenda,\" said White. \u201cWell, who does that sound like? That sounds like me, that sounds like Terry Dade, that sounds like my six colleagues on the Board of Education.\u201d\n\nWhite said if the district receives less state aid, the reductions would have to get deeper, putting its goals to increase graduation rates and proficiencies in jeopardy because of a lack of resources."}}
