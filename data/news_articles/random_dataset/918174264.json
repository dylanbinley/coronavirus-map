The blue bike hub, at 169th Street and Fort Washington Avenue, comes ahead of the system\u2019s long-awaited expansion to upper Manhattan\u2014north of 130th Street\u2014and is intended to make it easier for uptown healthcare workers to commute while practicing social distancing.\n\n\u201cOne of our top priorities during this emergency should be the safe movement of our essential personnel, including members of our frontline healthcare workforce,\u201d said City Council member Carlina Rivera, Chair of the Committee on Hospitals, in a statement. \u201cThis Citi Bike station at Columbia Presbyterian, requested by many among the hospital\u2019s staff, is an important signal to them that New York City is listening.\u201d\n\nIn March, Citi Bike and Mayor Bill de Blasio launched the Critical Workforce Membership Program, which provides first-responder, healthcare, and transit workers with free Citi Bike memberships. Transportation advocates say the measures are an important step in strengthening the bike share network.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see Lyft and the City working quickly to expand transportation options to hospital workers who need alternatives to crowded trains and buses,\u201d Transportation Alternatives spokesperson and Washington Heights resident Joe Cutrufo said in a statement. \u201cCiti Bike has stepped up in a big way here, and we hope it\u2019s not long before more stations\u2014and more protected bike lanes \u2014 are rolled out in Northern Manhattan and in the Bronx.\u201d\n\nAdditional stations will roll out in Washington Heights as the blue bike network expands in the area later this year. Last fall, Citi Bike added 85 new docks throughout Bushwick and Ridgewood; later this year the company will begin expanding into upper Manhattan and across a handful of south Bronx neighborhoods.\n\nThe system\u2019s expansion comes as part of a $100 million commitment by Lyft to double the program\u2019s geographic reach and triple the size of its fleet from some 13,000 to 40,000 bikes by 2023."}}
