Macron whisked the US president away for an impromptu meal for two on an oceanfront terrace at the Hotel du Palais. Trump initially appeared frosty but later called it \u201cthe best meeting we have yet had\u201d.\n\n\n\nSenior administration officials quoted by an American newspaper among others were not so sure, complaining the summit had moved from core issues such as global economics and trade to \u201cniche issues\u201d such as climate change, gender equality and development in Africa. The topics were chosen to appeal to Macron supporters, and even to embarrass Trump, who pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord, they said, as protesters marched the streets of the French city calling for action to tackle the fires ravaging the Amazon rainforest.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our view that with France trying to drive these other issues outside of global economics, national security and trade, they\u2019re trying to fracture the G7,\u201d one official told a White House journalist.\n\n\n\nDays earlier, Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House\u2019s national economic council, criticised Macron\u2019s decision to ditch the usual consensus communique at the end of the summit in favour of \u201ccoalitions\u2019 of like-minded states. \u201cThese coalitions produce politically correct bromides such as calls to ban everything from straws to fossil fuels,\u201d he said in an opinion piece published in an American journal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome US officials went further in their diaries, saying French officials had been difficult to work with in the build-up to the summit, and that the original schedule had said little or nothing about trade and the global economy until the US complained, a claim French officials deny.\n\n\n\nAmerica\u2019s differing stance on the climate crisis has been a feature of the past two G7 summits, and just one issue on which divisions were so deep that the meeting was increasingly referred to as the G6 in Quebec last year, when Trump left early.\n\n"}}
