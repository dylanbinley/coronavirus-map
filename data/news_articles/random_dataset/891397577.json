A few minutes later, the driver picked up a second passenger, Cristiano Moura.\n\nAccording to Yvette, Moura \u201cviolently demanded\u201d that she turned down the volume on her phone after a brief noise was emitted as she scrolled through Instagram.\n\nAfter Yvette told Moura that it \u201cwas not a big deal,\u201d she said he grabbed her phone from her hands and referred to her as one of \u201cthose ignorant undeducated black bitches.\u201d\n\nThen, according to Yvette, Moura allegedly began to punch Yvette in the face, head and body, and bit her hand causing her to bleed.\n\nMoura was arrested Thursday night, and was given a desk appearance ticket for assault, according to the NYPD. Moura is scheduled to return to court on Dec. 23.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still trying to understand everything,\u201d said Yvette, who said that since the attack, she has had several panic attacks.\n\nWhen officers arrived on the scene where the Lyft driver had pulled over, at 7th Avenue and West 55th Street, Yvette alleged that she was not given an opportunity to offer an official statement on what happened.\n\n\u201cThey simply spoke to the perpetrator and then gave her two options: to get into a Yellow Cab go home, or go to jail,\u201d said Tahanie Aboushi, from the Aboushi Law Firm, Yvette\u2019s attorney.\n\nAboushi added part of the blame should be placed on Lyft.\n\n\u201cThe Lyft driver should have pulled over much sooner\u2026 and should have intervened,\u201d said Aboushi. A Lyft spokesperson said that the \u201cbehavior described\u201d is not tolerated on Lyft and that ride sharing app is \u201cready to assist law enforcement with their investigation.\u201d\n\nBut Moura claims that he is actually the victim, claiming that Yvette \u201ccame across aggressively.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a minority myself ( gay and a Latino man) and have the utmost empathy for people,\u201d Moura wrote in an email to amNewYork. \u201cShe threw me into a racial war that I do not belong to, and never started \u2014 putting my integrity and safety at risk.\u201d Moura told amNewYork that he has received about 200 threats since late November.\n\nAfter charging that the incident was \u201can opportunist stunt,\u201d he charged that \u201cthe accusations stated against me are false and constitute as libel/slander.\u201d\n\nManhattan District Attorney Cy Vance\u2019s office declined to comment."}}
