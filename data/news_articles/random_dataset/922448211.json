As per PTI, the crash took place around 10.30 am.\n\nAn IAF spokesperson confirmed that the MiG-29 aircraft was on a training mission from an Air Force base near Jalandhar. \"The aircraft had developed a technical snag and the pilot ejected safely as he was unable to control the aircraft,\" he said.\n\nThe official said the pilot has been rescued by a helicopter and a Court of Inquiry has been ordered to investigate the cause of the accident.\n\nIt may be recalled that the IAF has lost several MiG 21 trainers and MiG 29 fighter jets in crashes due to technical snag in recent years."}}
