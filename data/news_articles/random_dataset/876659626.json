Sharon Malcolm, R-Kanawha, passed away in her sleep. She was 72.\n\nHanshaw and his wife, Kirsten, released the following statement Monday: \u201cIt is with great shock and sadness that we mourn the sudden loss of Delegate Malcolm,\u201d Hanshaw said. \u201cSharon was a fierce public servant, who passionately stood in defense of the principles she held dear. On behalf of her friends and colleagues in the House, Kirsten and I extend our deepest prayers and sympathies to Sharon\u2019s family and friends in this time of grief.\u201d\n\nMalcolm served the 39th District, which includes most of northern Kanawha County bordering Jackson and Roane counties. She was appointed March 22, 2018 to replace former delegate Ron Walters, who resigned after he was accused of forging a signature on a lien. As part of a deal made with county prosecutors, Walters agreed to not seek public office.\n\nDuring the 2018 midterm elections, Malcolm ran for and won election to the 39th District seat as the permanent representative. Before becoming a lawmaker, Malcolm was the first woman assistant doorkeeper of the House and the first woman assistant sergeant-at-arms for the state Senate. She is a retired state employee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s with great sadness that I ask West Virginians to join me in praying for the family of Delegate Sharon Malcolm as they mourn her passing,\u201d said Melody Potter, chairwoman of the West Virginia Republican Party. \u201cDelegate Malcolm was a strong leader for her district in the West Virginia House of Delegates. She was hardworking, passionate, and stood strong in her conservative values.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2019 legislative session, Malcolm was involved in an incident where House Minority Whip Mike Caputo, D-Marion, allegedly kicked open a door which struck an assistant doorkeeper.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint filed by Capitol Police in Kanawha County Magistrate Court, Caputo \u2014 after being angered by an anti-Muslim display placed outside the House Chamber \u2014 pushed or kicked the door to the chamber open, hitting assistant doorkeeper Logan Casterline. Witnesses saw Caputo hit Casterline with the door, who sought medical attention afterward. Caputo also allegedly injured Malcolm on his way to his seat.\n\n\u201c\u2026Malcolm was interviewed after the incident and stated that while she was in the chamber, as the session was starting, (Caputo) stepped around her and advised her to get the \u2018F\u2019 out of his way,\u201d wrote Capitol Police officer J.C. Chambers. \u201c(Malcolm) stated he then took his elbow and pushed her out of his way\u2026Delegate Malcolm stated that she wasn\u2019t initially hurt, but she was sore, and later advised Capitol Police that she has sought medical attention for pain\u2026\u201d\n\nCaputo, who has since apologized for kicking the door, was supposed to appear before Kanawha County Magistrate Jesse Bailes Monday morning, but the hearing was continued until Nov. 12."}}
