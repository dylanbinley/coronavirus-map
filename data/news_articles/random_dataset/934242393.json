Bolsonaro sent the military again starting in May this year, three months earlier than in 2019.\n\nResearchers say there are worrying signs for a flare up in fires again this year as the peak season for blazes arrives in August through November. Government data showed last week the number of fires rose 20% in June to a 13-year-high for the month.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters/ADRIANO MACHADO Brazil's Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina, Vice President Hamilton Mourao, Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo and Environment Minister Ricardo Salles attend a news conference at the Planalto Palace in Brasilia\n\nMourao said in a briefing after the meeting that Brazil was being unfairly criticized over Amazon deforestation and that the government had inherited understaffed environmental agencies.\n\nFor example, Mourao said the government does not have enough personnel to stop outsiders from entering 1 million square kilometers of protected indigenous lands that are being increasingly invaded by illegal loggers and gold miners.\n\nPublic health experts and anthropologists fear the invaders are spreading coronavirus that could decimate Amazon tribes.\n\nKLP was one of roughly 10 investment firms to participate in the meeting. Norwegian pension and insurance provider Storebrand said in a statement the meeting was an encouraging sign.\n\nKLP's Bergan said the meeting was high-level and did not discuss specific details. The government invited investors to hold follow-up meetings with officials at a technical level, which will help to evaluate whether sufficient measures are being taken, she said.\n\n(Reporting by Lisandra Paraguass\u00fa and Jake Spring; Writing by Anthony Boadle; Editing by Daniel Flynn, Chizu Nomiyama and Daniel Wallis)"}}
