Profits and revenue will come in ahead of expectations following a bumper Christmas, AIM-listed Team 17 Group said. Multiplayer Nintendo Switch games such as Overcooked! 2, where players cooperate to run a busy kitchen, did especially well. Its stock jumped 9.8 per cent, or 37.5p, to 420.5p.\n\nA flurry of last-minute bookings for Christmas and new year breaks will help lift Ryanair's annual profits.\n\nThe Irish budget airline unveiled a surprise profit upgrade, estimating it will rake in between \u00a3806million and \u00a3890million, up from previous forecasts of \u00a3680million to \u00a3765million.\n\nIt followed an unprecedented number of customers who decided to book holidays at the 11th hour, and eager travellers booking their spring holidays earlier than usual.\n\nRyanair reckons it flew 1m more passengers in 2019 than it previously expected to \u2013 raising its guidance from 153m to 154m for the full year.\n\nIt wasn't all rosy. The group's Austrian arm struggled with intense competition and price-cutting that meant it had to sell tickets too cheaply to make a profit.\n\nBut the upgrade was a boon to Ryanair's shares, sending them up 5.7 per cent, or 87 cents, to \u20ac16.10.\n\nAnd the effect was contagious with budget rivals Easyjet (up 4.2 per cent, or 60.5p, to 1499p), Wizz Air (up 6.8 per cent, or 261p, to 4119p) and British Airways-owner IAG (up 4.6 per cent, or 29.4p, to 664p) all flying high.\n\nIn fact, IAG and Easyjet were ranked first and second on the FTSE 100's highest-risers table. Wizz Air was also fifth in the All Share league.\n\nAirlines were also on the up as oil prices started heading back down. When oil prices are higher it makes jet fuel, one of the biggest cost headaches for airlines, more expensive too.\n\nBrent crude, the global benchmark price, has now given up all the gains it made in a short rally after the US assassinated top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani on January 3, falling from a peak of $69 a barrel to $65 yesterday.\n\nBut the FTSE 100 still fell 0.1 per cent, or 10.27 points, to 7587.85, while the FTSE 250 shed 0.4 per cent, or 76.4 points, to 21566.67.\n\nPaper and packaging group Mondi lost 2 per cent, or 34p, to finish at 1678p after chief executive Peter Oswald said he would step down at the end of March.\n\nHe has been Mondi's boss for nearly three years and his departure follows a dismal trading update in October.\n\nElsewhere, Wagamama-owner The Restaurant Group was one of the day's big fallers, tumbling 6.9 per cent, or 11.1p, to 150.1p, after RBC Capital Markets analysts cut its rating from 'outperform' to 'sector perform'.\n\nBrokers think that between October and December it suffered as fewer film fans went to the cinema \u2013 as its branches are often in retail parks near cinemas \u2013 and with the Thomas Cook collapse affecting its airport pubs."}}
