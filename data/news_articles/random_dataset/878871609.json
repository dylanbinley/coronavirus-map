The film is a Slovak/Hungarian/Czech coproduction and stars Prikler's collaborator, Hungarian director and actor Szabolcs Hajdu.\n\nPower tells the story of a well-established politician who gets involved in an accident resulting in the death of an innocent person. The consequent efforts to investigate and, above all, to cover up traces leading to this precarious incident, expose the hidden machinery of political power in contemporary democracies. The film brings up questions about the true identities of important political figures and reveals stories hidden behind their public masks.\n\n\u201eForty shooting days are planned from November 2019 until February 2020. Locations include Budapest and different parts of Slovakia: Bratislava, Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica and the Gemer region\u201c, Prikler told FNE\n\nThe producers have already secured the entire budget of 1,590,000 EUR. The Slovak Audiovisual Fund supported the project with 600,000 EUR. The film was also supported by Kultminor, the Hungarian National Film Fund, the Czech Film Fund and Creative Europe.\n\nPower was presented as one of 15 European projects at the HFM coproduction platform at the Netherlands Film Festival in Utrecht, and was selected for the Coproduction Village at Les Arcs. It was also developped with the support of international consultants through ACE 25.\n\nThe estimated premiere date is set for 2021.\n\nProduction Information:\n\nProducer:\n\nMPhilms (Slovakia)\n\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
