(28494043)\n\nThe RAF Association has liaised with senior RAF officers who have arranged for the Queen\u2019s Colour Squadron to carry Jim\u2019s coffin into church. Personnel from RAF College Cranwell, RAF Waddington and RAF Scampton, including a bugler, will also attend the service. An RAF fly-past from RAF Waddington is also planned to take place.\n\nJim was understood to be the last surviving British member of the 1944 Warsaw Air Bridge \u2013 an allied air forces operation to drop supplies to the Polish Resistance. The dramatic 63-day battle cost the lives of over 150,000 civilians and destroyed large parts of the city.\n\nJim was wounded during his 37th mission with 178 Squadron at the age of 20, and lost the sight in his right eye. After the war, he was awarded 20 medals by six different countries, including the Polish Presidential Gold Order of Merit and the Soviet Union War Veterans\u2019 Medal.\n\nRAF veteran Jim Auton MBE in his retirement. (28494041)\n\nPaul Trickett, who cared for Jim for many years, said: \u201cHe was a truly remarkable man with many stories to tell. He was proud of what he and his comrades did for the people of Warsaw.\n\n\u201cHe campaigned tirelessly for military charities, and for the Warsaw Air Bridge to be properly remembered.\u201d\n\nAfter the war, Jim became an entrepreneur and exported goods around the world. He also helped to raise substantial amounts of money for military charities, for which he received an MBE in 2000.\n\nWhen he became seriously ill last year, he received a letter from the Polish Ambassador calling him \u201ca true friend of Poland\u201d, along with thousands of messages of support from Polish nationals via social media.\n\nAilsa Gough, Divisional Manager for the RAF Association, said: \u201cThe actions of Jim and his RAF comrades were instrumental in the struggle for freedom in Warsaw, and, as the charity that supports the RAF family, we wanted to ensure he received a fitting funeral.\u201d\n\nPhil Gough, Chairman of the RAF Association\u2019s Newark and District Branch Club, said: \u201cJim was a dedicated Association member who regularly attended our coffee mornings and made friends with other veterans. He was a lovely man, and we will all miss him.\u201d\n\nJim\u2019s funeral will take place at Newark Parish Church on Thursday, February 6, at 1pm.\n\nJim will then be buried in Newark Cemetery beside his wife of 70 years, Peggy, who died in 2016. Their burial plot is close to the Warsaw Air Bridge Memorial, which Jim campaigned for and helped to plan in 1989.\n\nYou may also like...\n\nCOURT: Newark woman trespasses on railway and prolific shopkeeper jailed\n\n2019 police data reveals hundreds of unsolved burglaries\n\nSaying Southwell causes big stir\n\nRead more Human InterestNewark"}}
