So after meeting a Frenchman 20 years ago who was working on assignment in Tow\u2019s hometown of Greenville, South Carolina, he moved back with him to France before living in Luxembourg for seven years. After they broke up in 2009, Tow went back under one condition: It had to be on his own terms. He was going to live openly and honestly in a way he never had the chance to do growing up in the late 1980s and early \u201890s.\n\n\u201cYou had no openly gay people in the community,\u201d Tow tells NewNowNext. \u201cYou had no role models at that time. You were constantly taught that you were going to hell. Because we\u2019re so close to Atlanta, the first thing everyone wanted to do was leave. I wanted this to be a place our community didn\u2019t have to flee and leave the first chance they got.\u201d\n\nGreenville took a big step toward transformation last week when South Carolina\u2019s sixth-largest city repealed a decades-old anti-gay ordinance. In 1996, the town of 68,000 passed a resolution stating that \u201clifestyles advocated by the gay community should not be endorsed by government policymakers because they are incompatible with the standards to which this community subscribes,\u201d and it was struck down on Wednesday by a 7-5 vote of the Greenville City Council.\n\nGetty\n\nTow says the ordinance, while largely symbolic, had long cast a shadow over LGBTQ life in Greenville. The city, for example, has never had its own LGBTQ Pride festival. Its residents are instead forced to celebrate June Pride month in neighboring Spartanburg, which is a 30-mile drive.\n\nAs the president of the area\u2019s local LGBTQ organization, Upstate Pride, Tow knew the ordinance had to go if Greenville was ever going to be a place where the community felt like there was space for them to exist. \u201cWe knew how much hurt and damage it caused,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe really wanted to attack the ordinance head-on and say, \u2018This needs to go because it doesn\u2019t represent what Greenville is today.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven though Greenville has recently developed a reputation as a relatively progressive enclave in upstate South Carolina, the ordinance\u2019s repeal was far from assured. The majority of its 12-member town council are Republican, white men over the age of 60, and Tow says many are \u201cconnected\u201d to Bob Jones University, one of the nation\u2019s most right-wing Christian colleges. In its student handbook, the university explicitly bans same-sex dating on campus and prohibits trans students from transitioning.\n\nPartially owing to the council\u2019s conservative makeup, the ordinance\u2019s repeal failed on the first attempt. After local religious groups packed a March 3 hearing, two councilmembers\u2014who LGBTQ advocates hoped would vote with them\u2014flipped at the last minute. The final tally was 8 to 3 in favor of keeping the anti-gay resolution intact.\n\nCampaign for Southern Equality\n\nIvy Hill, executive director of the trans grassroots organization Gender Benders, says the initial vote was a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d to the local LGBTQ community. \u201cWe heard some really hateful anti-LGBTQ rhetoric,\u201d Hill tells NewNowNext. \u201cIt was really painful, but they never had the power to legislate our dignity. Regardless of what they say, we\u2019re still here thriving in this community and have been all along.\u201d\n\nThe decision to keep the anti-gay ordinance in place was met with fierce opposition from the Greenville Chamber of Commerce. It feared Greenville would repeat the mistakes of North Carolina, which faced a nationwide backlash following the passage of its anti-trans bathroom bill in 2016. The law was amended after more than 200 businesses called for a boycott of the state, which the Associated Press estimated would cost North Carolina $3.7 billion in lost revenue over the coming decade.\n\nTow says the Chamber of Commerce immediately began reaching out to all the \u201cmajor power players\u201d in the area and asked them to put pressure on the city council to overturn the vote. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want Greenville to become North Carolina and lose millions and millions of dollars because of the black eye from this,\u201d he notes. \u201cThat\u2019s really what made the difference.\u201d\n\nJust eight days after the initial vote, the Greenville City Council struck a compromise on the ordinance. Council members voted to sunset all resolutions passed prior to 2016, which means the anti-gay language would be wiped off the books without needing to debate the issue of LGBTQ rights.\n\n\u201cAs soon as they had their final vote, everyone just erupted,\u201d Hill recalls. \u201cI don\u2019t really know how else to describe it other than it was just an eruption of joy.\u201d\n\nCampaign for Southern Equality\n\nLGBTQ advocates hope that the defeat of Greenville\u2019s anti-gay ordinance inspires further progress in South Carolina, and they believe some of those advances are already on their way. The very same day that the council overturned its vote, a U.S. district judge ruled the state\u2019s 32-year-old law prohibiting teachers from mentioning the LGBTQ community in sexual education curricula was unconstitutional.\n\nAlthough these regulations are commonly referred to as \u201cNo Promo Homo\u201d laws, Lambda Legal attorney Peter Renn said that phrase actually \u201cundersells the harm that these laws have.\u201d Five states\u2014Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas\u2014still have legislation on the books prohibiting the so-called \u201cpromotion\u201d of homosexuality in public schools, but Renn says South Carolina\u2019s law went even further than that.\n\n\u201cIt prohibited even the discussion of [LGBTQ lives],\u201d he tells NewNowNext, noting that LGBTQ people could only be mentioned during discussions about HIV/AIDS. \u201cThat only reinforced the stigma by implying that the only thing that students should know about LGBTQ people is their purported association with disease.\u201d\n\nEli Bundy, a 15-year-old student who was a plaintiff in the lawsuit to overturn the curriculum law, says it made queer and trans youth feel as if their identities are so \u201cunacceptable or unnatural that it couldn\u2019t even be talked about in school.\u201d\n\n\u201cI took sex ed twice, and both times peers of mine asked about queer relationships,\u201d Bundy tells NewNowNext. \u201cBoth times our teacher said that they flat out couldn\u2019t talk about that subject. It was very disappointing because that type of attitude feeds into a school climate of discrimination, not feeling accepted, and not feeling welcome in your school environment.\u201d\n\nCampaign for Southern Equality\n\nAlthough the law pertained solely to sex-ed courses, it had a much larger impact on student life. Many districts in South Carolina placed de facto bans on the formation of Gender-Sexuality Alliances on campus, and a 2017 survey from GLSEN found that 87% of respondents had heard homophobic comments in schools. Meanwhile, just 4% said their school had a comprehensive policy in place to prevent LGBTQ students from being bullied or harassed.\n\nRenn hopes that the law\u2019s repeal will \u201cmark a new day\u201d for LGBTQ students in South Carolina.\n\n\u201cThey have, up until this point, been deprived of an equal opportunity, to benefit from their education like their peers have been able to do,\u201d he says. \u201cGoing forward they will hopefully face a less hostile climate, one where this cloud of stigma and discrimination created by the law no longer follows them around.\u201d\n\nEven with the repeal of laws discriminating against LGBTQ people at the local and statewide level, South Carolina still has a lot of work to do to ensure that its most vulnerable groups are protected. The Palmetto State is one of 29 in the U.S. that has yet to pass a comprehensive law banning anti-LGBTQ discrimination in areas like housing and employment, and it\u2019s one of just three\u2014along with Arkansas and Wyoming\u2014that does not have hate crime laws at the statewide level for any vulnerable group.\n\nBut for the first time in a long time, LGBTQ advocates believe their state will one day see them as deserving of the same rights as everyone else. After last week\u2019s vote at the Greenville City Council, community members who had gathered for the hearing held a party and support space where they danced to Kool and the Gang\u2019s \u201cCelebrate\u201d and popped bottles of champagne.\n\n\u201cIt was a gay old time,\u201d Hill says. \u201cIt was a huge day for us and to see that joy after so many weeks of feeling defeated was a really powerful moment to be there for and to get to witness.\u201d"}}
