Parnell Guyton. pic.twitter.com/1jwA8YRcC5 \u2014 Birmingham Fire (@bham_fire) August 8, 2020\n\nGuyton, 47, was a UAB police officer for 16 years, and one of UAB\u2019s first COVID-19 patients after he was diagnosed in March. Guyton was in the intensive care unit for 59 days after that, 45 of those on a ventilator. He spent a month after that at UAB\u2019s Spain Rehabilitation Center before going home on June 30.\n\nGuyton\u2019s recovery was described as miraculous when he left the hospital, but he fell sick again in July and was readmitted. He died on July 31.\n\nAfter Guyton\u2019s death, UAB President Ray Watts and Police Chief Anthony Purcell issued a statement expressing their heartbreak.\n\n\u201cIf you knew Sergeant Guyton, you are fortunate and better for it,\u201d they said. \u201cHe was an exemplary officer and dear friend. Most importantly, he was a beloved husband and father, and our thoughts, prayers and support are with his family in this difficult time.\u201d\n\nGuyton is survived by his wife Fekisha Vaughan Guyton and their 7-year-old son."}}
