They are, presumably, referring to the Salem witch trials, when 19 people in 17th-century Massachusetts were executed on charges of witchcraft.\n\nUsing \u201cwitch hunt\u201d to decry purportedly baseless allegations, however, reflects a misunderstanding of American history. Witch trials didn\u2019t target the powerful. They persecuted society\u2019s most marginal members \u2013 particularly women.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeventy-eight percent of the people executed for witchcraft in New England in the late 17th and early 18th centuries were women. Jef Thompson/Shutterstock.com\n\nToo rich, too poor, too female\n\nIn my scholarship on the darker aspects of U.S. culture, I\u2019ve researched and written about numerous witch trials. I teach a college course here in Massachusetts that explores this perennially popular but frequently misinterpreted period in New England history.\n\nPerhaps the most salient point about witch trials, students quickly come to see, is gender. In Salem, 14 of the 19 people found guilty of and executed for witchcraft during that cataclysmic year of 1692 were women.\n\nAcross New England, where witch trials occurred somewhat regularly from 1638 until 1725, women vastly outnumbered men in the ranks of the accused and executed. According to author Carol F. Karlsen\u2019s \u201cThe Devil in the Shape of a Woman,\u201d 78% of 344 alleged witches in New England were female.\n\nAnd even when men faced allegations of witchcraft, it was typically because they were somehow associated with accused women. As historian John Demos has established, the few Puritan men tried for witchcraft were mostly the husbands or brothers of alleged female witches.\n\nWomen held a precarious, mostly powerless position within the deeply religious Puritan community.\n\nThe Puritans thought women should have babies, raise children, manage household life and model Christian subservience to their husbands. Recalling Eve and her sinful apple, Puritans also believed that women were more likely to be tempted by the Devil.\n\nPowerless people\n\nAs magistrates, judges and clergy, men enforced the rules of this early American society.\n\nWhen women stepped outside their prescribed roles, they became targets. Too much wealth might reflect sinful gains. Too little money demonstrated bad character. Too many children could indicate a deal with a devil. Having too few children was suspicious, too.\n\nMary Webster of Hadley, Massachusetts, was married without children and relied on neighborly charity to survive. Apparently, Webster was not meek and grateful enough for the alms she received: She developed a reputation for being unpleasant.\n\nWebster\u2019s neighbors accused her of witchcraft in 1683, when she was around 60 years old, claiming she worked with the devil to bewitch local livestock. Boston\u2019s Court of Assistants, which presided over cases of witchcraft, declared her not guilty.\n\nThen, a few months after the verdict, one of Webster\u2019s upstanding neighbors, Philip Smith, fell ill. Distraught residents blamed Webster and attempted to hang her, supposedly to relieve Smith\u2019s torments.\n\nSmith died anyway. Webster, however, survived the attempted execution \u2013 much to the terror of her neighbors, I imagine.\n\nThe accused witch Mary Bliss Parsons, of Northampton, Massachusetts, was the opposite of Webster. She was the wife of the wealthiest man in town and the mother of nine healthy children.\n\nBut neighbors found Parsons to be a \u201cwoman of forcible speech and domineering ways,\u201d historian James Russell Trumbull wrote in his 1898 history of Northampton. In 1674 she was charged with witchcraft.\n\nParsons, too, was acquitted. Eventually, continuing witchcraft rumors forced the Parsons family to resettle in Boston.\n\nStay in line, woman\n\nPrior to Salem, most witchcraft trials in New England resulted in acquittal. According to Demos, of the 93 documented witch trials that happened before Salem, 16 \u201cwitches\u201d were executed.\n\nBut the accused rarely went unpunished.\n\nIn his 2005 book \u201cEscaping Salem,\u201d Richard Godbeer examines the case of two Connecticut women \u2013 Elizabeth Clawson of Stamford and Mercy Disborough of Fairfield \u2013 accused of bewitching a servant girl named Kate Branch.\n\nBoth women were \u201cconfident and determined, ready to express their opinions and to stand their ground when crossed.\u201d Clawson was found not guilty after spending five months in jail. Disborough remained imprisoned for almost a year until she was acquitted.\n\nBoth had to pay the fines and fees related to their imprisonment.\n\nWoman v woman\n\nMost Puritans who claimed to be victims of witchcraft were also female.\n\nIn the famed Salem witch trials, the people \u201cafflicted\u201d by an unexplained \u201cdistemper\u201d in 1692 were all teenaged girls.\n\nInitially, two girls from the Reverend Samuel Parris\u2019 household claimed they were being bitten, pinched and pricked by invisible specters. Soon other girls reported similar feelings. Some threw fits, crying out that they saw terrifying specters.\n\nSome have suggested that the girls were faking their symptoms. In a 1700 book, Boston merchant and historian Robert Calef called them \u201cvile varlets.\u201d\n\nArthur Miller\u2019s play \u201cThe Crucible\u201d also casts one of the Salem girls as the villain. His play depicts Abigail \u2013 who was, in real life, a girl of 11 \u2013 as a manipulative 16-year-old carrying on an affair with a married man. To get his wife out of the way, Abigail makes witchcraft accusations.\n\nNothing in the historical record suggests an affair. But Miller\u2019s play is so widely staged that countless Americans know only this version of events.\n\nSystematic oppression\n\nOther Salem stories blame Tituba, an enslaved woman in the household of the Reverend Samuel Parris, for teaching witchcraft to the local girls. Tituba confessed to \u201csigning the devil\u2019s book\u201d in 1692, confirming Puritans\u2019 worst fears that the devil was actively recruiting.\n\nBut given her position as an enslaved person and a woman of color, it\u2019s almost certain that Tituba\u2019s confession was coerced.\n\nThis is why witch trials weren\u2019t just about accusations that today seem baseless. They were also about a justice system that escalated local grievances to capital offenses and targeted a subjugated minority.\n\nWomen were both the victims and the accused in this terrible American history, casualties of a society created and controlled by powerful men.\n\nBy Bridget Marshall, Associate Professor of English, University of Massachusetts Lowell.
