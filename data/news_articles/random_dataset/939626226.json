Those had to be filled out, sent back to the county clerk and approved. Officials were able to compare signatures on file and more to make sure a ballot was going to the right voter.\n\nFor the General Election, voters will now have to request an application for an absentee ballot.\n\n\u201cThe person has to request it so we know where we are mailing it to,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cWe do signature verification.\n\n\u201cWhen we send out we do signature verification. When it comes back, we make sure everything matches up. We have a record of it being requested, a record of it going out and a record when it comes back.\u201d\n\nIf someone would show up at the polls to vote, they have a record that indicates whether someone has or has not already voted by absentee ballot.\n\n\u201cI have no problem with the mail-in ballots,\u201d Rhodes said.\n\nIf there is still a question, they can make the ballot a provisional ballot which would then be reviews by the county commission operating as the canvassing board. They would determine if it got counted or not.\n\nTo date, Wood County has received around 1,000 requests for absentee ballot applications for the general election, Rhodes said.\n\nThe county clerk\u2019s office cannot mail the applications until Tuesday. It has been gathering people\u2019s information who are seeking applications so they will be able to send the applications on or shortly after Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are just taking the information and getting everything ready so we can send it out,\u201d Rhodes said.\n\nWest Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner recently issued a press release announcing the processes for voters to safely participate in the November General Election during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on guidance from state and federal authorities and health officials.\n\nIn the 2020 General Election, all registered voters can again take advantage of the robust in-person voting options, as well as the absentee-by-mail option, the press release stated adding West Virginia election officials have every resource available to provide safe and accessible options to voters, allowing each person to decide the safest method of voting under current law.\n\nCurrently, West Virginia is under a \u201csafer-at-home order\u201d due to concerns over COVID-19. The governor\u2019s order recommends residents stay home except to engage in certain essential activities, the press release said. Therefore, under current absentee laws that have been in place since 2001, all voters confined to their home during the in-person voting period because of COVID-19 concerns may apply to their county clerk for an absentee ballot, it said.\n\nAccording to Warner, all a voter needs to do is simply select \u201cIllness, injury or other medical reason which keeps me confined\u201d as the excuse for completing an absentee ballot application.\n\n\u201cWest Virginia voters should never have to choose between their health and their right to vote,\u201d Warner said in the press release. \u201cLet me be very clear. Any voter concerned about their health and safety because of COVID-19 will have the option to vote by absentee ballot.\u201d\n\nThe Secretary of State\u2019s Office prepared a report, with the cooperation of the county clerks from all 55 counties, on how the primary was handled and where several processes and opportunities were identified to increase the efficiency and ease of administration, reduce voter confusion, and provide a more accessible and expedient manner to request a ballot, the press release said.\n\nAs a result of the report, Warner announced the state developed and will offer voters a free, easy-to-use online absentee ballot request portal for the 2020 general election. Beginning Tuesday, voters will be able to complete an application using the Absentee Ballot Application Portal.\n\n\u201cThis remarkable tool will greatly reduce any burden on eligible voters to request an absentee ballot, assist county clerks with processing increases in absentee voting, and reduce errors and lost ballots,\u201d Warner said in the press release. \u201cSince 2001, the Legislature found it important to ask voters to apply for an absentee ballot. This online tool also allows our clerks to focus on the most important parts of the election \u2013 the health and safety of our voters and poll workers, and holding an accurate and fair election.\u201d\n\nWarner also is encouraging all voters to check their registration and polling location ahead of the November election at GoVoteWV.com. The last day to register to vote or to update a voter registration is Oct. 13.\n\nBrett Dunlap can be reached at bdunlap@newsandsentinel.com."}}
