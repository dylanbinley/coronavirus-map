Due to the number of incidents that has residents on edge; the roads used by the bandits to getaway in stolen vehicles have been blocked. During Thursday\u2019s interview, the Commissioner was asked about the frequent practice carried out by Guatemalans when crossing the border. Guatemalan vehicle owners license their vehicles in Belize and Guatemala and when they cross the border they change their license plates. Williams says that is nothing illegal about it.\n\nChester Williams, Commissioner of Police\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong or illegal in them using different plates when they operate in both countries. So long as the vehicle is operating in the Guatemalan area there is nothing wrong for them to use the Guatemalan plate. And if it is that they choose to come over to Belize and use the Belize plate then they can do that. Bare is mind thought that the law does provide that you can bring a vehicle into the country with a foreign plate and you can use the foreign plate for maximum of three months under a temporary license. So there is nothing illegal with that per say. What we need to do is to ensure that we monitor these vehicles because they are in our system and to ensure that when operating within our country that they have the requited license plates that they have been issued with.\u201d\n\nReporter\n\n\u201cWhat about when they come through Calla Creek and they change their license plate?\u201d\n\nChester Williams\n\n\u201cIt is licensed in Belize as well and if it is licensed to carry cargo then yes they can do that.\u201d"}}
