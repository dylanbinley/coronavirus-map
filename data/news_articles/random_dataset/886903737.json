And one brought an unexpected claim that more closely ties President Trump to pressure on Ukraine for investigations into Joe Biden and his son.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump began Sept. 24. In this occasional feature, WTOP will touch on the week\u2019s events \u2014 and answer some of the questions they raise \u2014 as this historic process unfolds in D.C.\n\nNov. 8\u201315\n\nThe inquiry expanded from a secure basement room to Longworth House Office Building Room 1100 this week, when the House Intelligence Committee welcomed their first witnesses in public testimony.\n\nOne brought an unexpected claim that more closely ties President Donald Trump to pressure on Ukraine for investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.\n\nAnd, on Friday afternoon, we saw a bizarre Twitter/TV conversation between the president and a former diplomat.\n\nIt all followed the release of additional transcripts from closed-door testimony, which reportedly continued this week during the televised proceedings at Longworth.\n\nRepublicans on the panel did their part to defend Trump. They dismissed the proceedings as a \u201ccarefully orchestrated media smear campaign,\u201d in the words of one Trump loyalist, Rep. Devin Nunes.\n\nQ: Did Marie Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony yield anything new on Friday?\n\nAs of early Friday afternoon, nothing of note compared with her earlier closed-door testimony.\n\nThe former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine did, however, put a human face on the account of her April ouster. In particular, she told of her reaction when she read that Trump had told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on July 25 that \u201cshe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI even had a physical reaction; even now, words kind of fail me,\u201d she told the panel.\n\nThe 33-year veteran diplomat also said she has a reputation for championing anti-corruption interests in Ukraine, and that those efforts might have upset some officials there.\n\nOr, in the words of George Kent on Wednesday: \u201cYou can\u2019t promote principled anti-corruption activities without pissing off corrupt people.\u201d\n\nTo that point, Yovanovitch was targeted prior to her ouster by a smear campaign involving Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani; Donald Trump Jr.; Fox News host Sean Hannity; John Solomon, a conservative columnist formerly of The Hill; and Ukraine\u2019s then-prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko. And she said that when State Department officials tried to issue a statement of support after her abrupt recall, it didn\u2019t happen due to fears that Trump might counter the statement with more criticism.\n\nShe also denied Lutsenko\u2019s allegation that she had given him a \u201cdo not prosecute\u201d list, calling it \u201ca fabrication.\u201d\n\nIn addition, she warned that these kinds of attacks are harming the State Department.\n\n\u201cThe State Department is being hollowed out from within at a competitive and complex time on the world stage,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring her testimony, Trump tweeted about his \u201cabsolute right\u201d to fire her. (This wasn\u2019t in dispute, though. Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said in his opening statement: \u201cThe question before us is not whether Donald Trump could recall an American ambassador with a stellar reputation for fighting corruption in Ukraine, but why would he want to?\u201d)\n\nThe president added that everywhere Yovanovitch had served had \u201cturned bad\u201d \u2014 including Somalia, which has a history of ethnic strife and civil war that goes back decades.\n\n\u201cAs we sit here testifying, the president is attacking you on Twitter,\u201d Schiff told Yovanovitch. \u201cWhat effect do you think that has on other witnesses\u2019 willingness to come forward and expose wrongdoing?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s very intimidating,\u201d she replied.\n\nSchiff said, \u201cWell, I want to let you know, ambassador, that some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously.\u201d\n\nOther reaction to that tweet was somewhat bipartisan, with both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and GOP Rep. Liz Cheney agreeing that his criticism of Yovanovitch was wrong.\n\nQ: Did we learn anything new on Wednesday?\n\nYes, and it came early.\n\nThe top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, told the panel that a staffer overheard the president pressuring Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland about an investigation into the Bidens on July 26 \u2014 one day after the Trump-Zelenskiy \u201cdo us a favor, though\u201d call.\n\nTaylor testified that those staffers had been at a restaurant with Sondland when he called the president. (It\u2019s an assertion that some former officials find concerning). From Sondland\u2019s phone, they could hear Trump asking about investigations, Taylor testified.\n\nThe aide asked Sondland what the president thought of Ukraine after the call, Taylor told the panel. \u201cPresident Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden,\u201d was Sondland\u2019s purported reply.\n\nLate Thursday afternoon, The Associated Press reported that a second Embassy staffer overheard the call.\n\nThe president denies knowledge of such a call. The staffer Taylor cited, David Holmes, has since briefed the committee; Sondland is scheduled to testify Wednesday.\n\nQ: House Republicans had their chance to interview witnesses, too. What was their line of questioning?\n\nTheir questioning was, in part, aimed to boost that debunked conspiracy theory regarding supposed Ukrainian interference in 2016. (For a little more on that, by the way, check out Isaac Stanley-Becker\u2019s piece in The Washington Post.)\n\nGeorge Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, further debunked this theory Wednesday.\n\nKent also said that he had been concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest when the then-vice president\u2019s son joined the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, in 2014. However, \u201cI did not witness any efforts by any U.S. official to shield Burisma from scrutiny,\u201d he said.\n\nThough Biden did withhold assistance from Ukraine to get Lutsenko\u2019s predecessor as prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, fired, diplomatic officials have said it wasn\u2019t part of an effort to quash any investigation. And, on Wednesday, Kent resisted Republican comparisons to the quid pro quo that Trump posed to Zelenskiy.\n\nShokin \u201chad undermined a system of criminal investigation that we built with American money to build corruption cases,\u201d Kent said.\n\nThe testimony backs Democrats\u2019 contention that Trump\u2019s quid pro quo benefited Trump only \u2014 not U.S. foreign policy.\n\nQ: What other transcripts of closed-door testimony were released this past week?\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee released testimony transcripts from five other witnesses (the names include links to the transcripts):\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who was listening in on the infamous July 25 phone call with Zelenskiy, said he had no doubts that Trump was asking for the Bidens to be investigated in exchange for a White House visit that Zelenskiy wanted. The National Security Council official also said that he was so concerned that he alerted White House lawyers, and that he was later kept out of the loop on Ukraine-related issues.\n\nFiona Hill, a former White House official responsible for Ukraine policy, corroborated other evidence that the president\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, was telling Ukrainians that a Zelenskiy White House visit was conditional upon Zelenskiy starting investigations into the Bidens.\n\nShe also related former national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s concerns about the situation:\n\nHe told me, and this is a direct quote from Ambassador Bolton: You go and tell [White House counsel John] Eisenberg that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and [acting Chief of Staff Mick] Mulvaney are cooking up on this, and you go and tell him what you\u2019ve heard and what I\u2019ve said.\n\nIn addition, Hill related how she was \u201cvery shocked\u201d by the rough transcript of that July 25 call.\n\n\u201cI sat in an awful lot of calls, and I have not seen anything like this,\u201d she said.\n\nLaura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary for the Defense Department, recounted how on Aug. 20, former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker had implied that aid was being tied to a statement about election interference, which would have lent credibility to a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\n\u2026 Well, Ambassador Volker described talking to an adviser to President Zelensky about making such a statement, making a statement, you know, disavowing election interference. And the way he described the statement I understood it to be a discussion that wasn\u2019t going to occur in the future, but that had occurred in the past.\n\n(U.S. intelligence officials concluded years ago that Russia actively meddled in 2016, not Ukraine.)\n\nCooper also detailed how the Office of Management and Budget told agencies that the military aid \u2014 which she said was crucial to \u201cdeter Russian aggression elsewhere around the world.\u201d \u2014 was frozen \u201cwithout explanation.\u201d\n\nTwo former assistants to Volker \u2014 Christopher Anderson and Catherine Croft \u2014 provided further detail to investigators about the pressure on Ukraine.\n\nCroft told House investigators that Ukraine had concerns \u201cvery early on\u201d about a hold on security aid. She also said that OMB had placed an earlier, unrelated hold on Javelin missiles to Ukraine because Mulvaney, who also carries the title of OMB director, was worried that \u201cRussia would react negatively.\u201d\n\n(Ukraine and Russia have been involved in a conflict since Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in early 2014.)\n\nAnderson told the panel how he learned of Trump\u2019s belief in the Ukrainian election-meddling conspiracy theory.\n\nAmbassador Volker told me that the president said something to the effect of the Ukrainians tried to take me down.\n\nAnderson also recounted how Bolton had warned him that Giuliani was \u201ca key voice with the president on Ukraine\u201d and that \u201cevery time Ukraine is mentioned, Giuliani pops up.\u201d\n\nQ: Who\u2019s up next?\n\nThe schedule, as of Wednesday:\n\nTuesday: Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence; Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, director for European affairs at the National Security Council; Ambassador Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine; and Tim Morrison, a White House aide with the National Security Council.\n\nWednesday: Ambassador Gordon Sondland, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union; Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russian, Ukrainian and Eurasian affairs; and David Hale, the undersecretary of state for political affairs.\n\nThursday: Fiona Hill, the former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia.\n\nEarlier:\n\nWTOP\u2019s Rick Massimo contributed to this report."}}
