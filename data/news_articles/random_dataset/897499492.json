Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties and damages taking place now. So far, so good We have the most powerful and well-equipped military anywhere in the world, by far!\u201d\n\nThe IRGC said in the statement that the attacks came in response to \u201cthe criminal and terrorist operation\u201d to kill Soleimani in the form of \u201ctens of surface-to-surface missiles.\u201d\n\nA US military spokesman for Central Command said that 10 missiles hit the Al-Assad Air Base, one missile hit a military base in Erbil and four missiles failed to hit their targets.\n\nThe IRGC further warned that a US response will be met \u201cwith an even harsher response.\u201d\n\nThe IRGC also threatened \u201cUS allies that are providing bases to America\u2019s terrorist army that any country serving as the origin of bellicose and aggressive attacks in any form against the Islamic Republic of Iran\u201d will be targeted.\n\nThe IRGC also stated that \u201cIran in no way sees the Zionist regime as separate from the criminal US regime.\u201d\n\nThe IDF has been on high alert since Soleimani\u2019s assassination on Friday while the government has remained silent on the developing incidents in an attempt to distance itself from the escalation.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday Netanyahu praised Trump for the strike on Soleimani and said that Israel stands with the US in its right to self-defence.\n\n\u201cJust as Israel has the right of self-defence, the United States has exactly the same right. Qassem Soleimani is responsible for the death of American citizens and many other innocent people. He was planning more such attacks. President Trump deserves all the credit for acting swiftly, forcefully and decisively. Israel stands with the United States in its just struggle for peace, security and self-defence,\u201d he stated.\n\nTPS"}}
