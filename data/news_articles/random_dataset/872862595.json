He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nBrett Kavanaugh should start suing people for liable, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can\u2019t let that happen! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nA Saturday story in the Times from reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly prompted the presidents tweets. Pogrebin and Kelly are the authors of a forthcoming book about the justice called \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.\u201d The pair reported they reached seven individuals who could further corroborate Deborah Ramirez\u2019s accusation.\n\nRamirez, the second accuser to publicly levy her claim, said Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face at a dorm room party during their freshman year at Yale. Kavanaugh denied any wrongdoing. (RELATED: Chief Justice John Roberts Switched Sides During The Census Deliberations: Report)\n\nSaturday\u2019s story also recounts a previously unreported incident that is broadly similar to Ramirez\u2019s. One of Kavanaugh\u2019s Yale classmates, Max Stier, told authorities he witnessed Kavanaugh expose himself during a campus party. By Stier\u2019s telling, Kavanaugh\u2019s friends then \u201cpushed his penis into the hand of a female student,\u201d Pogrebin and Kelly reported. The alleged victim is called Tracy Harmon Joyce.\n\nStier himself did not speak to the Times about the allegation. Unnamed \u201cofficials\u201d who communicated with Stier about the accusation confirmed it with the authors. It is not clear whether those officials were FBI investigators, Senate Judiciary Committee staffers or members of some other entity. Harmon Joyce has refused to discuss the incident, though several unnamed friends said she has no recollection of the incident.\n\nThis is the blockbuster \u201cnew allegation\u201d against Kavanaugh. Except it\u2019s not actually new. It was shopped to Senate Democrats at the time and they apparently found it impossible to nail down, so they ignored it \u2013 the same Senators who found the \u201crape boat\u201d allegations plausible. pic.twitter.com/0183DKr0q2 \u2014 Carrie Severino (@JCNSeverino) September 15, 2019\n\nHouse Democrats have floated further investigations and even impeachment of Kavanaugh. The House Judiciary Committee asked the National Archives in August to release records relating to Kavanaugh\u2019s service in the Bush administration. Kavanaugh served as associate White House counsel and then as staff secretary prior to his appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2006.\n\nThe Supreme Court will return from its summer hiatus on Oct. 7.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
