With the help of her family in August 2011, she was taken to Mulago National Referral Hospital where she underwent thyroidectomy, a surgery to remove part or all of the thyroid gland.\n\nHowever, Mr Shafiq Ssekandi, her son, says at the beginning of 2018, six years after the operation, their mother developed a small swelling on the head, which caused her constant and painful headaches.\n\nMs Mwesigwa was taken back to Mulago hospital to confirm the cause of the headache.\n\n\u201cDuring the check-up, we learnt that she had thyroid cancer and was advised to undergo a second operation because the cancer had spread to the head. The doctor said the medication needed to treat the swelling would cost Shs8m, which we did not have at the time,\u201d Mr Ssekandi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpon reading Ms Mwesigwa\u2019s story, Ms Lucy Nakyobe, the State House comptroller, came to the family\u2019s rescue, giving them the full amount [Shs8m] on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are so grateful to the Daily Monitor and Ms Nakyobe. We plan to take our mother back to Uganda Cancer Institute on Thursday for further checkup and treatment,\u201d Mr Ssekandi said.\n\nMs Nakyobe said the President rang her on Monday evening requesting that she reads page 18 of Daily Monitor where Mwesigwa\u2019s story was run.\n\n\u201cThe President asked me to reach out to Shafic Ssekandi whose contact numbers were below the story. When I called, he did not answer, but later he returned the call,\u201d Ms Nakyobe stated.\n\nTo confirm the story, Ms Nakyobe requested Ssekandi to show up with his mother the following morning at her office on Okello House in Nakasero, Kampala."}}
