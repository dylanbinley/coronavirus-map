Democrat Ferraro ran with Walter Mondale in 1984. Harris is the first Black woman to run for vice president on a major-party ticket.\n\nPalin's post included a series of tips for Harris, including \u201ctrust no one new,\u201d \u201cfight mightily to keep your own team with you,\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t get muzzled\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t forget the women who came before you.\u201d\n\nShe also warned Harris that \u201cyahoos running campaigns will suffocate you with their own self-centered agenda\" and urged Harris to \"stay connected with America as you smile and ignore deceptive \u2018handlers\u2019 trying to change you.\u201d\n\nMcCain and Palin were defeated in 2008 by Barack Obama and his running mate, Biden.\n\n__\n\n6 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says he\u2019s \u201ca little surprised\u201d that his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, has selected Kamala Harris as his running mate.\n\nTrump told reporters at a White House briefing that Harris \u201cwas very disrespectful to Joe Biden\u201d during the Democratic primaries, and said \u201cit\u2019s hard to pick somebody that\u2019s that disrespectful.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also noting that Harris \u201ddid very poorly\u201d when she ran for the nomination \u2014 she dropped out in December \u2014 and says, \u201cThat\u2019s like a poll.\u201d\n\nTrump is trying to paint Harris as too far left, saying she wants to raise taxes, slash funds for the militarily and ban fracking. He\u2019s also noting her tough questioning of now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his Senate confirmation hearing.\n\nTrump says, \u201cShe was my No. 1 draft pick and we\u2019ll see how she works out.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign announced his decision to pick Harris as his running mate earlier Tuesday.\n\nTrump last month had said she would be \u201ca fine choice.\u201d\n\n__\n\n5:50 p.m.\n\nVice President Mike Pence is welcoming his Democratic rival to the race after former vice president Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.\n\nSpeaking in Arizona, the Republican used the opportunity to attack the Biden-Harris ticket. \u201cAs you all know, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left,\u201d Pence said. \u201cSo given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and abortion on demand, it\u2019s no surprise that he chose Senator Harris.\u201d\n\nPence plugged the Oct. 7 vice presidential debate, scheduled to take place in Utah. \u201cSo my message to the Democratic nominee for vice president: Congratulations. I\u2019ll see you in Salt Lake City!\u201d\n\n__\n\n5:45 p.m.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden says he picked Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate in part because she \u201cis ready to lead\u201d and \u201cunderstands the pain that so many people in our nation are suffering.\u201d\n\nBiden says in an email to supporters that Harris can be the partner to help him deliver on his promises to make sustainable changes to the country, which he characterizes as damaged by President Donald Trump.\n\nReferencing his time as vice president to Barack Obama, Biden says his pick of Harris reflects a \u201cgoverning decision\u201d rather than a political one, noting that they would inherit \u201ca nation divided, and a world in disarray.\u201d\n\nBiden says he and Harris would be holding a fundraiser Wednesday \u201cso she can get a chance to talk to some of the grassroots supporters who have powered this campaign.\u201d\n\n__\n\n5:35 p.m.\n\nIllinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth says she has \u201cnever been more confident\u201d that Joe Biden is the leader the country needs after he announced Kamala Harris as his running mate.\n\nDuckworth was among the women the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee considered as his vice presidential nominee. She said on Twitter she will work hard to elect Biden and Harris, a California senator and former state attorney general.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all in for the Biden-Harris ticket and hope you will join me in helping ensure that he and Kamala are able to defeat Donald Trump and restore the soul of America this November,\u201d Duckworth says.\n\n__\n\n5:25 p.m.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama is hailing his former vice president\u2019s running mate selection, saying, \u201cJoe Biden nailed this decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy choosing Senator Kamala Harris as America\u2019s next vice president, he\u2019s underscored his own judgment and character,\u201d Obama adds.\n\nObama calls Harris an \u201dideal partner to help him tackle the very real challenges America faces right now and in the years ahead.\u201d\n\n__\n\n5:15 p.m.\n\nClimate activist Al Gore is praising Joe Biden\u2019s choice of running mate as a victory for those who care about combating the climate crisis.\n\nGore said in a tweet that Kamala Harris \u201chas made climate and environmental justice a top priority\u201d in her political career, and he said she\u2019d be a \u201cstrong advocate in the White House.\u201d\n\nGore is a former vice president and 2000 Democratic presidential nominee who once served as a Tennessee senator alongside Biden. Gore already has endorsed Biden and has since worked with him on his climate plans.\n\nBiden stops short of embracing some of the progressives' most aggressive timelines for eliminating carbon pollution from the U.S. economy, but Gore has praised Biden\u2019s climate agenda as ambitious and necessary. And Gore says proposals to overhaul the energy grid and retrofit existing infrastructure and buildings will create millions of new jobs.\n\n__\n\n5:05 p.m.\n\nIn her first public statement since Joe Biden named her as his vice presidential running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris says she\u2019s \u201chonored\u201d to join the Democrats\u2019 presumptive presidential nominee on the party\u2019s November ticket.\n\nHarris said on Twitter that Biden \u201ccan unify the American people because he\u2019s spent his life fighting for us.\u201d She said Biden would build a country that \u201clives up to our ideals.\u201d\n\nHer brief statement did not address the historic nature of her nomination. Harris is the first Black woman to join a major party ticket in U.S. history. She would be the first woman to hold the office if Biden defeats President Donald Trump.\n\nThe 55-year-old senator and the 77-year-old former vice president are slated to appear together for the first time as a ticket Wednesday afternoon in Biden\u2019s hometown of Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nThey will be formally nominated next week as part of Democrats\u2019 virtual convention. Harris will accept her nomination Wednesday. Biden will accept his nomination Thursday.\n\n__\n\n5 p.m.\n\nGeorgia voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams is congratulating Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris after Joe Biden announced the California senator as his running mate.\n\nAfter the announcement, Abrams tweeted that she spoke \u201cat length\u201d with the 77-year-old Biden over the weekend and again Tuesday. The presumptive presidential nominee called several women he considered for the ticket to let them know they were not his final choice.\n\nAbrams praised Biden\u2019s \u201cfocus on reaching out to every corner of our country\u201d and pledged to work for \u201cTeam #BidenHarris\u201d through November.\n\nThe 46-year-old Abrams remains a rising Democratic star, though her next move in the party remains unclear. She narrowly lost a 2018 bid for Georgia governor that would have made her the first Black woman elected to lead a U.S. state. She is considering another run for governor in 2022.\n\nShe has also formed a voting rights group that is working with the Biden campaign and other Democratic allies to help educate voters and prepare them to vote amid the coronavrius pandemic.\n\n__\n\n4:55 p.m.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Jim Clyburn says Joe Biden's selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate will energize voters ahead of the general election fight against President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThis is everything that we need to get people to turn out the vote,\u201d Clyburn told MSNBC Tuesday.\n\nClyburn's backing helped boost Biden across the South Carolina primary finish line, propelling him into victories in later nominating contests.\n\nClyburn says he and other Democrats will devote themselves to working toward Biden\u2019s victory in the November election, saying, \u201cWe are dedicating this entire election year to my late friend, John R. Lewis,\" the civil rights icon who died last month.\n\n__\n\n4:50 p.m.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is praising his \u201cdear friend\u201d and fellow Californian Kamala Harris after Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden selected the senator as his running mate.\n\nGarcetti is one of Biden\u2019s campaign co-chairs and a co-chair of the search committee that helped Biden navigate his options before making Harris the first Black woman to join a U.S. major party national ticket.\n\nThe mayor notes in a statement that he and Harris \u201chave been friends for many years,\u201d recalling their work together on then-Sen. Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign in 2008. Obama went on to select Biden as his vice presidential running mate.\n\nGarcetti calls Harris a \u201ctrue ally\u201d for people \u201cwho have needed a voice within the corridors of power.\u201d\n\nShould Biden win in November and Harris take office as vice president, Garcetti would be eyed as a potential successor for her Senate seat.\n\n__\n\n4:40 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is blasting Joe Biden\u2019s vice presidential pick, calling Sen. Kamala Harris \u201cphony.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Trump adviser Katrina Pierson says Harris \u201cwill abandon her own morals, as well as try to bury her record as a prosecutor, in order to appease the anti-police extremists controlling the Democrat Party.\u201d\n\nPierson says Harris has \u201cgleefully embraced the left\u2019s radical manifesto, calling for trillions of dollars in new taxes and backing Bernie Sanders\u2019 government takeover of healthcare.\u201d\n\nPierson calls Harris \u201cproof that Joe Biden is an empty shell being filled with the extreme agenda of the radicals on the left.\u201d\n\nFor weeks, Trump\u2019s campaign promised an aggressive response against whomever was selected by Biden as his running mate.\n\nSays Pierson, \u201cAt the ballot box, Americans will resoundingly reject the abysmal failures of Biden-Harris in favor of the America First strength of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.\u201d\n\n__\n\n4:17 p.m.\n\nJoe Biden has chosen California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate. It\u2019s a move that fulfills the wish of Democrats clamoring to see a woman of color on a major party\u2019s presidential ticket for the first time in history.\n\nThe 55-year-old Harris was elected to the Senate in 2016 after serving as California\u2019s attorney general. Harris competed against Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination but left the race before voting began as she struggled to raise money.\n\nOne of Harris\u2019 standout moments of her presidential campaign came at the expense of Biden, when she slammed his past opposition to school busing."}}
