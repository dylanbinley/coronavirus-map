Pakistan had wholeheartedly supported Afghanistan in its difficult times during the past four decades,\u201d the foreign minister told the Taliban delegation.\n\nPakistan informed the Taliban that their serious engagement in the peace process was appreciated, but that these need to be taken to their logical conclusion. \u201cThe existing, broad regional and international consensus for achieving peace in Afghanistan at the earliest provided an unprecedented opportunity that must not be lost. It was up to the parties to the conflict in Afghanistan to grasp this opportunity,\u201d the foreign minister was quoted as saying.\n\nPakistan also informed their guests that the Taliban-US talks since last year, strongly and sincerely supported by Pakistan, had now laid a firm ground for achieving a sustainable peace deal in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cA pacific settlement of the conflict would lead to a significant reduction of violence, end of bloodshed and long-term peace, stability and prosperity for future generations of Afghanistan,\u201d was the view from Islamabad.\n\nLater at a media meeting, spokesman at the Foreign Office was unusually tight-lipped about the programme of the Taliban Political Commission, saying, \u201cThis is a highly sensitive and delicate process that is being handled in a careful manner.\u201d\n\nHe was asked if the Taliban delegation would meet with other Pakistani civil and military leaders as well with the US Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad, who has been in Islamabad for a couple of days.\n\nThe Taliban Political Commission\u2019s meetings would go a long way to determine the progress of the US-Taliban talks and whether Pakistan could convince the Taliban to meet also with the Kabul government. The 12-member visiting delegation appreciated Pakistan\u2019s support for peace in Afghanistan, said the statement from the Foreign Office, while both sides agreed on the need for earliest resumption of the peace process.\n\nShah Mehmood reiterated Pakistan\u2019s commitment and continued strong support for all efforts in this regard. He also pointed to the fact that people of both Afghanistan and Pakistan have a shared history, geography and culture, Islam remains the strongest bond between the two brotherly countries. He added that the people of both countries had also suffered tremendously due to 40 years long conflict and instability in Afghanistan. The minister said that Pakistan has maintained for several years that there is no military solution to the complex situation in Afghanistan.\n\nThe TPC was told that it was in line with the teachings of Islam and as part of its moral obligation as a friendly neighbour that Pakistan hosted millions of Afghan brothers and sisters.\n\n\u201cAll these years Pakistan has also kept reminding the world not to overlook the hardcore political, economic, socio-cultural and ethnic ground realities in Afghanistan and its immediate neighbourhood,\u201d said the statement.\n\nLater at a media briefing, the FO spokesman said that he believed that Dr Maleeha Lodhi was replaced after the completion of her tenure.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there has been a slander campaign against the appointment of Ambassador Munir Akram, which is reprehensible. It must be noted that he is a distinguished and experienced member of Foreign Service of Pakistan and an eminent diplomat. His contributions are internationally acknowledged and recognised. He will assume his duties in New York soon,\u201d the spokesman added.\n\nTo another query, the spokesman said that it was the American president who requested Prime Minister Imran Khan to help in mediating a solution between US and Iran. \u201cPM supports a negotiated and amicable solution to the US-Iran stand-off. Pakistan will continue to urge all sides to resolve issues through dialogue,\u201d said the spokesman.\n\nAgencies add: Afghanistan dubbed the \u201cwarm welcome\u201d accorded to the Taliban delegation in Pakistan as \u201cviolation of the diplomatic norms\u201d.\n\nSediq Seddiqi, spokesman for the presidency in Kabul, told journalists the meetings in Islamabad will not help the Afghan peace process. He stressed the peace process would only prove fruitful when it\u2019s owned by Afghan people and led by the Kabul government.\n\n\u201cWe saw the Taliban members travel to Pakistan. Unfortunately, a protocol was accepted by the Pakistani foreign minister and they have met, but these meetings do not contribute to the peace process,\u201d Seddiqi added.\n\nHe blamed the insurgents for the continued violence in the country even during the landmark presidential elections held on September 28."}}
