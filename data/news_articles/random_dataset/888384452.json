In today's day in age, it's best to keep an open mind and question our actions. What are we doing?\n\nThe practice of drinking cow\u2019s milk begs the question, for the mass consumption of human beings, can it really be done in any sort of humane or ethical way? It\u2019s hard to think of a way it could be, given the simple fact that for one, a cow has to give birth in order to produce milk for their young. This means that if you are going to provide the masses with the milk of a cow, you\u2019re going to have to forcefully impregnate a cow, which today on most farms is done by artificial insemination. Second of all, the milk needs to be preserved for humans, so the baby is prevented from taking the mothers milk and is usually separated from the mother and taken away to be used for beef. Male calves are of no use to the dairy industry and generally less suitable for beef production. This means that every year around 90,000 male dairy calves in the UK are shot soon after birth and discarded as a by-product. Dairy cows are sent to slaughter after around 4 \u2013 6 years, or when they are too weak to continue producing milk. Their natural lifespan is around 25 years.\n\nFrom the perspective of the animal, and hopefully the human, it\u2019s heart-breaking, depressing and hard, and the animals are predominately kept in terrible conditions. These animals love, they fear, they think and contemplate. They are emotional just like us, and it\u2019s our lack of ability to see ourselves in all other life that continues this pattern.\n\n--> Help Support Collective Evolution: Become a member of CETV and get access to exclusive news and courses to help empower you to become an effective changemaker.

These are big corporations that, through lobbying, have basically dictated government policy when it comes to what\u2019s distributed as \u2018food education\u2019 in many different countries. It\u2019s ironic, because calcium is largely available in many plant forms. Furthermore, casein, the protein found in dairy, actually triggers something called metabolic acidosis. This happens when the body produces too much acid and becomes very acidic, which can be caused by multiple things, including the absorption of casein found in animal protein. In order to compensate for this condition, the body actually leeches calcium out of its bones, this helps neutralize the increased acidity.\n\nAnimal protein in general has been shown to be harmful to human health, while plant protein shows the opposite. You can read more about that here in this heavily sourced article.\n\nPerhaps this is why multiple studies show that drinking milk from a cow leads to an increased mortality rate and actually makes bones more prone to fracturing, not less. One example would be this giant study from researchers at Uppsala University in Sweden.\n\nThis became known to me through the work of Dr. Colin Campbell, an American biochemist who specializes in the effect of nutrition on long term health. He is the Jacob Gould Schurman Professor Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University. Scholars like Campbell are vital to the world, because they are among the few who actually examine and study nutrition and health, something that our modern day medical industry completely ignores. You can watch a video of him explaining, here. Dr. Campbell also discovered that animal protein (casein) can accelerate and \u201cturn on\u201d cancer, while plant based protein has the opposite effect. You can read more about that and which him explain in this article.\n\nIf we look at all other animals who don\u2019t consume the milk of another animal or after weaning, it is because they do not have the enzymes to break down the sugar found in milk. We are no different, and this explains why in some ethnic populations around the world, lactose intolerance is present in 90 percent of the population. A staggering 70 percent of the world\u2019s population has some degree of lactose intolerance. Humans actually never had this enzyme, and to digest the sugar in cow\u2019s milk, we had to develop the LTC gene, which was acquired by mutation. This is the lactase gene, which allows us to process lactose as adults. Clearly, we are not doing what is natural and in accordance with our bodies. I first came across this information from Katherine S. Pollard, a PhD at the University of California, San Francisco, in this lecture.\n\nMore doctors are waking up, The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) recently submitted a citizen petition with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change labeling on cheese to include a cancer warning.\n\nThe petition states:\n\nHigh-fat dairy products, such as cheese, are associated with an increased risk for breast cancer. Components in dairy such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and other growth hormones may be among the reasons for the increased risk for cancer. To ensure that Americans understand the potential significant risks, and resulting long-term costs, of consuming dairy cheese products, the FDA should ensure that the notice above is prominently placed on product packaging and labeling for all dairy cheese products.\n\nThe list goes on and on, what\u2019s presented in this article is simply a tidbit with regards to why big milk is going out of business. People are waking up. It\u2019s just not necessary.\n\nPerhaps the biggest indication that people are waking up is the fact that Dean foods, the largest milk producer in the United States has filed for bankruptcy. You can read more about that here.\n\nWhen it comes to health and cruelty, it\u2019s not just dairy, it\u2019s also meat-eating as well. It\u2019s very in-humane, not all that healthy, and is also destroying our planet.\n\nYou can read this article for more information about that: Another Study Suggests That Human Beings Are Not Designed To Eat Meat\n\nLet\u2019s not forget about that animal agriculture is also destroying our planet. There is simply nothing good about dairy, period. It\u2019s truly hard to make an argument in favour of it.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nWhy are human beings forced into believing things that aren\u2019t true, and that ruthlessly defend them so much? It\u2019s because our consciousness is used against us, and with regards to various topics, we\u2019ve been made to believe the opposite of truth for the purposes of control, profit, greed and ego. Many may have a hard time accepting that our federal health regulatory agencies, or big corporations for example can be so corrupt, but they are. The positive thing is that many truths are not surfacing, as truth cannot stay hidden for long. We live in a world with beautiful people, and there are many great things about our planet. Compassion and empathy are returning to our planet, and that\u2019s the backbone as to why the dairy industry continues to struggle. Let\u2019s keep the awareness going! How have we been made to believe that it\u2019s ok to treat other lifeforms in the manner that we treat them?"}}
