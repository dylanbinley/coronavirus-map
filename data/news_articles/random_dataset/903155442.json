SUBMITTED PHOTOAnushka Sharma (left) is leading a project with Enactus Medicine Hat College to build habitats for local bee populations who are crucial to agriculture.\n\nA new initiative at Medicine Hat College will have students research optimal living conditions and develop habitats for local bee populations that are crucial to agriculture.\n\nThe project, \u201cTo-Bee-Continued,\u201d is a partnership between Enactus MHC and the school\u2019s environmental technology program, which is funded by a $5,000 donation from the RBC Foundation and Community Foundations Canada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unique, because we\u2019re not targeting honeybees,\u201d Anushka Sharma, an MHC business student and project lead, told the News. \u201cWe\u2019re just concerned about the sustainability of bees in Medicine Hat and area.\u201d\n\nThey will be developing \u201clittle habitats\u201d for these bee species, such as the alfalfa leafcutter and alkali bees, which are integral to the ecosystem, she said.\n\n\u201cBees help in pollination, which ultimately helps a lot in farming, growing food and our livelihood, which are essential parts of our lives here in Alberta,\u201d said Sharma.\u201dThey\u2019re a big helping hand. That\u2019s why they\u2019re critical to our environment.\u201d\n\nSharma says her team is in the initial planning stages, conducting experiments in their biology lab with the hope of moving their work outdoors in the spring.\n\n\u201cNow we know what we have to do, with planting seeds and experimenting, but we\u2019re waiting for suitable weather conditions for it,\u201d she said.\n\nThis project has been in the works for the past half year, Sharma added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing this for everyone, not just because it\u2019s a fad to save the bees. It\u2019s really critically important that these different sorts of bees are paid attention to before they\u2019re in danger of extinction,\u201d she said.\n\nEnactus is open to students from all educational backgrounds, with an emphasis on the 17 UN sustainability goals.\n\n\u201cYou just have to be a student here and can just start volunteering with us. No matter what program you\u2019re from, we\u2019ll find something that suits everyone\u2019s interests and skills,\u201d said Sharma.\n\nShare this story:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
