The opportunity to have influence over developments in the region that we haven\u2019t had until now.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we are at the table to have that voice. It is one vote but it can be an important vote.\u201d\n\nIn terms of the risks of not backing the SDP, Ms Jones said they would not be at the table and so would have no say over any proposals in Merthyr Tydfil.\n\nMerthyr Tydfil Council adopted its current LDP in 2011 and it runs out in 2021.\n\nIt is currently reviewing this plan, which is expected to be adopted in January next year."}}
