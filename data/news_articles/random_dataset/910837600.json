They came to my house on Thursday afternoon and asked the names of my husband and father-in-law,\u201d said a woman resident of the Kotwali area after a visit by a dozen policemen.\n\n\u201cThey alleged that my husband had been involved in anti-CAA violence in December and February. My husband supplies food to the Shah Jama Idgah (site of the largest dharna in Aligarh) but never participated in any protest.\u201d\n\nThe woman, who didn\u2019t want to be identified, was particularly agitated that \u201cthe police also asked the names of my two children and jotted them down on a register\u201d.\n\nThe latest drive comes despite a solemn promise by the police on March 1, when they persuaded a few thousand women to vacate the Quarsi Road Bypass in Aligarh City, not to harass any protesters or their families without evidence of their direct involvement in any violence.\n\n\u201cNo action will be taken against the protesters without a proper inquiry,\u201d circle officer Anil Samania had declared.\n\nRanjeet Singh, additional city magistrate, Aligarh, however, claimed the campaign was meant to reassure the women who were being forced to participate in the dharnas with threats.\n\n\u201cMany women had complained that criminals were forcing them to participate in the protests. So we started the door-to-door campaign to interact with households and prevent any unpleasant situation. (During the visits) some women said their husbands too were forcing them against their wishes to join the dharna,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are collecting the names of the provocateurs and will summon them to police stations and warn them. We have served notices to 250 people and are identifying more.\u201d\n\nA senior police officer in Lucknow argued that the force was merely doing \u201ccommunity policing to keep people away from the anti-CAA protests\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s a preemptive measure to prevent the protesters from occupying any new place in the city. We are doing this at many places, including Aligarh, Allahabad and Sambhal.\u201d\n\nAMU gesture\n\nMembers of the Aligarh Muslim University have decided to collect Rs 1 crore to help the victims of the Delhi riots.\n\n\u201cOur students and teachers, and the Resident Doctor\u2019s Association at the medical college on the campus, have begun collecting the money. It will be given to victims of the Delhi violence whatever their religion: Hindu, Muslim, Sikh,\u201d said Najmul Islam, secretary of the AMU Teacher\u2019s Association.\n\nAbdul Hamid, registrar, said: \u201cWe have given two bank account numbers to those who want to donate for the cause. The AMU alumni too are donating. A committee has been formed whose members will meet the victims and give them the money.\u201d"}}
