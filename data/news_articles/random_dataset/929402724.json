Instead, it\u2019s to help us evaluate how well the SOPs and our preparedness naturally.\n\n\u201cFor example in the first week we may take samples from 50 schools. We will then evaluate how well the SOPs worked, how many schools are fully prepared, how many are 50 per cent ready and how many haven\u2019t started yet in order to gauge the level of preparedness.\n\nRadzi said it was important to see the SOPs in real-world conditions as the schools would resume operations in unprecedented circumstances resulting from the world-stopping Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nNext week, schools in Terengganu, Kelantan, Kedah and Johor will open on Wednesday and Thursday while in other states Wednesday till Friday.\n\nThe minister said the SOPs will be adjusted and fine-tuned over the weekend based on observations.\n\n\u201cThis is a long-term assessment and no one can predict if it will be successful or not. We will however do our best to implement every possible SOP,\u201d said Radzi.\n\n\u201cSay 2,000 schools reopen, we will identify 10 issues that need attention, we will fine tune it and then from time to time continue to improve on it.\n\nOn June 10, the ministry announced the reopening of public schools to examinations students from June 24.\n\nRadzi said at the time that decision was made with advice from the Health Ministry and the National Security Council (NSC), and will involve around 2,000 schools involving nearly 500,444 students.\n\nThe minister reminded all parents and teachers to cooperate in order to achieve full compliance with the new norms of life alongside Covid-19\n\nHe said apart from teachers taking on the extra role of performing temperature checks and making sure the students eat their meals in classrooms, parents must also assist through their compliance with rules introduced when they send and pick up their children from schools.\n\nSchools remain closed indefinitely for students other than those sitting for the aforementioned examinations.\n\nMalaysia reported eight new Covid-19 infections yesterday but active cases fell below the 1,000-patient mark for the first time in months."}}
