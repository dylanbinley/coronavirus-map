In April 2018, Kim announced his country no longer needs such tests. That decision helped pave the way for nearly two years of negotiations with the United States, which are now stalled.\n\nPeople watch a TV screen showing a file image of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump, left, during a news program at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, Dec. 31, 2019.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who has met with Kim three times, has said the North Korean leader personally promised to not resume ICBM or nuclear tests, though the two leaders never formalized that agreement.\n\nSpeaking late Tuesday, Trump appeared to downplay the importance of Kim\u2019s threats, saying his relationship with Kim remains \u201cvery good.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s representing his country. I\u2019m representing my country. We have to do what we have to do. But he did sign a contract. He did sign an agreement talking about denuclearization,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a man of his word. So I think we\u2019re going to find out. But I think he\u2019s a man of his word,\u201d Trump added.\n\nEarlier, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it would be \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d if Kim reneged on his commitments to Trump.\n\n\u201cHe made those commitments to President Trump in exchange for President Trump agreeing not to conduct large-scale military exercises,\u201d Pompeo told CBS. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived up to our commitments. We continue to hold out hope that he\u2019ll live up to his as well.\u201d\n\nFILE - People watch a TV screen showing a file image of a ground test of North Korea's rocket engine during a news program at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, Dec. 9, 2019.\n\nStill a chance for talks?\n\nIn his comments Wednesday, Kim did not appear to formally abandon talks with the U.S., but did unveil a new, firmer stance toward negotiations with Washington.\n\nNorth Korea will continue developing its \u201cpowerful nuclear deterrent,\u201d Kim said, warning of an unspecified \u201cshocking actual action.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe DPRK will steadily develop necessary and prerequisite strategic weapons for the security of the state until the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy,\u201d Kim said, using the acronym for North Korea\u2019s official name.\n\n\u201cThe world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,\u201d Kim said, adding, \u201cWe cannot give up the security of our future just for the visible economic results.\u201d\n\nThose comments appear to link North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons to its economic success \u2014 a rejection of Washington\u2019s argument that scrapping nuclear weapons guarantees economic prosperity, said Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based senior adviser for Northeast Asia and nuclear policy at the International Crisis Group.\n\n\u201cKim\u2019s message was measured, calculated, and calm. He sounds intent that they will resume weapons testing, including long-range missiles, and that it\u2019s just a matter of time and circumstance until Pyongyang tests a new strategic weapon,\u201d Kim said.\n\n\u201cWe can expect Pyongyang to take a harder line this year, but Kim has still left the door open to diplomacy and kept the ball in Washington\u2019s court by saying that any chance for denuclearization is contingent upon the U.S.\u2019 actions and intentions,\u201d she added.\n\nFILE - U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un sign documents that acknowledge the progress of the talks and pledge to keep momentum going, at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa island in Singapore, June 12, 2018.\n\nTalks stalled\n\nIn his 2019 New Year\u2019s speech, Kim warned he may take a \u201cnew way\u201d unless the U.S. changes its approach to nuclear talks. Kim\u2019s 2020 New Year\u2019s comments did not specifically reference the \u201cnew way.\u201d They also did not explicitly mention Trump by name.\n\nAt their first summit in June 2018, Trump and Kim agreed to work toward the \u201ccomplete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d Since then, the two sides have not been able to agree on what that phrase means or how to begin working toward it.\n\nAmid the stalled talks, North Korea in 2019 imposed an end-of-year deadline for the U.S. to offer more concessions. U.S. officials dismissed the deadline as arbitrary and a negotiating tactic.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kim accused the U.S. of intentionally prolonging the nuclear talks. But he also appeared to leave open the possibility that the talks could eventually result in some modification to North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\n\n\u201cThe scope and depth of bolstering our deterrent will be properly coordinated, depending on the U.S. future attitude to the DPRK,\u201d Kim was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cThis is NOT shutting door on talks,\u201d tweeted Chad O\u2019Carroll, CEO of Korea Risk Group, which produces the influential NK News website.\n\nBut the negotiations have already effectively been dead for months, Adam Mount, a North Korea expert at the Federation of American Scientists, pointed out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible they are willing to return to the table to negotiate a more modest arms control arrangement,\u201d Mount said. \u201cBut in any event, we can expect a much tougher line that does not indulge the soaring expectations of the last years.\u201d"}}
