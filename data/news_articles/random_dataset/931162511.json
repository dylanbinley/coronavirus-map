Dave Senjem, who played an instrumental role in securing funding for mental health crisis centers throughout the state, said Tuesday\u2019s event was still important.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s needed,\u201d the Rochester Republican said of the crisis center. \u201cWe know that we need a new entry point for people in crisis.\u201d\n\nThe Southeast Regional Crisis Center will provide care to individuals throughout the 10-county region, offering services 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nAs the construction starts, the center\u2019s partners continue to search for a service partner to provide day-to-day operations with the help of the counties, Olmsted Medical Center, Mayo Clinic, the southeast chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness and several other partners.\n\nNationwide, the mental health system is struggling to cope. Nearly one in five adults in the U.S. lives with a mental illness, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nFrom 2007-2014, Minnesota\u2019s hospitals experienced a 49 percent increase in all mental health emergency department visits, which included substance abuse, for all ages.\n\nLocal health professionals have said similar pressure has been seen in southeast Minnesota, with patients in crisis often waiting days, weeks and months for admission to an appropriate facility for their needs.\n\n\u201cHaving a facility like this really helps decompress our emergency department,\u201d said Dr. James Hoffmann, president of Olmsted Medical Center.\n\nThe crisis center is expected to help facilitate quicker access to help, including community-based resources.\n\n\u201cIt will connect people quickly with the care they need,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Sutor, practice chairman for the Mayo Clinic Department of Psychiatry and Psychology.\n\nThe 16-unit Southeast Regional Crisis Center is being built on Olmsted County government campus in southeast Rochester, directly behind the building at 2117 Campus Drive SE, using $5 million in state funding awarded last year.\n\nThe center is expected to open next spring."}}
