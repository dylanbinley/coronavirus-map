The father-in-law opposed the couple\u2019s marriage because Beavers was a Christian. He also murdered Nesreen\u2019s close friend.\n\nCoty was remembered in eulogies and tributes as excited about life and devoted to Nesreen. He left behind a twin brother named Cory Beavers. The case will be featured on Dateline on November 1, 2019.\n\n\u201cCoty could carry on a conversation all by himself,\u201d his mother wrote on his family\u2019s memorial website, Forever Missed. \u201cHe could go on and on about the things he was passionate about. His passions included politics, world events, Egyptian and Mayan history, the existence of other life forms, 2012 predictions and doomsday prepping. He was a true expert on everything he cared about.\u201d In her victim impact statement in court, she said, \u201cWe all miss him very much. He was many things to many people. He was my baby, Adam\u2019s little brother, Nesreen\u2019s sweetheart and husband. He was Cory\u2019s life-long playmate, companion and twin.\u201d The mother worked in a law firm to raise her family as a single mother, according to The Houston Chronicle.\n\nAli Mahwood-Awad Irsan, a Jordanian immigrant, was convicted of killing Beavers and Nesreen\u2019s friend Gelareh Bagherzadeh, described by the Houston Chronicle as \u201ca 30-year-old medical researcher and Iranian activist who championed women\u2019s rights.\u201d Gelareh was dating Cory Beavers, Coty\u2019s twin.\n\nGelareh was the center of attention, in the best sort of way.

The television station reported that Bagherzadeh helped Nesreen leave the Muslim religion and introduced her to Beavers. Ali Isran is on death row in Texas for the murders. He\u2019s also suspected of murdering his other daughter\u2019s husband a couple years before. His wife and other daughter was also accused in connection to the plot.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n1. Ali Isran Snuck Into Coty Beaver\u2019s Apartment & Murdered the Man\n\nThis was a mystery almost too surreal to believe\u2026 All-new 2-hour #Dateline Friday at 9/8c with @JoshMankiewicz. pic.twitter.com/I67ztOAEPL \u2014 Dateline NBC (@DatelineNBC) November 1, 2019\n\nAccording to NBC News, Ali was accused of sneaking into the apartment his daughter shared with Beavers and shooting Coty to death. The murder occurred in 2012, shortly after Bagherzadeh was shot to death in her car by Ali and his son.\n\nBeavers had just walked his wife to her car so she could go to work and was ambushed when he returned to the couple\u2019s apartment, The Chronicle reported. He was only 28 years old when he died.\n\nNesreen\u2019s sister was charged with stalking in the case. You can read appeals court documents in that case here. \u201cAs a result of that investigation, the State ultimately obtained four indictments: a capital murder indictment against Ali Irsan, appellant\u2019s father; murder indictments against Shmou Al-Rawabdeh Irsan and Nasim Irsan, appellant\u2019s step-mother and half-brother, respectively; and a stalking indictment against appellant,\u201d the records say (appellant refers to Nesreen\u2019s sister).\n\nDaughter testifies in father's 'honor killing' trialIt was the first time Nesreen Beavers spoke in court about the murder of her husband. She spent most of the day on the stand, recounting her strict Muslim upbringing and the fear she felt after marrying a Christian man. 2018-07-09T22:41:32.000Z\n\n\u201cNesreen Irsan would not succumb to her father\u2019s complete domination and rule of her. And she left his home without his permission and went into hiding,\u201d said Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson, according to Women of Grace. \u201cThese two murders are linked by the belief on the defendant\u2019s part that his honor as a father and a Muslim has been violated by his daughter, who defied his rule and married a Christian man.\u201d\n\nThe court documents state that Cory Beavers, Coty Beavers\u2019 twin brother, \u201ctestified that he met appellant (Nesreen\u2019s sister Nadia) and Nesreen in class at Lone Star Community College, and they later attended school at University of Texas MD Anderson together. He stated that appellant was more opinionated and had more authority over Nesreen. He testified that it was common knowledge among MD Anderson students that, in 1999, Ali Irsan had murdered the husband of one of appellant\u2019s and Nesreen\u2019s older sisters. Appellant was \u2018nonchalant\u2019 about this information, and she was not embarrassed by it.\u201d\n\nThe documents continue that Cory \u201cintroduced Nesreen to Coty, and they almost immediately began a romantic relationship. Appellant found this to be unacceptable, and she believed that her father would not approve of Nesreen\u2019s relationship. Appellant did not like Coty, and she began making threats to tell her father about the relationship. During an argument with Coty, appellant said, \u2018I can\u2019t wait for my father to put a bullet in your head.'\u201d\n\n2. Coty\u2019s Twin Brother Described How Nesreen Fled to Their Home\n\nJurors sentence Ali Irsan to death for 2012 honor killingsJurors sentence Ali Irsan to death for 2012 honor killings 2018-08-14T21:23:54.000Z\n\nCoty Beavers\u2019 twin brother\u2019s account is detailed in the court record. \u201cIn June 2011, Nesreen appeared at the Beavers\u2019 house with \u2018nothing but the clothes she was wearing,\u2019 having run away from her father\u2019s house. Shirley McCormick, the twins\u2019 mother, allowed Nesreen to stay at their house,\u201d the court document states.\n\n\u201cThe following weekend, the Beavers family members began receiving calls from appellant (Nesreen\u2019s sister), and they could \u2018constantly\u2019 see cars driving slowly past their house, parking nearby for hours, and then driving away. At one point, Ali Irsan passed out flyers to the Beavers\u2019 neighbors with a picture of Coty, a request for information about him, and an offer of a reward. All of the Beavers family members began having trouble with their vehicles, including flat tires and other mechanical problems.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, the Houston Chronicle reported that Nesreen Irsan \u201cfinally had a night without nightmares.\u201d Then 30, she was able to get some sleep because her father had finally received the ultimate punishment: A trip to death row.\n\nThe newspaper reported that she had suffered from nightmares about being \u201chunted by her father and other family members\u201d after fleeing the family\u2019s home and becoming a Christian in 2011 (the murders occurred in 2012).\n\n3. A Memorial Page Contains Tributes to Coty Beavers\n\nThe family has a website and a Facebook page where people share tributes to Coty.\n\nIn 2012, Nesreen shared a photo showing her with Coty Beavers and wrote, \u201cThis was not only my first Christmas, but the first time I have ever spent a holiday with a family that loved me unconditionally. Coty made sure it was an amazing Christmas with all the gifts, but to tell the truth he was the best gift of all.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI will never forget the cute smiles he gave every time I got to do something so simple as decorating a Christmas tree for the first time or looking at the stars for the first time. I was obsessed with this man even counting the freckles on his arms or pushing in his button nose made me so happy. This picture, like so many others, makes my heart yearn to hold him and hear his voice again. You will always remain in my heart Coty. I love you so much baby, can\u2019t wait to see you again in heaven.\u201d\n\nHis mother\u2019s tribute continued: \u201cWe went for bike rides in the mornings before work and he would talk the entire time. Then he would continue talking as he put the bikes away, and even talk through the door while I was dressing for work.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cHe possessed a wealth of knowledge and information on just how the universe worked, how the world functioned, and all the secrets behind the Illuminati (they weren\u2019t pulling the wool over HIS eyes).\u201d\n\nA friend wrote, \u201cSure was fun fishing with you Coty. We were both so excited when we got a fish on our hooks. It didn\u2019t matter that it was a stocked pond. We got to say we caught a fish. Your Birthday is soon, you would have been 30. But now you will never age. It wont be long and We will be up there with you.\u201d\n\n4. Coty\u2019s Twin Eulogized Him as \u2018Passionate About His Interests\u2019 in Astronomy & Politics\n\nIn his eulogy, posted on a memorial page on Facebook, Coty\u2019s twin brother, Cory Beavers, recalled how \u201cgrowing up Coty was more than a brother, he was my best friend. We were in constant competition in everything we did. We built castles in the woods, magic lamps out of couch cushions, and ran from dinosaurs. No matter how angry we were with each other, he always had my back.\u201d\n\nCory Beavers recalled how Coty \u201cwas passionate about his interests including astronomy, politics, conspiracy theories and aliens. During the last long conversation that we shared, he tried to convince me that the world was going to end on December 21, 2012.\u201d\n\nCory recalled how Coty and Nesreen fell in love quickly after meeting at college. \u201cThey called each other Boo-Boo Bear and Co-Co Bear. I grew to love her as my little sister (and her baking skills). She was perfect for my brother and he was perfect for her,\u201d stated Cory.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been reminded twice this year through Gelareh\u2019s death and the death of my brother that bodies are not invincible but our souls last forever. The world does not operate on our schedule; however, through Christ the circle can never be broken. Make sure you know where you stand with God because you never know how quickly you will be called to His Kingdom.\u201d\n\nCory concluded, \u201cCoty\u2019s love, passion, and excitement for life will never be forgotten. We love you Coty, I love you, and you will always be more than a friend or a brother. You\u2019ll always be my twin.\u201d\n\n5. Coty\u2019s Mom Recalls How He Had \u2018No Malice in His Heart Towards Anyone\u2019\n\nIn her victim impact statement, Coty\u2019s mom said, \u201cCoty was a kind, compassionate young man who adored Nesreen, loved his family and his dog. He had no malice in his heart towards anyone. He was passionate about many things and a great conversationalist who never ran out of things to talk about.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cHe loved watching the news and really tried to keep the rest of us informed about current events. Life with him was never boring. His idea of a great night was to set up his telescope on the back deck and locate stars with Nesreen by his side.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cAt one time, we were just your average American family. But on November 12, 2012, Ali Irsan and his family destroyed life as we knew it forever. That was the day they ambushed and murdered Coty to restore honor to someone who never had any. Since that day, things have changed for all of us.\u201d\n\nREAD NEXT: Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s D"}}
