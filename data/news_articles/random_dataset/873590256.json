She spoke from a physician\u2019s standpoint, talking about the devastation caused by rounds fired from high-powered rifles.\n\nShe also talked about the psychological effects of mass shootings.\n\n\u201cThey cause a lot of anxiety, PTSD, fear,\u201d she said. \u201cCommunity-wide, we see people will have fear of crowded spaces, fear of going to movie theaters or concerts, even going to school.\u201d\n\nRamirez listed several contributing factors that have pushed people to become mass shooters.\n\n\u201cAdverse childhood events or childhood trauma, child abuse, neglect, the death of a parent, prenatal substance abuse \u2014 all lead to poor coping skills,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who commit these crimes are almost universally suicidal.\u201d\n\nShe urged anyone who encounters a person who could be suicidal \u2014 suffering from severe depression or making concerning comments \u2014 to observe the QPR method of suicide prevention: question, persuade, refer.\n\nGabby Easterly, Spring Lake High School student\n\nEasterly, a junior at Spring Lake High School, talked about the anxiety that lockdown drills cause students and staff.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here today to talk about a student perspective on mass shootings and how that impacts our day-to-day lives,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to put you in our shows. Since I\u2019ve gone to school, we\u2019ve always done active shooter drills. That\u2019s something many of you haven\u2019t had to do. You haven\u2019t gone to school with the fear of not knowing if you\u2019re going to walk back out those doors. I do that every day.\u201d\n\nBob VandePol, Pine Rest\n\nVandePol pointed out that those with mental illness are four times more likely to be a victim of violence than they are to be a perpetrator.\n\nHe maintains that it\u2019s those with suicidal tendencies who tend to be the most dangerous.\n\n\u201cPinning it on mental health is a frantic effort from people on the outside who don\u2019t understand, and who really want someone to blame,\u201d he said. \u201cOne element of truth is, if you think of every mass shooter, they don\u2019t have an escape plan. Every one of them knew they were going to die that day. Reducing suicide risk, I believe, is one of the best ways to prevent mass shootings.\n\nSarah Lewakowski, Mosaic Counseling\n\nLewakowski said the majority of people suffering with mental illness are not violent.\n\n\u201cThey are far more likely to be the victim of a violent crime,\u201d she said. \u201cA small percentage may be harmful to themselves or others.\n\n\u201cMany people who have been shooters have experienced childhood trauma and experienced a crisis weeks before the shooting \u2026 relationship, financial or something happened at work, maybe a victim of bullying, feelings of hopelessness or harboring grievances.\u201d\n\nLewakowski said the time following a mass shooting can be dangerous because there\u2019s a demand for quick answers.\n\nShe said common mental health outcomes after shootings include PTSD, agitation, irritability, self-destructive behavior, social isolation, flashbacks, fear, severe anxiety, mistrust, a loss of interest in pleasure and activities, guilt, insomnia, nightmares, grief, depression, alcohol and drug use and panic attacks.\n\nMike Rohwer, Ottawa Area ISD\n\nRohwer said that while the ISD works with schools, each district has its own security plan.\n\n\u201cWe try to coordinate and help them, but each school and district has their own context, their own way of doing things,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone wants to feel safe, and at the same time, what are we doing to promote the educational process?\u201d\n\nRohwer referenced several initiatives at local schools that attempt to shape the culture of the school body.\n\nHe noted there\u2019s been a shift in philosophy in regards to who is responsible for what during a shooting at a school.\n\n\u201cThe shift is to work with the teachers to give them a much smaller set of protocols,\u201d he said. \u201cWe then have folks we call incident commanders. They\u2019re the ones with the big binders and are issuing commands as needed.\u201d\n\nSteve Kempker, Ottawa County sheriff\n\nKempker said he\u2019s seen a massive shift in law enforcement in his nearly four decades on the job.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we now run church security programs, that\u2019s something we never dreamed would have happened,\u201d he said. \u201cBusiness has changed for us \u2014 the way we do our business and the way we equip ourselves.\u201d\n\nKempker said each of his officers was recently outfitted with a ballistic helmet and a heavier active shooter vest.\n\nKempker assured those in attendance his office takes any threat seriously.\n\nSgt. Chris Koster\n\nKoster teaches active shooter response drills for the Ottawa County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cThe first half of the class is doom and gloom,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we talk about the positive outcomes. At the end, we talk about avoid, deny, defend \u2014 what can you do to protect yourself, how thinking outside the box is a great advantage for you.\u201d\n\nKoster said, as opposed to hiding in a dark room, he now encourages people to flee if that\u2019s an option.\n\n\u201cIf you can get out, we encourage you to get out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this not just for schools, but for businesses and churches.\u201d\n\nIf fleeing isn\u2019t an advantage, Koster said to look around the room and find a weapon to fight.\n\n\u201cEmpower yourself for what you have: chairs, ink pens, a cane, a walker, ink pens \u2026 all these things can be used as weapons.\u201d\n\nJoellen Rhyndress, Healthwest\n\n\u201cThere are three stages that happen after mass shootings,\u201d said Rhyndress, who has responded to high-profile mass shootings across the country. \u201cThe initial phase is quite chaotic. ... Reunification centers are set up where people are coming.\n\nThe second stage is the homicide investigation. At this time, vigils and memorials often take place.\n\nPeople ask: \"What could I do? People fear leaving their house. They don\u2019t feel safe anywhere. It\u2019s hard for people to get services unless someone goes to them. \u2026 People feel guilty about surviving, and wonder if they were in some way responsible.\u201d\n\nThe final stage is the long-term effects that linger through the community.\n\n\u201cWhat we know about a mass shooting is that it can trigger people\u2019s prior trauma. People\u2019s perception of the world is altered,\u201d Rhyndress said. \u201cIt impacts their trust, and when your sense of trust is impacted, you\u2019re not likely to seek out new social situations.\n\n\u201cBasically, it\u2019s having the community adjust to a new normal,\u201d she said."}}
