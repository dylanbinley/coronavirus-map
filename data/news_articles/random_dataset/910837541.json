Then it can always be rescinded,\u201d she argued.\n\nHowever, amendments creating a right for patients to include a five-year clause in their advance directives were rejected, showing that the liberty and autonomy the euthanasia law purports to uphold are not as absolute as they are made out to be.\n\nThe European Institute for Bioethics (EIB), based in Brussels, commented: \u201cThe risk \u2013 which the initial law of 2002 was precisely seeking to avoid \u2013 is now that advance directives dating back several decades, whose very existence has been forgotten by the patient, will be somehow implemented when that person is no longer capable of expressing his or her will.\u201d\n\nIf the objective of the new law was to make it easier to eliminate unconscious or severely demented patients considered to be a burden on society, an important step in that direction was taken.\n\nAccording to statistics collected in 2018, the existing advance directives of 30,000 Belgians now alive have expired. In 2019, 7.156 Belgians who had made advance directives five years previously did not trouble to renew them.\n\n\u201cThis means doctors will not be able to meet their wishes if they land in an irreversible coma. Our law will put an end to that situation,\u201d argued Creemers. She did not take into consideration the fact that an unknown proportion of these citizens perhaps didn't actually want to renew their directives.\n\nThe infringement of the right to conscientious objection in the revised law is no less worrisome.\n\nFor individual doctors and healthcare providers, a new obligation is being created. When individually opposed to euthanasia for reasons of conscience, but also when opposed for medical reasons to a particular euthanasia request, these health professionals will be obliged to cooperate materially by providing a lethal shot. As soon as the law comes into effect, they will be required to give their patient the address \u201cof a center or an association specializing in euthanasia rights.\u201d\n\nThe explanatory statement of the law identifies only two such centers: the Association pour le droit de mourir dans la dignit\u00e9 (ADMD, or Society for the right to die with dignity), and LEIF (LevensEinde InformatieForum, or Information forum on end of life), both actively involved in pro-euthanasia campaigning. According to the EIB, both ADMD and LEIF want \u201ceuthanasia rights\u201d to be extended to the demented and even to people who are simply \u201ctired of living.\u201d\n\nThe Belgian Socialist party obtained the approval of an amendment that will oblige doctors to inform their patients of their decision not to provide euthanasia, either for conscientious or medical reasons, within seven days of the first euthanasia request formulated by the patient. The obligation to give information to the patient or to the patient\u2019s person of trust about institutions specializing in euthanasia rights will then take immediate effect.\n\nIn a note published in Dutch by the EIB, its president, Philippe Ballaux, and research officer L\u00e9opold Vanbellingen underscored that the new provisions regarding individual conscientious objection contradict doctors\u2019 \u201cfreedom of conscience,\u201d as the Belgian Council of State itself has made clear. This official organ of the Belgian Federation remarked that doctors would thus become obliged to \u201cfacilitate the implementation of euthanasia.\u201d\n\nRestrictions to the conscientious objection rights of healthcare institutions, introduced by the Belgian Socialist Party, also violate their specific rights, remarked Ballaux and Vanbellingen. Under the new law, no provision within hospitals, hospices and healthcare institutions will legally be able to prevent a doctor from giving euthanasia. It will indeed no longer be possible to give preference to other ways of accompanying a patient toward death, such as palliative care.\n\nEIB regretted that doctors, nurses and other caregivers will no longer be able to choose to work in a hospice or healthcare institution where the rule is that dying patients must be accompanied and not rushed into death. The provision also contradicts the \u201cprinciple of pluralism\u201d in the Belgian healthcare system and the \u201cliberty of association.\u201d\n\nAnother document published by EIB noted that in 2002, discussions leading to the euthanasia law had made clear that \u201cinstitutions have the right to forbid the implementation of euthanasia within their walls.\u201d\n\nHaving been adopted by the Chamber in plenary formation, the new law must now be promulgated by the King of Belgium in order to enter into effect. Before that happens, it may be transmitted to the Constitutional court in order to verify its constitutionality."}}
