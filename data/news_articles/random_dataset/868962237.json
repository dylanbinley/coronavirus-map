The deal will, however, help the lender to bring down its ratio of non-performing loans, a key banking metric for regulators and investors.\n\nBank of Ireland\u2019s said its NPE (non-performing exposures) ratio will dip below 5 per cent following the deal, while its CET1 ratio, a measurement of the strength of its core capital, will also increase.\n\nBy selling the dud buy-to-let loans, the bank will be required by regulators to hold less capital in reserve as a precautionary measure should those loans deteriorate further. This frees up that capital to be deployed elsewhere in the business or sold as loans into the economy.\n\nAffiliate\n\nThe loans are being sold to Promontoria 2019 \u2013 SGA, a Dublin affiliate of Cerberus, which has bought scores of distressed Irish property loans from Irish banks and Nama. Promontoria 2019 \u2013 SGA was incorporated earlier this month.\n\nBank of Ireland said it was \u201cthe intention\u201d that the loans will be serviced by Link ASI, an agent that services other loan portfolios for Cerberus.\n\n\u201cThere will be no change to the protections currently afforded to customers under the relevant Central Bank of Ireland statutory codes of conduct, including the consumer protection code,\u201d the bank said.\n\nFunds such as Cerberus are particularly attracted to portfolios of non-performing property loans because the Irish property market has rebounded so strongly in recent years.\n\nImmediate profit\n\nIf the borrower is able to repay the loan in full, the fund makes an immediate profit as it bought the loan at a discount. If the borrower cannot repay, the fund will take enforcement proceedings to secure the underlying property.\n\nSome borrower advocates have accused funds of using heavy-handed legal tactics against distressed borrowers."}}
