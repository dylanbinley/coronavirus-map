Plenty of examples to pick from this week! Exhibit A: On Friday, President Trump tweeted, out of the blue, what appears to be a classified surveillance photo from a U.S. satellite, showing the aftermath of a failed Iranian rocket launch. Along with the picture, he tweeted, \u201cThe United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir [Space Launch Vehicle] Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran,\u201d adding sarcastically, \u201cI wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One.\u201d According to CNBC, a defense official confirmed that the mysterious photo was included in Friday\u2019s White House intelligence briefing. Speaking to reporters late Friday, Trump said, in effect, who cares if the material was classified? \u201cWe had a photo, and I released it, which I had a right to do.\u201d\n\nExhibit B: On Monday at the G7 Conference in Biarritz, the president made an impassioned pitch for the next meeting to be held at the Trump National Doral Miami. \u201cWith Doral, we have a series of magnificent buildings,\u201d he told the flabbergasted audience. \u201cWe call them bungalows; they each hold from 50 to 70 very luxurious rooms with magnificent views. We have incredible conference rooms, incredible restaurants; it\u2019s, like, such a natural.\u201d This appears to be in clear violation of the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits a president from any \u201cprofit, gain, or advantage\u201d received \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d from foreign governments. (Oh, and guess who is planning a lavish holiday party and spending to the tune of $30,000 at the Trump International Hotel, in Washington, D.C. this winter? Why it\u2019s Attorney General William Barr!)\n\nWant more? Ok, Exhibit C: The Washington Post reported earlier this week that the president\u2019s zeal for finishing (starting?) his infernal border wall is so profound that he has purportedly instructed aides that they should just go ahead and break laws to get it done, and if they get into trouble, he will pardon them. When the predictable outrage ensued, the White House alleged that Trump was joking, their usual go-to response when he is caught out saying something particularly repulsive and criminal.\n\nIn other news: At that same G7 press conference, the president claimed that Chairman Kim of North Korea is such a swell guy that Melania likes him too! \u201cThe first lady has gotten to know Kim Jong Un, and I think she would agree with me, he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential.\u201d When it was pointed out by the press that Melania had in fact never met Kim, the White House did not say the commander-in-chief was joking. This time around, they came up with the following: \u201cPresident Trump confides in his wife on many issues including the detailed elements of his strong relationship with Chairman Kim\u2014and while the First Lady hasn\u2019t met him, the President feels like she\u2019s gotten to know him too.\u201d Trump did not share his wife\u2019s feelings toward Vladimir Putin when he argued from the G7 podium for Russia to be readmitted to the group, making it a G8. He continued to insist that Russia was not banned from the conference for its illegal annexation of Crimea, but because \u201cPresident Obama was not happy that this happened because it was embarrassing to him, and he wanted Russia to be out of what was called the G8. He was outsmarted by Putin.... President Putin outsmarted President Obama.\u201d When PBS\u2019s Yamiche Alcindor tried to stick it to the president, saying, \u201cWhy keep repeating what some people would see as a lie?\u201d Trump accused her of being an Obama-lover.\n\nOn Thursday, there was yet another staff shake-up: Madeleine Westerhout, the president\u2019s 28-year-old assistant, was forced to resign, apparently because she got a little tipsy and consequently a bit too loose-lipped at a dinner party with members of the press. She allegedly spilled secrets regarding Trump\u2019s family and the presidential eating habits. (What, not just Big Macs?) Trump said he forgave her and was sorry to see her go. (According to \u201cAmerican Carnage,\u201d a recent book by Tim Alberta, the president allegedly liked to refer to Westerhout as \u201cmy Beautiful Beauty.\u201d)\n\nLastly, in an example of almost unimaginable cruelty, the administration is planning to deport non-citizens who are trying to extend their time in the U.S. in order to treat severe medical conditions. Letters issued by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, obtained by ABC News, informed those applying for medical relief that agency offices will \u201cno longer consider deferred action requests,\u201d except for members of the military. ABC News reports that \u201ca 16-year-old with cystic fibrosis, a 13-year-old with muscular dystrophy, and a 4-year-old girl with cerebral palsy are also among the children whose families received letters denying their applications.\u201d"}}
