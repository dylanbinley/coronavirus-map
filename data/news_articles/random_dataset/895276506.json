When it got near my left leg it let out a vicious growl. I felt it was an imminent threat to my safety and it was close enough to inflict serious physical harm.\u201d\n\nThe deputy fired two shots toward the dog. It died shortly after.\n\nThe video then shows a woman come out of the house and tell the deputy, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t bite!,\u201d to which the deputy responds \u2014 \u201cHe came at me twice!\u201d\n\nThe woman also says in the video that she didn\u2019t come out of the house earlier because she thought the sound of the deputy knocking was the three puppies outside scratching on the door.\n\nRELATED: Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Office to begin hiring corrections officers\n\nThe deputy was originally at the house to talk with the people who lived there about their nearby neighbors in relation to a follow-up call for another police agency.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office said it\u2019s required that all dogs be contained within their own yard \u2014 whether that\u2019s by leash, chain or fence \u2014 and the sheriff\u2019s office can\u2019t be liable if the dog is loose.\n\nThe dog in this incident was running free in the yard.\n\n\u201cBut everyone else\u2019s dogs run loose,\u201d one of the dog\u2019s owners tells deputies in the video.\n\nLOCAL: Springfield Dollar General robbed on Christmas Day\n\nA deputy responds by saying, \u201cBut anybody else\u2019s dog that\u2019s charging at us in an aggressive manner like (the deputy) is saying he did \u2014 then you\u2019re going to get the same result.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office said they called the Clark County Dog Warden to see if their office could help with the removal of the dog, but the agency couldn\u2019t because the dog was already dead.\n\nA sheriff\u2019s office supervisor is heard in the video asking one of the dog\u2019s owners if they would like help with the dog\u2019s removal, but the owner then says they would take care of the burial.\n\nNo disciplinary action will be taken against the deputy who shot the dog, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nOne of Hunter\u2019s owners Tami Adams said previously she hopes deputies do things differently in the future.\n\n\u201cAnnounce yourself, honk your horn, if you even think somebody has dogs, honk your horn so somebody can come out,\u201d Adams said."}}
