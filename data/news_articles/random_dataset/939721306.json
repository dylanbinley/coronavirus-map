The police suspects it to be a case of death by suicide. \u201cThe actor was staying on the first floor of Neha CHS building, Ahinsa Marg in Malad (west). On Wednesday, a security guard found him dead and alerted the society members,\u201d an officer from the Malad police station said.\n\nGeorge Fernandes, senior inspector from Malad police station, said that a case of accidental death has been registered. The police are investigating the case.\n\nAlso see: Rhea Chakraborty shares WhatsApp messages with Sushant Singh Rajput, in which he\u2019d called sister manipulative\n\nSameer starred in a number of popular serials including Kahaani Ghar Ghar Ki, Geet - Hui Sabse Parayee, Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, Left Right Left and Jyoti. He also acted in films such as Hasee Toh Phasee and Ittefaq.

I don\u2019t think he was under any financial stress, had depression, work related or personal issues. He was a happy-go-lucky person, never took any stress and enjoyed life.\u201d\n\nAvinash added that during their last conversation on July 22, they talked about actor Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s death, and Sameer said, \u2018Suicide can never be an option.\u2019 \u201cWe were supposed to go live on Instagram and talk to people about staying positive. He was writing poems and web series and composing music and had done so much work since 2004. In fact, he took a break from acting and yet returned with good roles on TV. I don\u2019t know if he was depressed or not as we never had any such conversation and neither did I ever feel that he was feeling low or had mood swings,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.
