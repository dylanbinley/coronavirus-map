The April 2 letter began with Inslee telling the authoritarian Chinese ruler than he made \u201cmany friends in the state of Washington\u201d during his \u201chistoric visit in 2015\u201d and now they needed Xi\u2019s help with the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cYour experience in successfully managing the progression of the disease has provided us with many important lessons and has helped us to mitigate the impact of the disease on our people,\u201d Inslee told Xi. \u201cWhile these lessons have helped us significantly in blunting this outbreak, it is still having a very serious impact on the state. We are facing extreme challenges in finding the supplies and equipment necessary to protect our health care workers and treat our patients.\u201d\n\nThe SCMP noted, as Inslee did not, that one reason Washington had so much trouble obtaining supplies was that \u201cBeijing had tightened its vetting of exports of medical supplies, resulting in major delays of shipments of personal protective equipment to the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeijing\u2019s heightened screening followed complaints by some governments and hospitals that large quantities of PPE sent from China were below acceptable standards,\u201d the SCMP further noted, alluding to substandard or useless equipment delivered by Chinese suppliers to countries around the globe.\n\nInslee\u2019s letter continued with lavish praise for Xi\u2019s handling of the coronavirus, which Inslee saw as such a smashing success that Beijing could surely afford to send some masks, gowns, gloves, and testing supplies to the Pacific Northwest.\n\n\u201cIn reviewing the global progression of COVID-19, we note that the situation in China has essentially stabilized due to your government\u2019s leadership,\u201d Inslee wrote. \u201cI am asking you to consider allowing Washington State to access the enormous productive capacity of China to obtain critically needed medical supplies.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, the SCMP said Inslee\u2019s plea to Xi was brokered with the help of a naturalized American citizen from China named Qiang Wan, a Washington state-based software entrepreneur who chairs the nonprofit Tsinghua GIX Institute North America. The institute was created as a joint project by Microsoft, the University of Washington, and Xi\u2019s alma mater Tsinghua University, which Inslee mentioned in his letter. Wan himself has been in Beijing since embarking on a business trip there in December.\n\nTsinghua, located in suburban Beijing, was founded by Americans in 1911 to help prepare Chinese students who planned to study at schools in the United States, so it has long played a major role in U.S.-Chinese relations in addition to being one of China\u2019s most prestigious universities.\n\n\u201cWan, whose father served as the Chinese ambassador to Morocco in the late 1980s and early 1990s, said he had been moved to act after watching the virus take hold in his home state while in China on business. Washington state, which has recorded about 19,500 coronavirus cases and 1,000 deaths, ultimately received donations of an unspecified quantity of supplies from several Chinese government and private sources following the letter appealing directly to Xi,\u201d the SCMP reported.\n\nWan wrote an email to Inslee\u2019s office in March that was also obtained by the SCMP in which he expressed concern about the coronavirus outbreak in Washington, acknowledged political tensions between China and the United States, and hoped Tsinghua University could \u201chelp [Washington] State secure much-needed medical supplies and equipment.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, swiftly wrote a letter to Inslee acknowledging that Xi had received his request for aid and \u201cdirected relevant government departments of China to provide needed assistance and facilitation.\u201d\n\nInslee, formerly a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, is not the only U.S. governor to seek Chinese assistance with the coronavirus. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) in April praised the Chinese Communist government for sending 1,000 ventilators to his state amid a bitter feud between Cuomo and President Donald Trump."}}
