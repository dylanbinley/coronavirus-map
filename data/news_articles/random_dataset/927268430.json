Members of the Franklin Police Department also knelt in a sign of solidarity.\n\nFranklin resident Ndoumbe Ndoye, 17, was in middle school when she ordered a tub of skin bleaching cream for $10 off the internet.\n\n\u201c(But) When it came to my house, I threw it away,\u201d she told more than 1,000 people Tuesday night on the town common in Franklin. \u201cOn that day forward, I began to love myself again.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cKneel for Nine\u201d gathering was organized by the newly-formed Franklin Residents Confronting Racism. Spearheaded by Justin Bates, attendees knelt in memory of George Floyd, a black man who was killed on Memorial Day while in police custody in Minneapolis. The nine minutes is a reference to the amount of time a Minneapolis police officer knelt on Floyd's neck.\n\nThe officer, Derek Chauvin, has since been fired and has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He\u2019s due in court later this month.\n\nWhile Tuesday's demonstration was the first Ndoye had ever attended, she nonetheless bravely gripped a small megaphone and told the large crowd of her experience growing up as a young, black woman in a largely white suburban community.\n\nShe\u2019s lived in Franklin since she was 5 years old, and as she entered middle school, she felt pressure to dress \u2013 and consequently look \u2013 like her peers, most of whom were white.\n\n\u201cI was like every other girl, I was trying to fit in so bad,\u201d she said, buying white converse sneakers and Victoria Secret sweatshirts with the words PINK sprawled across to blend in with classmates.\n\n\u201cIt got so bad \u2013 I wanted to bleach my own skin,\u201d she said.\n\nNow president of Franklin High's Diversity Awareness Club, the high school junior said she\u2019s happy she made the decision that day to toss that bottle of skin bleach in the trash.\n\nIn Sudbury, two juniors at Lincoln Sudbury High School had hoped to join thousands of people who protested in Boston over the past few days.\n\nBut the parents of Caitie Sams and Kaleigh Barrera wouldn\u2019t let them, concerned they would get sick from COVID-19. So instead, the two 17-years old decided to spread a message in their own community.\n\nThey say more than 500 people participated in a peaceful protest Tuesday at Sudbury Town Center and Haskell Field. A Daily News photographer counted more than 100 while he visited between 4 and 4:50 p.m.\n\nThe teens worked with town management and the Police Department to put on the event.\n\n\u201cI think it took a different meaning when we started it in our own town,\u201d said Sams. \u201cThe main focus of the protest really shifted toward combating white supremacy and using our white privilege to speak out for people.\u201d\n\nIn Barrera\u2019s opinion, racial injustice is the country\u2019s biggest issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that (racism) is still going on,\u201d she said, noting that as white Americans, she and Sams need to do everything in their power to eradicate it.\n\nIn Sudbury, Sams felt empowered that the protest was led by young people.\n\n\u201cIt shows that we have a voice and we can speak out and show our beliefs,\u201d she said. She also thought it was powerful that police helped regulate traffic and handed out face coverings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s showing that we are working with them to bring change and I think that\u2019s really powerful,\u201d Sams said.\n\nBoth girls said they have already seen positive buzz from social media following the event.\n\nThey\u2019ve also received positive feedback from the town government, she said.\n\n\u201cThe town manager and the Sudbury Police Department have asked me to sit down with my co-organizers to speak about how we think the protest went and how we think Sudbury could make a difference,\u201d Barrera said. \"Even if we were not to hold another protest, we have made the first step to start making changes in Sudbury.\u201d\n\nIn Franklin, Town Councilor Melanie Hamblen echoed the Sudbury teens' words.\n\n\u201cBeing nice and doing good deeds are not enough \u2013 it is up to white people to realize that we have a lot of serious work to do,\" Hamblen said. \"We have to accept the fact that we are perpetuating social injustice by doing nothing.\"\n\nBates, the Franklin event's organizer, said that it was \"overwhelming\" to see the common packed with cardboard \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d signs and people of different ethnicities dressed head to toe in black.\n\n\u201cIf this is our first step, then I am now willing to see what the second step is,\u201d he said of the gathering, which was planned in less than 48 hours. \u201cThe people in Franklin are so willing to listen, act and continue to do so. I think this has so much potential.\u201d\n\nCesareo Contreras writes about environmental issues and technology. He can be reached at 508-626-3957 or ccontreras@wickedlocal.com.
