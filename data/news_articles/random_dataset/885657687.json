The government must drop all charges against Kem Sokha and release all political prisoners to prove that Hun Sen wants to have national reconciliation. We cannot accept it. \u201d the CNRP senior official said.\n\nTwo months after the arrest of Kem Sokha in September, Cambodia\u2019s Supreme Court dissolved the CNRP and banned 118 of its elected officials from politics for the party\u2019s alleged role in a plot to overthrow the government.\n\nEU trade pressure\n\nThe moves were part of a wider crackdown on the political opposition, NGOs, and the independent media that paved the way for Prime Minister Hun Sen\u2019s ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party (CPP) to win all 125 seats in parliament in July 2018 general elections, making Cambodia effectively a one-party state.\n\n\u201cFor this first positive gesture from Hun Sen\u2014attributable to increasing internal and external pressure\u2014to be meaningful, the ludicrous \u2018treason\u2019 charge levied against Kem Sokha must be dropped, thus eliminating all restrictions to his freedom,\u201d said the CNRP in a statement.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, such dropping of the charge would open the way for a reinstatement of the banned opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, which was dissolved in 2017 precisely on the base of this unsubstantiated \u2018treason\u2019 charge,\u201d it said.\n\nTeddy Baguilat of ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights said \u201cterming this as a \u2018release\u2019 is misleading and clearly an attempt by Hun Sen to ward off international sanctions on him and his regime, including from the European Union.\u201d\n\nThe European Commission will present Cambodia with a report on Nov. 12 on its findings on whether the country\u2019s exports should continue to enjoy tariff free exports to the EU under the Everything But Arms (EBA) arrangement.\n\n\"This is just another cynical move by Hun Sen to try and hoodwink the international community into thinking he is lifting his grip on the political opposition and should be seen for what it is,\u201d the former Philippine member of parliament said.\n\nRobertson of Human Rights Watch said Sunday\u2019s gesture on Kem Sokha is \u201creally too little, too late for the EBA preliminary determination on November 12,\u201d and called for a wider release of detained opposition party activities\n\n\u201cNo one should forget that while Kem Sokha has been unjustly confined to his house, the Cambodian government has been rolling up CNRP activists across the country, issuing charges against over 80 people, arresting and jailing dozens, and manufacturing politically motivated charges of \u2018plotting a coup\u2019 that totally lack credibility,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice in Cambodia\u2019s Banteay Meanchey police on Sunday arrested five of Sam Rainsy\u2019s personal bodyguards while they were staying near Poipet international border checkpoint. So far, 88 CNRP activists have been arrested and more than 200 activists have been charged for plotting to topple the government.\n\nReported by RFA\u2019s Khmer Service. Translated by Samean Yun.
