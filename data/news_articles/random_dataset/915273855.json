This week, the order expanded through a statement from the City of Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all safer at home, and that\u2019s not a suggestion \u2013 it is the law,\u201d said Garcetti. \u201cFailure to obey this law would result to a misdemeanor that could be followed by \u201c\u2018fines or jail time.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe City of Santa Monica also adopted these new measures as of March 23, clarifying that they are not adding new provisions but they are following the Governor's orders. Santa Monica City Manager Rick Cole highlighted the possibility of getting fined if one does not conform to the safety orders.\n\n\u201cThis will flatten the curve of infection and save lives in our community. Stay calm, stay informed, and stay healthy,\u201d said Cole in an online press release.\n\nBy the end of the week that the measures were instated, Mayor Garcetti tweeted that he \u201cis closing all public trails, beaches and piers within the county,\u201d in order to increase measures against COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThese are difficult decisions, but I agree they are vitally needed steps to protect the health and safety of our communities and save lives,\" said Garcetti.\n\nKohanghadosh said that \u201cit is very saddening to be spending so much time in isolation during our prime years of making connections,\u201d when he is motivated to go on campus to tutor students and help as many people as possible.\n\n\u201cI definitely miss getting on a grand piano,\" said SMC student Aviana Tiara Brown music major. \u201cI'm very grateful for the small keyboards that were loaned out to students who had no keyboard at home, I was one of them.\u201d"}}
