We call upon Belgian authorities, including city authorities of Aalst, to change their mind,\" Nashon said. \"We still have [time] until the carnival and hope reason will prevail, and the antisemitic floats will be taken away.\"\n\nThis week, three Belgian professors penned an op-ed regarding the influence these anti-Semitic caricatures can have on culture, according to the report.\n\n\"We do not want to commit censorship, but we do want to point out the danger of spreading this type of anti-Jewish caricature,\" one professor, Klaas Smelik, said on Belgium's Radio 1. \"In the past, it has become apparent what kind of influence they can have on the opinions of ordinary people.\"\n\nIn December, Aalst Mayor Christoph D'Haese said the parade mocks a multitude of different groups, claiming that a request for censorship is not an option for the town, according to The Jerusalem Post.\n\n\"We are neither antisemitic nor racist, and anyone who says that is acting in bad faith,\" D'Haese said.\n\nLast year, Aalst carnival lost its status on a representative list for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization after the mayor refused to remove anti-Semitic symbols from the parade."}}
