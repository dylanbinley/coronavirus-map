In today\u2019s edition: Peters throws New Zealand into the fray over Taiwan\u2019s WHO inclusion, more detail emerges on legality of lockdown, and a potentially major decision for the courier industry.\n\nThe government wouldn\u2019t frame it in such a way, but they\u2019ve made several recent moves which indicate they\u2019re not taking China\u2019s side in their geopolitical battle with the rest of the world, particularly against the US. Right now, there is a lot going on in this space \u2013 without getting too deep into it, some of the complaints being made against the government of China have a fair basis, and some of them are absurd. Within that, there is something of a proxy argument going on over the inclusion of Taiwan within the World Trade Organisation, which China is currently blocking, as it considers Taiwan to be a rogue province. Now New Zealand\u2019s politicians have got themselves involved.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering if it has even been noticed overseas, it has. Earlier this week, the Taiwan News reported on comments from foreign minister Winston Peters in favour of Taiwan being allowed to rejoin the WHO. Peters\u2019 comments were taken as a statement of \u201cfirm support\u201d, and the story talked up the friendship between NZ and Taiwan. The story also noted that PM Ardern ducked questions on whether she supported Taiwan\u2019s inclusion, which is currently being pushed by Australia and the US. At the time, the NZ Herald\u2019s Audrey Young wrote that public backing for the bid by Peters would cause fresh problems for the diplomatic relationship with China.\n\nAnd the Chinese government noticed, and made their annoyance clear. Newsroom\u2019s Sam Sachdeva reported that the Chinese embassy put out a statement, setting out their country\u2019s view, and warning that the one-China principle is \u201cthe political foundation of China-New Zealand relations\u201d. Well, that story was updated later in the day with the news that New Zealand is now formally backing Taiwan\u2019s inclusion at the WHO, it isn\u2019t just Winston Peters\u2019 opinion any more. For good measure, Peters also suggested that there was a split in opinion between the Chinese embassy, and the Chinese foreign minister, reports the NZ Herald. As Politik\u2019s Richard Harman writes this morning, this all has domestic political implications too \u2013 National\u2019s Gerry Brownlee has criticised Peters, saying the comments were \u201cunnecessary\u201d and risky, and says there\u2019s no way Taiwan will get a place at the WHO.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that there has been tension with China at each end of the Covid crisis for New Zealand. Early on, travel restrictions in New Zealand were mainly aimed at China, a point that also deeply annoyed the embassy. At the time, the ambassador called for restrictions to be lifted, before it soon became clear the only direction they were moving was towards more countries being added. Since then there has been a donation of PPE and other medical supplies made by China to New Zealand \u2013 this has been a major element of Chinese diplomatic efforts all over the world over the last month. Complicating it all \u2013 China is an intensely important export market for New Zealand, which will be crucial in any economic recovery.\n\nThere\u2019s one other bit to this, which illustrates how New Zealand is just one country among many grappling with a complex relationship here. Yesterday Newsroom\u2019s (paywalled) Sam Sachdeva reported that NZ has quietly joined a US-led alliance being called the \u2018Quad Plus\u2019, which includes countries like Australia, India and Japan. The Diplomat reports that Australia and India are planning to build a more united front against China, as both countries have experienced a marked deterioration in relations with the superpower. Whether we like it or not, there is an increasing sense of polarisation in these diplomatic stories, and New Zealand will have no choice but to participate.\n\nIt\u2019s a massive moment for The Spinoff right now, and we\u2019ve got some good news to share. We\u2019re hiring for not just one, but two new full-time senior journalism jobs, along with looking for journos who can do more casual shift-work. We\u2019re also looking for a full-time office manager. None of this would have been possible without the support of Spinoff Members, so thanks so much to all who have contributed. And if you\u2019re interested in applying, all the details can be found here.\n\nSo was the lockdown illegal? Right now, opinions are split, to say the least. Thomas Coughlan has reported on advice given to the government by the the solicitor-general, and obtained by Stuff, which argues that because of the widespread interference in human rights, it would only be lawful if justified by the health risks. The advice also argued that the government had to prove their measures were proportional. Attorney-general David Parker has since come out backing the legality of the lockdown on that basis.\n\nHaving said that, it is still likely to end up being tested. And on the aspect of whether or not the lockdown rules were actually enforceable in a legal sense, a story by Newstalk ZB\u2019s Barry Soper suggests they were not, particularly during the first iteration of the legal basis of the lockdown, which may have implications for the hundreds of people prosecuted under those rules. Who\u2019s right? As someone with no legal training I have no idea, but have no doubt that more learned folk will be working hard on this.\n\nAs for whether this all matters, I strongly encourage you to read this piece by Otago University\u2019s Andrew Geddis \u2013 and not just because he very generously quotes The Bulletin in it. To quote him right back:\n\n\u201cGiven that we\u2019re dealing with the use of powers contained in a piece of legislation more than six decades old, expressed in quite terse fashion, and exercised in the midst of an emergency situation, it\u2019s unsurprising that there\u2019s some uncertainty about their \u201ccorrect\u201d interpretation and application.\n\nHaving that debate involves no malice or unwarranted pedantry. Rather, it reflects a desire to get clarity about whether the claimed legal powers actually permit the very extensive actions that have been taken.\u201d\n\nA legal decision to deem a courier an employee could have big implications for the whole workforce, reports Stuff. It follows one courier\u2019s battle to not be considered an independent contractor \u2013 which is the model used by much of the industry. Being an employee brings with it a range of other benefits and legal protections. The judge made it clear in the case that the decision applied only to the courier in question \u2013 however, FIRST Union say it is a landmark one that should be noticed in all industries \u201cthat blur the boundaries between contractors and employees.\u201d\n\nWe got a lot more detail yesterday about the regime that will be in place when the country moves to alert level two. Here\u2019s a cheat sheet about all the things you will and still won\u2019t be able to do, including going back to the office, having a meal in a restaurant under strict conditions, and finally seeing other human beings outside of your bubble (no offence to my bubble, who are all great.) Incidentally, our live blog reported yesterday that legislation will be formally introduced to parliament next week that sets out the legal basis for level two restrictions. We\u2019ll find out on Monday afternoon if and when we\u2019ll be moving into it.\n\nThe vice-president of Young ACT has quit the organisation, after alleging that complaints of sexual harassment had been ignored. Stuff reports that several members have since been kicked out, and the youth wing\u2019s president has acknowledged that the organisation had failed, putting in place a range of actions in response. An independent inquiry into it is also being considered. The vice-president also alleged that there were other victims of similar treatment within Young ACT.\n\nIt seems like it\u2019s happening much sooner than normal given everything else going on, but the Budget will be unveiled next week. The NZ Herald (paywalled) has published a useful comment piece by tax expert Geof Nightingale, who has assessed the sort of spending that will take place, and the debt that will inevitably accrue as a result. So will that mean higher taxes are announced? Nightingale says that is unlikely, but at some stage tax revenue will be needed to pay that debt back. On that point, Newshub reports the PM repeatedly faced questions over whether new taxes would be introduced yesterday in parliament \u2013 Ardern didn\u2019t rule it out, and the pair had an exchange of views.\n\nThis story is almost worth reading for the brilliantly dry intro alone: Blasting a millions-of-years-old rock overhang in a national park wasn\u2019t a good idea, the Department of Conservation has found. The piece, by Newsroom\u2019s David Williams, concerns the decision last year to bring down a sandstone overhang in the Paparoa National Park, which has subsequently been criticised as prioritising tourists over nature. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a decision that is now a little too late to reverse.\n\nGot some feedback about The Bulletin, or anything in the news?

Photo: Getty\n\nRight now on The Spinoff: Historian Aroha Harris looks at the way M\u0101ori communities have mobilised in the past to protect themselves, echoed today in iwi-led checkpoints. Emily Writes has an important report on the abuse and dehumanisation that has been heaped on customer service workers during the pandemic. Jessie Moss writes about the learning journey of her kids outside of their normal classroom. A group of good brains from the New Zealand Alternative write about how this country can make use of the global acclaim being built up by our Covid-19 response. And Ryk Goddard, former Tasmanian, writes about how good it would be if the first international connection New Zealanders had would be to the best part of that country.\n\nFor a feature today, a look at some of the ways we might figure out the real time state of the economy. It comes from the blog Economics NZ, by economist Donal Curtin, and is an update to a series started last month which looks at a range of economic indicators. The standard ones like consumer spending are there, but the one that really piqued my interest was electricity generation \u2013 it dropped quite a bit lower than normal when we went into level four, and has stayed below normal levels ever since. For an excerpt, I\u2019ll take a section from the introductory post, in which Curtin explains why these measurements are useful:\n\nThe wider point about the limited range of our current official cyclical data, and the speed with which what we have gets published, needs to be addressed. You can\u2019t go to a competition or regulation conference these days without people blathering on about how \u2018big data\u2019 enables market power, or threatens privacy, but you don\u2019t see anything like the same focus on how the torrents of big data could be used to generate near-real-time cyclical gauges.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to have the business as usual, industrial strength, quality-assured things like the quarterly national accounts. But as Grant Robertson and the lads at Treasury \u2013 and the rest of us \u2013 are finding out, there\u2019s a big role for the cheap and cheerful but timely and informative indicators, too.\n\nThat\u2019s it for The Bulletin.
