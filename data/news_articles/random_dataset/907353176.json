Sanders has the highest number of fans among Norwegian MPs, most of them representing left-wing parties, but none in the right-wing Progress Party: eight of their MPs were the only ones to favour the incumbent Donald Trump.\n\nMost of those hoping Sanders will win in November represent the LabourParty and the Socialist Left (SV). Of all 169 MPs polled, only 29 said they had not decided on a particular favourite, but all 29 strongly hope Trump will be replaced.\n\n\u201cAnyone but Trump,\u201d exclaimed Labour\u2019s deputy leader Hadia Tajik, a former government minister who suggested that even a cat would be more suitable to run the White House than the current president: \u201cButtigieg\u2019s cat, Klobouchar\u2019s neighbour or Joe Biden\u2019s unknown cousin, for example. All of those are better suited,\u201d Tajik wrote in a text message to Klassekampen.\n\nEspen Barth Eide, a former minister of defense and foreign affairs for Labour, reckoned that tactics are more important than personal preference when Democrats choose their candidate. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, (they) must get someone who can actually beat Trump,\u201d Eide responded in the survey.\n\nThe results of the survey were published on the same day that newspaper Aftenposten carried an op-ed piece on some of Sanders\u2019 supporters known as Berniebros, likening their behaviour to Trump\u2019s bullying and threats, particularly on the digital frontlines.\n\nSanders and Buttigieg preferred\n\nOnly 15 of Norway\u2019s 169 MPs did not respond to Klassekampen\u2019s single question, \u201cWho is your preferred presidential candidate in the US?\u201d Of those responding, 36 did not want to give a direct answer, with some saying it would be inappropriate for a Norwegian parliamentarian to do so. Several others claimed to be undecided.\n\nFully 68 respondents, however, were willing to share their favourite. Of those, 29 said they favour Sanders while 20 would go for Pete Buttigieg.\n\nWithin the Labour party ranks, 16 out of 49 Labour preferred MPs Sanders. Five would like Joe Biden to win, three support Elizabeth Warren, while two prefer Pete Buttigieg.\n\nSanders has the support of 10 out of 11 delegates from the Socialist Left, including party leader Audun Lysbakken. Among the centrist parties, only a handful of representantives voiced a preference for Sanders, but some said he\u2019s \u201ca strong candidate.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Warren won support from seven MPs in five parties, including the lone representative of the Greens (MDG).\n\nLabour veteran Martin Kolberg suggested that Scandinavian-style social democracy is in line with Sanders\u2019 way of thinking. \u201cHe could represent what the US really needs,\u201d Kolberg told Klassekampen. \u201cThat\u2019s about protecting the democracy, but also a change of economic policies towards a more level and stable society.\u201d\n\nKolberg said he actually ran into Bernie Sanders while visiting Congress in 2018. \u201cHe came walking down a corridor and took time to talk when he heard who I was,\u201d Kolberg boasted. \u201cI got a very good impression (of him).\u201d\n\nSome of those declining to take part in the poll said they\u2019ll deal with whoever is the President of the United States. That pretty much echoes Norway\u2019s official line when members of government are asked about life with Donald Trump. Reacting to his 2016 election victory, however, Prime Minister Erna Solberg admitted that he had not been her first choice as president.\n\nProgress warms to Trump\n\nBefore the US\u2019 2016 election, just one Progress Party MP, Ulf Leirstein, openly supported Donald Trump. According to Klassekampen\u2019s survey, that number has now risen to eight, and includes the warm support of Progress\u2019 former Justice Minister Per-Willy Amundsen. He said he likes Trump\u2019s economic and foreign policies, and is \u201cimpressed\u201d with how he has handled China.\n\n\u201cWe should be careful in judging Trump\u2019s rhetoric and image from a European perspective,\u201d Amundsen said. \u201cThe US is much more than California and New York.\u201d\n\nOthers representing Norway\u2019s conservative parties said they used to support the US\u2019 Republican party, but that\u2019s not possible anymore with Trump as president.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, \u2018my\u2019 own party has been ruined,\u201d said MP Lene Westgaard-Halle of the Conservative Party (H\u00f8yre). \u201cI therefore have to choose a Democrat, and that would be Tom Steyer because of his approach to renewable energy and climate policies.\u201d\n\nFormer Transport Minister Jon Georg Dale, a more moderate member of the Progress Party, also said he would \u201cnormally find my favourites on the Republican side, but with today\u2019s president I have to consider other candidates.\u201d\n\nHalf of the Conservatives\u2019 20 representatives in Parliament who responded to the survey otherwise prefer Buttigieg. He also proved to have fans in almost all Norwegian parties across the political spectrum, from Labour and SV to the Liberals (Venstre), the Christian Democrats and the Center Party as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see the Democrats choose Buttigieg, \u201d MP Kent Gudmundsen of the Conservatives told Klassekampen. \u201cHe\u2019s a centrist, moderate candidate who looks to the Nordic region and European cooperation.\u201d\n\nnewsinenglish.no/Morten M\u00f8st"}}
