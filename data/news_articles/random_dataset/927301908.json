I am not an old styled politician. I represent a new direction of politics that is based on facts and truth not lies,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked on the claim that he betrayed his godfather who made him win the state governorship election, he said \u201cin life everybody gets helped, everybody gets assisted. The person talked about he had no money when he left labour to contest. We knew what we did to make him governor. I sacrificed eight years of my life pro bono, I collected no kobo to serve him in Edo.\n\n\u201cToday we know what we have built because of where we started from. So when you talk of betrayal, the biggest betrayal can be when people betray a cause, when they betray an idea. That is the greatest betrayal of all. It is like betraying God. When you say to God, this is what I stand for and then God gives you power then you turn around and do the exact opposite.\n\n\u201cThere is no greater betrayal than that. So when you talk about betrayal let us be very clear. I want to put it on record that I am grateful he assisted me just as I assisted him. I know the sacrifices we made to make him national chairman. So what are we talking about,\u201d he queried.\n\nOn the mode of primary election, he pointed out that the basis of every democracy is rules and that is the constitution of the party which stipulates the mode of primaries and how things should be done.\n\n\u201cThe constitution stipulates what mode of primaries to be allowed in our party and how decisions to the type of primaries you want to run should be arrived at. It is clearly stated in our constitution and so for me, I believe that our lawful party will do things according to the constitution.\n\n\u201cSo, I am certain that I will win the primaries but we have to respect our constitution and follow it.\n\n\u201cI prefer the indirect primary to direct primary because of COVID-19 which he said will reduce the gathering of more people in a place.\u201d"}}
