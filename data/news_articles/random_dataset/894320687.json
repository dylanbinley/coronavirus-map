Held at the plush Institute of Directors building on Pall Mall \u2014 right at the heart of London \u2014 the event was organized on the 100th anniversary of King Faisal\u2019s visit to Europe, and his presence at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in his capacity as a Saudi prince.\n\nIn a speech to the audience, Prince Turki \u2014 chairman of the board of directors of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies \u2014 said when King Faisal first visited the UK as a 13-year-old, he endured a \u201cquestionable\u201d reception, with administrative errors leaving him to find accommodation in a remote south London suburb. King George V personally intervened to bring the young prince closer to the city center.\n\nBut on the occasion of his last visit in 1967, Prince Turki said King Faisal received a 21-gun salute and was honored with a Trooping of the Color from the British Army\u2019s Household Cavalry \u2014 a significant state honor that is rarely performed to visitors.\n\n\n\nkeywords\n\nThis transformation in reception, Prince Turki said, was a testament to how well-liked King Faisal was by Queen Elizabeth.\n\nPrince Turki added that the exhibition was organized to deliver a message about King Faisal\u2019s legacy, and to promote his journey, ideas and personality to Europe and the whole world.\n\n\u201cThe lessons that King Faisal learned during his visit were highly important, especially with regards to education and industry, which he later applied in his vision to modernize the Kingdom, which made him one of the most prominent political figures of the century,\u201d Prince Turki said.\n\nHe thanked the exhibition\u2019s sponsors, including international media partner Arab News. Editor in Chief Faisal J. Abbas accepted the prince\u2019s thanks before the official opening.\n\nTracing the steps of #SaudiArabia's King Faisal on his historical tour to Europe at the age of 13, on behalf of his father, an exhibition devoted to commemorate the centenary of his trip organized by @KFCRIS in #London opened todayhttps://t.co/140pMEnyU8 pic.twitter.com/UwxLai9cSm \u2014 Arab News (@arabnews) December 20, 2019\n\n\u201cArab News was established in the era of the late King Faisal as an international voice of the Arabs,\u201d Abbas said.\n\n\u201cAs such, we are very proud to be the international media partner of this exhibition in London, and to play a part in re-telling the remarkable history of this truly remarkable king.\u201d\n\nThe event featured guests and dignitaries from around the world, including representatives from Saudi Arabia\u2019s friends and allies across the Middle East and Africa.\n\nSir Malcolm Rifkind, former UK foreign secretary, told Arab News that he was \u201cvery pleased to attend the exhibition\u201d following a career in the British government that featured several visits to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe exhibition details the life of King Faisal, and also the world he influenced and changed. His reign saw the fall of European empires and the rise of Saudi Arabia, and the displays showcase his role in the world\u2019s shifting powers.\n\nSome of his most important and treasured possessions are on display, including his diary, some manuscripts, letters, paintings and maps that detail a life of leadership and his global footprint.\n\nOne of the sections is dedicated to how King Faisal learned from his visits to the battlefields of Europe that war should be treated as a last resort. The displays included his steel spearheads from his fighting in the Saudi region of Asir.\n\nAnother section explores his trip to India, which was a major experience of travel beyond Saudi Arabia before his visit to London.\n\nOne of the attendees at the exhibition, a young Saudi woman studying for a Ph.D. at Imperial College London, told Arab News that she was \u201cinspired by King Faisal\u2019s experiences and his work in promoting education for girls and women.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cEngland, Wales and Ireland\u201d section of the exhibition features a ceremonial sabre that was exchanged when he met George V and his wife Queen Mary to demonstrate an \u201caffirmation of excellent relations.\u201d\n\nPrince Turki told Arab News that King Faisal \u201cappreciated the achievements of the British people.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cDuring his visit, the late king traveled around the UK, from Ireland, through the north and south of England, Wales, London and other cities. He got to know the people and appreciate their accomplishments.\u201d\n\nPrince Turki added: \u201cThe relationship between the two countries grew through to his final visit in 1967, where he was given a very distinguished reception by Queen Elizabeth, with the 21-gun salute and the Trooping of the Color.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cToday, the two kingdoms enjoy these very strong relationships, the first seeds of which were planted when King Faisal made his visit when he was 13 years old.\u201d"}}
