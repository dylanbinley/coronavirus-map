The looming crunch-time will have ramifications for livelihoods, businesses, pension pots and high streets. Debate about extending the moratorium is intensifying, as are calls for Government help.\n\n\u201cYou have a large accrued liability building up in the sector which is going to act either as an anchor on growth, or is going to make them go pop,\u201d warns Kate Nicholls, chief of the industry group UK Hospitality.\n\nNon-payment of commercial rent was an early sign of the financial pressures triggered by the lockdown, with retail landlords collecting by early April less than half of what they were owed on March 25. The Government\u2019s protections for tenants has brought relief for business owners, but also accusations from landlords that a minority of healthy tenants are using it as cover to hoard cash instead of pay their rent.\n\nFacing a growing pile of unresolved negotiations, ministers and industry introduced a voluntary code of practice in mid-June aimed at smoothing relations.\n\nIt stressed that tenants who could pay in full should do so, while landlords should support needy tenants where reasonably possible.\n\nMany landlords have been helping tenants, either by waiving or deferring rent or offering new fee structures, such as Regent Street landlord the Crown Estate which has offered to move to turnover-linked rent, giving tenants more protection during a downturn.\n\nBrian Bickell, chief executive of the FTSE 250 central London landlord Shaftesbury, says he expects to be supporting tenants until next year. \u201cWest End footfall will come back eventually, but we want to make sure they can survive post-Christmas,\u201d he says. \u201cLandlords have got to take some pain but give tenants a chance to pay back arrears over a reasonable period. Then everyone will be better off.\u201d\n\nYet there are also tales of landlords demanding lengthier leases or personal guarantees in return for rent cuts, and a huge pile of unresolved cases. A July survey of UK Hospitality\u2019s members found that 58pc of respondents had not yet reached agreements with landlords, while a similar exercise by the British Independent Retailers Association (Bira) found that 30pc of respondents\u2019 landlords had declined to offer help.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the looming end of the evictions moratorium raises alarm. \u201cThere is a real concern that there is a ticking time bomb on rentals,\u201d says Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of Bira. \u201cI think September could be very very difficult if we don\u2019t find a better solution than a free for all and letting the market play out. You could be looking at one in five independent retailers having to close.\u201d\n\nThe British Retail Consortium trade group and others believe the moratorium should be extended, unless other supportive measures are put in place. \u201cWithout action, the job losses we have seen across the industry over the last month will be the tip of the iceberg,\u201d argues the BRC\u2019s head Helen Dickinson.\n\nThat is anathema to many landlords, who are concerned about being taken for a ride by a minority of tenants, and frustrated at the restrictions. \u201cI can understand the Government had to step in in the middle of the pandemic,\u201d says David Atkins, outgoing chief of shopping centre owner Hammerson, speaking to The Telegraph at interim results earlier this month."}}
