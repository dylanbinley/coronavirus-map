Because supply will be limited at first, the LNG will be sold on contract-only basis to trucking companies, and \"a significant portion\" of production is already spoken for.\n\nThat may, or may not, still be the case by the time more LNG pumps are rolled out on routes between other major cities.\n\nRenergen, which operates gas wells near Virginia in the Free State, announced the resale deal with Total South Africa this week. It will come into operation as soon as the first phase of Renergen's LNG plant starts churning out LNG.\n\nThanks to the composition of the gas in its wells, the only onshore petroleum production site in South Africa, Renergen could end up as a significant global supplier of helium. The strategic value of that helium has attracted interest, and investment, from the likes of the United States government.\n\nSee also: The US government just invested R600 million into a gas project in the Free State that promises to reduce the global shortage of helium\n\nGet the best of our site emailed to you daily: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:"}}
