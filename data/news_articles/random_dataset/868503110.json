He participated in every fundraiser, every capital campaign and anything he was asked to do he did happily, willingly and enthusiastically,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nGram\u2019s community involvement went beyond what most people can make time for, which earned him the title of a community leader in Gainesville and Hall County. According to a memorial page posted on the Whelchel, Dunlap, Jarrard and Walker\u2019s directory, Gram made his mark as:\n\nPast president and long-time board member at the Boys & Girls Club of Hall County\n\nPast president and long-time board member at Challenged Child and Friends\n\nLong-time board member and general counsel (pro bono) at Good News Clinic\n\nSalvation Army advisory board\n\nElachee Nature Science Center advisory board\n\nPast president and long-time board member at North Georgia Community Foundation\n\nFounding board member and long-time supporter at Georgia Mountain Food Bank\n\nGram received a number of awards \u201crecognizing his commitment to and impact on his community.\u201d He received the Justice Benham Community Service Award for his service on a statewide level.\n\n\u201cI think that philanthropy was really a core value for John,\u201d Michelle Prater, the president and CEO at North Georgia Community Foundation, said. \u201cFor him to be so involved and involved in so many ways, I do believe his legacy and the impact of his legacy will be living throughout the community for many years to come.\u201d\n\nAs president and chairman of the board at North Georgia Community Foundation, Gram helped the organization promote and raise awareness, helped clients with charitable giving, built strategies and provided governance for the organization, Prater said.\n\nThe North Georgia Community Foundation\u2019s mission is to improve lives in 15-counties of northeast Georgia by helping people invest in organizations and causes, build strong non-profits and identify local issues and opportunities for change.\n\n\u201cHe was really one of the leading forces that helped grow our organization,\u201d Prater said.\n\nGram had similar duties at Georgia Mountain Food Bank, but he saw a vision he wanted to help make a reality, Kay Blackstock, the executive director at the food bank, said.\n\nGeorgia Mountain Food Bank addresses hunger, health and food insecurity in Dawson, Forsyth, Hall, Lumpkin and Union counties. The organization identifies themselves as \u201cthe vital link between sources of food supplies and hardworking community-based partner agencies who help get the food into the hands of families and individuals in need.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis heart was in it from the beginning,\u201d Blackstock said. \u201cHe just wanted to be a part of this effort, albeit very grass roots, the concept of the organization wasn\u2019t really known during the worst economy since the depression. You had to be pretty brave to sign up for that,\u201d she said.\n\nThe food bank launched at the end of 2008.\n\nAside from his community involvement, Gram had another passion\u2014running. He ran in local races nearly every weekend, his dear friend and vice president of marketing and development at North Georgia Community Foundation, Megan Martin said.\n\nMartin and Gram built a relationship both professionally and personally over the last 12 years, for they shared similar interests. It was a short while in Gram\u2019s 74 years, but a big chunk of Martin\u2019s life, she said.\n\n\u201cWe kept running into each other, like, literally running into each other\u2026He ran almost every Saturday and it wasn\u2019t even about where the race was sometimes, but about where they were going to have a good breakfast afterwards,\u201d Martin said.\n\nGram's favorite spot to chow-down at was 2 Dog Restaurant near downtown Gainesville. He enjoyed eating his lunch outside while sitting on the patio, Martin said.\n\n\u201cHe was there pretty much any time he was gone for lunch, so Mondays were always difficult for him, because he didn\u2019t know where to go,\u201d Martin said.\n\nWhile Gram has left behind a legacy of being an astounding community leader, he will be remembered by his law firm for his laugh and personality.\n\n\u201cHe had a very infectious laugh and was always upbeat,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cHe found the humor in everything\u2026And he loved his family.\u201d\n\nGram will be remembered by his friends for his advice and encouragement.\n\n\u201cHe always believed. So, it\u2019s the advice that \u2018you can do that.\u2019 Whether it was about running or it was about life or a dream I had and wanted to pursue, he never doubted. He always encouraged and believed I could do anything,\u201d Martin said.\n\nHe will be remembered by his long-time business partners for his ear-to-ear smile and authenticity.\n\n\u201cHe was just the best guy,\u201d Blackstock said. \u201cHe was a genuine guy and had a killer smile. John was always kind, smiling and seemed happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis laugh just lit up a room and he made anyone feel welcome who was near him,\u201d Prater said.\n\nAnd he will be remembered by his clients as the smart guy who saved the day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been getting a lot of emails [from his clients], and one said he was a superhero, he was brilliant, which is one thing I have heard over and over, and that he was just a great person,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nGram\u2019s arrangements will be held under Memorial Park Funeral Home but have yet to be announced. A formal obituary written by his family will follow. Gram passed on Sunday, August 25, 2019. He was 74 years old, born on July 4, 1945."}}
