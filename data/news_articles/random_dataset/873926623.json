Saudi Arabia displayed wreckage of missiles and drones trying to prove that the weapons used were Iranian.\n\nOther senior Iranian officials have also argued that the weapons were made by Yemenis.\n\nImmediately after the surprise attack the U.S. and later Saudi Arabia insisted the attack had not come from Yemen, as Houthis had claimed, but originated from the north. Om Thursday, CBS News quoted an unnamed U.S. official who said the weapons were fired form southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz.\n\nSince the start of the war in Yemen in 2015 there have been many reports and claims that Houthi forces were using sophisticated Iranian weapons."}}
