He has broken a deal reached with the European Union in 2016 to close its border with Europe to stem the flood of immigrants from the Middle East. He took Europe\u2019s money that was part of the deal but is now reopening his country\u2019s border with Greece to extort more concessions. \u201cWe will continue the current measure on our frontiers until all of our expectations are concretely met,\u201d Erdogan said recently.\n\nWhen Greece pushed back to protect its border from the invasion, Erdogan lashed out. \u201cThere is no difference with what the Nazis did and the images from the border,\u201d he declared as he made unproven claims of \u201cbarbaric\u201d tactics supposedly used by Greek border guards.\n\nAs Breitbart pointed out, \u201cThe slur against Greece is notable, as some 300,000 people were killed during the 1941 Nazi occupation of the country, which near-wiped out Greece\u2019s Jewish population.\u201d Then again, we should not be surprised. Erdogan is an avowed anti-Semite who has indulged in conspiracy theories blaming Jews for the world\u2019s problems.\n\n\u201cGreece does not accept lessons in human rights and the respect of international law from the Turkish president,\u201d said a spokesman for the Greek government. He claimed that Ankara\u2019s actions were aimed at destabilizing Greece.\n\nThere are now an estimated 35,000 immigrants who are congregated along Turkey\u2019s border with Greece. Erdogan deployed at least 1,000 heavily armed special police to the border area last week to counter Greece\u2019s resistance to the immigrants\u2019 entry across the border into Greece. Turkish fighter jets have been recently sighted in the region, fueling tensions between the two NATO members who have had a long history of hostilities that Erdogan appears intent on escalating. Erdogan has vowed that \u201cTurkish naval patrols would go on harassing Greek patrol vessels at sea,\u201d according to The Guardian, following an incident in the Aegean Sea last week. Another Turkish-instigated flare-up at sea occurred on Wednesday.\n\nGreece\u2019s Prime Minister, Kyri\u00e1kos Mitsot\u00e1kis, accused Turkey of becoming \u201cthe official trafficker of migrants to the European Union.\u201d He said that Turkey is using \u201cdesperate people\u201d to promote its \u201cgeopolitical agenda.\u201d\n\nThe current EU Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, praised Greece\u2019s defensive actions at its border. \u201cThis border is not only a Greek border, it is also a European border,\u201d she said. \u201cI thank Greece for being our European aspida [shield] in these times.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Mitsot\u00e1kis has charged that the thousands of Syrian refugees trying recently to enter Greece have not come from the current Syrian hotspot of Idlib in northwest Syria, where Turkey has contributed to the violence. Instead, they had been \u201cliving safely in Turkey for a long period of time.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, has acknowledged that few, if any, of those recently arriving at Greece\u2019s doorstep are in fact from northwest Syria. His observation would appear to back up Prime Minister Mitsot\u00e1kis\u2019s charge. Yet, Mr. Grandi\u2019s refugee agency is leaning on Greece to allow self-declared \u201crefugees\u201d originally from Syria who have entered Greece\u2019s territory \u201cirregularly\u201d to present themselves without delay to the authorities to seek asylum.\n\n\"Continued European resources, capacity and solidarity are needed to boost Greece\u2019s response,\"\n\nthe agency suggests. At the same time, \u201cinternational support to Turkey,\u201d the UN agency declares, \u201cmust be sustained and stepped up.\u201d But does that mean that Turkey should be able to renege on its deal and export thousands of its current Syrian residents to Europe? Apparently, so.\n\nThe truth is that there will never enough to satisfy Erdogan, the deal breaker. And it is highly doubtful that he would use the bulk of increased financial support to help with the housing and education of Syrian refugees already living in Turkey. He has his military interventions in Syria and Libya to finance.\n\nAlthough there are some indications that the EU may bow to Erdogan\u2019s pressure campaign by offering him more money, Erdogan is upping the ante. He is insisting on a resumption of talks about Turkey joining the EU. That\u2019s a hard sell given Turkey\u2019s dramatic move towards authoritarianism under Erdogan\u2019s rule. Expect Erdogan to continue his confrontation with Greece and the EU until they bend to accommodate his wishes one way or the other.\n\n* * *\n\nPhoto from Pixabay"}}
