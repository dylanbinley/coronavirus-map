People at farmers\u2019 markets generally aren\u2019t as in a big of a rush \u2026 they\u2019re there to discover all of the great fresh food, home cooking, canned goods and arts and crafts on display. And of course, being able to sample some great food. Farmers\u2019 markets also provide that rare opportunity to connect with the farmers themselves, who can share knowledge ranging from how produce is grown, to nutritional values, to offering advice on how to prepare the food.\n\nSo it\u2019s a relatively inexpensive, fun, family-friendly experience. And particularly for those living in urban areas, an opportunity to reconnect ourselves and our kids with our farmers, our farmland \u2013 which has been threatened for years by urban sprawl, and our appreciation of food, and where it comes from.\n\nThe challenge with the majority of kids growing up in an urban setting these days is they\u2019ve never been to a farm. And due to a combination of factors, ranging from our obsession with convenience to our addiction to fast food, home-cooked meals and the use of locally sourced produce has become increasingly rare.\n\nCatherine Clark, executive director of Farmers\u2019 Markets of Ontario, concurs. \u201cThe biggest problem is people don\u2019t know how to cook,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can buy squash, but how do you prepare it if you haven\u2019t been raised on squash soup or potato soup or things like that? (Instead) it\u2019s all frozen \u2018fresh stuff\u2019."}}
