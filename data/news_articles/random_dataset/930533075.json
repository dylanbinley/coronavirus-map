Until then, our investigations will move forward without delay or interruption.\"\n\nBerman, a Republican who contributed to the Trump's election campaign, worked for the same law firm as Giuliani and was put in his job by the Trump administration.\n\n5 Attorney General William Barr announced the resignation in a statement late on Friday Credit: The Mega Agency\n\n5 Berman's refusal to leave his position sets up a potential crisis in the Justice Department Credit: Getty Images - Getty\n\nAs a US attorney, however, Berman won over some skeptics when he went after Trump allies.\n\nBerman's office took an aggressive approach in a number of cases tied to that frustrated the Trump administration \u2013 including guilty pleas obtained from Michael Cohen, Trump's long-time fixer, who was sent to prison.\n\nBerman recused himself from directly overseeing the investigation of Cohen for reasons that were never disclosed.\n\nTensions between the New York and Washington offices also grown, with Berman and Barr clashing over the handling of some cases, including the indictment of Turkish bank Halkbank.\n\nTrump, too, has been angered by a series of investigations that Berman has been involved in.\n\nAGGRESSIVE INVESTIGATIONS\n\nHis office subpoenaed Trump's inaugural committee for a wide range of financial and other documents as part of an investigation into potential crimes \u2013 including possible illegal contributions from foreigners.\n\nWeeks before the 2018 midterm election, Berman also announced insider trading charges against an ardent Trump supporter, Republican Rep. Chris Collins, who has since resigned.\n\nOver the last year, his office also brought indictments against two close associates of the president's lawyer, Rudi Giuliani.\n\nAn investigation into Giuliani himself also began, focusing on his efforts to dig up dirt on the president's political rivals in Ukraine, and whether these could have violated laws on lobbying from foreign entities.\n\nMOST READ IN US NEWS SICKENING 'MURDER' Court docs reveal boy was 'sexually abused by dad after soiling pants' VIOLENT CLASH Huge brawl erupts as Proud Boys & Antifa fight with bats & mace in Portland ABUSE OF TRUST Teacher 'forced student to have sex in classroom and send explicit photos' 'HE'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN' Husband paralyzed by stray bullet in NYC while walking with wife Exclusive 'SO BRUTAL' Daisy Coleman killed herself 'after learning rape left her unable to have kids' 'YOU'VE NOW GOT COVID' Police hunt masked suspect who gave Walmart shoppers \u2018COVID hugs\u2019\n\nBerman's office also brought charges against Michael Avenatti, the lawyer who represented porn actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits involving Trump.\n\nAvenatti was convicted earlier this year of trying to extort sportswear giant Nike after prosecutors said he threatened to use his media access to hurt Nike's reputation and stock price.\n\nThe Southern District of New York also requested testimony from Britain's Prince Andrew, as part of a criminal investigation into the alleged co-conspirators of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to reports.\n\n5 Berman's office began investigating Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani over his efforts to dig up dirt in Ukraine on the president's rivals Credit: AFP - Getty\n\n5 Berman won over some skeptics after he went after Trump allies Credit: CNP"}}
