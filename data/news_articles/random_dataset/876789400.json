It also sent a letter to Semyon \u201cSam\u201d Kislin, a New York businessmen and former campaign supporter of Giuliani who reportedly been associated with organized crime.\n\nThe letters call on the four men to preserve a wide array of documents related to Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine efforts, as well as any potential involvement by the Trump administration in this scheme.\n\n\u201cA growing public record, including your of statements, indicates that the President, you, and others appear to have pressed the Ukrainian government to pursue two politically-motivated investigations,\u201d the letter sent to Giuliani said.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s three alleged associates are required to give depositions within the next two weeks, warning them that Congress could otherwise \u201cpursue alternative means to obtain the information.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena, including at the direction or behest of the president or the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the president,\u201d all four letters warned.\n\nThe House demanded records related to a US$325,000 donation made in the name of a company belonging to Parnas and Fruman in May 2018 to a pro-Trump Super PAC, America First Action. The transaction was covered in OCCRP and BuzzFeed News\u2019 July report.\n\nThe letters also demanded information on a meeting involving former Congressman Pete Sessions that same month, an apparent reference to an event first revealed in OCCRP\u2019s July report, in which Parnas and Fruman urged Sessions to dismiss the US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nIn a phone interview on Monday evening, Kislin said he would appear before the House.\n\nKislin said he did not know Parnas, but that he knew Fruman, who owned a hotel in Odessa and that he had seen him nearly a decade ago.\n\n\u201c[Fruman] knows Giuliani. I know Giuliani too because I used to work for Giuliani. I used to be economical director,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey came to my lawyer a few days [ago], they asked for me. They\u2019re fishing. You know the word, \u2018fishing\u2019?\u201d"}}
