It\u2019s a film about water, the role water plays in climates around the world, and how changes in those climates can unleash water\u2019s destructive power.\n\nBut none of those themes are narrated in the film. Instead, we\u2019re presented with about 90 minutes of lengthy scenes and trusted to draw meaning from them \u2014 cars falling through melting ice that used to be solid enough to drive across; rolling high seas; icebergs splitting apart; gale-force storms on highways; enormous, breathtaking waterfalls. Watching Aquarela is less like watching a traditional nature documentary and more like a feature-length music video that roams the globe, without many people onscreen, and no talking heads or explanatory text. Water, in its many forms, is the protagonist, rather than the subject. It\u2019s the sort of film that leaves you in awe.\n\nThe unpredictable natural environments that appear in the film made shooting it a dangerous challenge, meaning Aquarela is likely one of the riskiest documentaries ever made. And in case its implications aren\u2019t obvious, Kossakovsky tapped the Finnish symphonic metal band Apocalyptica to compose the film\u2019s score.\n\nThe director, who grew up in the Soviet Union and often makes experimental films, also shot Aquarela at 96 frames per second \u2014 much higher than most films\u2019 24 frames per second. His footage captures nearly every micro movement, making the images onscreen seem almost alive, crisp and vivid in a way that\u2019s difficult to explain. (Most movie theaters are not equipped to show the film at 96 fps, but many are projecting it in 48 fps, still faster than the standard frame rate.) The experience of watching it is both magnificent and unnerving.\n\nI recently met with Kossakovsky in New York to talk about Aquarela, his philosophy around documentaries, and the challenges of making a movie about water. Our conversation, edited and condensed for length and clarity, follows.\n\nAlissa Wilkinson\n\nWhy did you want to make a movie about water?\n\nVictor Kossakovsky\n\nIt\u2019s a simple question!\n\nAlissa Wilkinson\n\nWell, there\u2019s no more simple substance than water!\n\nVictor Kossakovsky\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nAs an artist, you\u2019re always looking for some creature or character which is ambivalent \u2014 beautiful, ugly, horrible, sweet in one second. Any fiction director is looking for such a character. But when you\u2019re not using actors, what could this be? Something that\u2019s surely always changing emotion, right?\n\nWell, there\u2019s nothing better than water [for that]. It\u2019s the perfect subject. Everyone talks about it like they understand it, but I think no one understands it. And the more you study, the more questions there are.\n\nWater challenges you every day. We\u2019re trying to spoil it in many ways. But it\u2019s still here. Still alive. It\u2019s everything.\n\nThis is the challenge: to make [a film] in a way you can\u2019t forget it. I\u2019m trying to film it in a way that you will sleep and you will see these waves; you will still have them in your mind. This for me is the challenge: to be realist and magical.\n\nAlissa Wilkinson\n\nHave you heard of 4DX cinema?\n\nVictor Kossakovsky\n\nAh, yeah, yeah.\n\nAlissa Wilkinson\n\nI had to see a movie in 4DX for an article. There\u2019s an element they call \u201cface water,\u201d where they spray water at you during the movie when it\u2019s onscreen.\n\nVictor Kossakovsky\n\nYeah, as they zoom the chair around.\n\nAlissa Wilkinson\n\nRight. I kept thinking about that experience while I was watching Aquarela, wondering what it would be like in 4DX. All the water!\n\nVictor Kossakovsky\n\nAnd suddenly the roof falls in!\n\nAlissa Wilkinson\n\nRight! But even though Aquarela is not in 4DX, it\u2019s almost as immersive. I kept thinking that it\u2019s a very big film. It\u2019s hard to find another word. The images look different because of the frame rate you\u2019re shooting at, there\u2019s heavy metal music, there\u2019s danger and risk \u2014 it\u2019s not a typical documentary.\n\nVictor Kossakovsky\n\nNo. People put the documentary in a corner, which I cannot take anymore. I cannot say, \u201cOh, well, it\u2019s a documentary \u2014 let\u2019s show it in a small cinema somewhere.\u201d We have red carpets for \u201cbig\u201d movies, and the documentaries have what?\n\nPeople think documentary is talking heads. Of course, I could have filmed 10 faces talking, politicians, environmentalists, and climatologists, and \u201cgreen\u201d people, talking: \u201cWell, we need water, save water, global warming.\u201d Of course, I can do it [that way]. But does it work? It doesn\u2019t work, right? Cinema is cinema.\n\nYou know what? In Russian, we don\u2019t say \u201cdocumentary.\u201d We say documentally. If literally translated, it\u2019s something about mentality. It\u2019s a document of mentality, of our way of seeing the world.\n\nPeople who think it\u2019s about talking heads ... if they want to make a documentary that way, they can do it. I\u2019m trying to make films about how we see the world. It\u2019s documentally. I\u2019m a warrior of cinema, so I want documentally to be considered like fiction, to be in the same \u201croom\u201d as fiction.\n\nAlissa Wilkinson\n\nPeople have been trained to watch one kind of documentary, as you say, and so they really don\u2019t know what to do when they encounter a movie like yours, that tries to depict reality but with these big, brash cinematic techniques. But why don\u2019t more people try to do what you\u2019re doing?\n\nVictor Kossakovsky\n\nIt\u2019s a question of motivation. Mostly people [start making] documentaries because they are nice people. They care. They want to say something, they want to help someone, they want to raise questions. All nice things to do.\n\nBut the best films in history say nothing important. The best paintings in history \u2014 Mona Lisa says nothing about the political situation in Italy at the time, in Europe, right? Even the best film ever done, [Dziga Vertov\u2019s 1929 silent film] Man With a Movie Camera, doesn\u2019t say anything about the Soviet Union or the Communist Party. Still the best film in history, not accidentally, because it has something more than we can understand. Art is what we can\u2019t understand. It contains things we can understand, but it also has something we can\u2019t understand. You\u2019re just watching something, and you cry, and you don\u2019t know why. If you are asked why you\u2019re crying, you can\u2019t answer. It\u2019s more than you can explain.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, we were raised in a way in which we could not say many things; we needed to find a visual way to express the ideas, a poetic way. If a poem said, \u201cThis president is an asshole\u201d \u2014 poets would not say it. Poets will write in a way that you will read between the lines, and it will suddenly become clear that he is an asshole: Fuck, he\u2019s an asshole! How can we elect him? I\u2019m not talking about your country. [smiles] There are many countries on the planet.\n\nArt is endless, ageless. It never dies. Ideas have died. Even Archimedes\u2019s ideas, Aristotle\u2019s ideas, Newton\u2019s ideas \u2014 they die or are changed. But the miracle of inspiration means art stays around. Art still makes us cry. And we still share it with each other.\n\nAlissa Wilkinson\n\nOne of the wildest things about watching this movie is that you\u2019re shooting right on the ocean, and because of the way you\u2019re shooting it, the waves and the water seem very alive in a way we almost never see them onscreen.\n\nVictor Kossakovsky\n\nYeah. Usually the ocean is \u201cmade\u201d in studios, you know? That\u2019s how they do that.\n\nAlissa Wilkinson\n\nAquarela is definitely not made in a studio.\n\nVictor Kossakovsky\n\nThis is not a studio. And most important: The camera is not moving. This is the most challenging. To film there [on the ocean], and to make the horizon still. Only my team can do this. [Kossakovsky and his team used special equipment to shoot on the open seas and keep the camera steady.]\n\nAlissa Wilkinson\n\nIt seems very dangerous! Were you worried?\n\nVictor Kossakovsky\n\nYes. Right from the start, in the scene with the car, we are filming this beautiful water, and suddenly, bam, the water gave a sign that it\u2019s beautiful, but it\u2019s not a joke. [In an early scene, a car suddenly falls through the ice it\u2019s driving on, which has melted several weeks earlier than expected.] It\u2019s beautiful, but it\u2019s not a joke. It\u2019s serious. And for a moment, we were like, maybe we shouldn\u2019t continue? Obviously, it\u2019s not a game. It\u2019s a real life-and-death challenge.\n\nSo every morning, first, I planned for safety. Who must stay where, and what we will do so that no one dies.\n\nYou need to understand that I\u2019m really happy with my own work. After [many projects I\u2019ve done], I said, \u201cThis planet is amazing. This life is just bliss. If I die, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\nBut my team is very young. That\u2019s why for me, [safety] was the biggest thing \u2014 to keep them alive. I have to be sure nothing happens to them.\n\nOn the boat, we were roped together, like one line. Because even to move from the left corner of the boat to the right corner, you need a few hours. Three, four, five hours sometimes, just to move from here to there. Always someone must watch you, and you must not lose contact. Because if something happened to you, you have a few seconds under [the water], and then you\u2019re gone. So you can do this only with people you really, really, really trust.\n\nAquarela is now playing in select theaters."}}
