Some ruptured their uterus because nobody was there to monitor them, so when interventions were made it was to save the mother,\" one of the doctors said, declining to be identified because they are not allowed to speak to the press.\n\nAnother doctor said fresh stillbirths - meaning a baby that dies during labour or delivery - were just a window into the state of Zimbabwe's public hospitals, which had become \"dysfunctional and a death trap to citizens\".\n\nExpecting mothers are spending hours sleeping on benches or the floor in the cold before they are attended to, as smaller clinics which usually absorb some patients are closed due to the strike, piling pressure on major hospitals, doctors said.\n\nThe Zimbabwe's Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said the situation in hospitals was \"beyond dire\".\n\n\"Simply put, unborn children and mothers are dying daily, or suffering from the repercussions of inadequate care,\" the organisation said in a statement.\n\nThe situation could worsen as an ultimatum for higher pay issued by senior doctors expires on Wednesday without a resolution. The doctors have said they will go on strike.\n\nCommenting on the stillbirths, President Emmerson Mnangagwa's spokesman George Charamba wrote on Twitter; \"When the true story gets known, many shall be shocked. There is a limit to what can be done with human lives, tender ones at that, all to mobilize for dead political ends!\"\n\nHe could not be reached for further comment.\n\nActing Health Minister Amon Murwira did not answer calls to his mobile phone.\n\n(Reporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo and Alexandra Hudson)\n\nVideo: As school decision approaches, doctors urge kids to get vaccinated (KARE-TV Minneapolis-St. Paul)"}}
