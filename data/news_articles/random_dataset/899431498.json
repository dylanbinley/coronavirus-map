I don\u2019t expect that there will be a further referendum in Scotland in the 2020s. That was the politics of the last decade.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Mr Ross told BBC Radio Scotland that \u201ca generation is normally, I think, 30, 40 or 50 years \u2014 it is stipulated around about that level\u201d.\n\nAt Prime Minister\u2019s Questions yesterday, Mr Johnson\u2019s flat rejection of the section 30 request was raised by Mr Blackford.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe prime minister sent a letter to the first minister of Scotland rejecting the democratic right of the people of Scotland to have a choice over their own future.\n\n\u201cThis was not a surprise, the prime minister is a democracy denier. Can I say to the prime minister, as his colleagues privately admit, this position is undemocratic, unacceptable and completely unsustainable.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cDoes the prime minister accept that by ignoring Scotland, imposing Brexit with his pursuance of cruel and punishing policies, that he\u2019s strengthening the case for Scottish independence?\u201d\n\nBut Mr Johnson claimed it was the SNP leadership who were denying democracy.\n\nThe prime minister said: \u201cIt was not only the honourable gentleman who leads the SNP in this House, it was also Alex Salmond and his protege Nicola Sturgeon who said at the time of the referendum that it was a once-in-a-generation event. He said it, they said it, they were right then, why have they changed their mind? He is the denier, he is the denier of democracy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile SNP Constitutional Relations Secretary Michael Russell claimed there were \u201cmany options\u201d for the Scottish Government to push for another independence vote, although he declined to go into them.\n\nMs Sturgeon has not ruled out taking legal action in an attempt to win the right to hold a vote."}}
