Elevated on pillars atop a sand dune, the beachfront home overlooks the Caribbean Sea on one side and a large lagoon and mangrove forest on the other.\n\nThe 1.5-acre property is about three miles from the entrance of Sian Ka\u2019an, along an unpaved road marked by a Mayan arch. There are no power lines in the 1.3 million-acre reserve; instead, the house is powered by solar and wind, and has a backup generator, said Sara Plaga, a luxury property specialist with Riviera Maya Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, which has the listing. All homes there must be built from natural materials, and there are restrictions on what residents and visitors may bring in to the area, including certain pets.\n\nBuilt in 2005, the 3,282-square-foot, cement house was inspired by Mayan architecture, with a traditional palapa roof with two peaks rising above the tree line. Palapa roofs, made from dried palm leaves, are effective for keeping interiors cool, and this one was built with wind vents to make it storm resistant, Ms. Plaga said.\n\n\u201cEvery year, you have these amazing guys with the knowledge of how to build these roofs come and maintain it, so there\u2019s no water leakage and there\u2019s no sun passing through,\u201d she said."}}
