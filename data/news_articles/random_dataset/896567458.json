Cole said he played the recording for social service investigators.\n\nIn the recording, you hear very blunt language from the woman who Cole said was sent to protect his two young children.\n\nCole said the proposition started soon after the social worker came to his home in Cramerton. He said she watched him carefully and then made a stunning request.\n\n\u201c\u2018If I close your case out, would you be willing to date me?'\u201d Cole said the social worker asked him.\n\nCole said he had a girlfriend, but he immediately began to worry that if he didn\u2019t agree on the date, someone might take his 3- and 4-year-old children.\n\n\u201cHave this relationship with her or lose my kids,\u201d Cole said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to deal with. I lost a lot of sleep behind that.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very inappropriate, you know,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI\u2019m scared for my life, scared for my children\u2019s welfare, my welfare.\u201d\n\nRead the full article at WSOC Channel 9\n\nComment on this article at MedicalKidnap.com.\n\nMedical Kidnapping: A Threat to Every Family in America T-Shirt\n\n100% Pre-shrunk Cotton!\n\nOrder here!\n\nMedical Kidnapping is REAL!\n\nSee: Medical Kidnapping: A Threat to Every Family in America Today\n\nHelp spread the awareness of Medical Kidnapping by wearing the Medical Kidnapping t-shirt!\n\nSupport the cause of MedicalKidnap.com, which is part of the Health Impact News network.\n\nOrder here!\n\nSupport the cause against Medical Kidnapping by purchasing our new book!\n\nIf you know people who are skeptical and cannot believe that medical kidnapping happens in the U.S. today, this is the book for them!
