But alas, our hopes and dreams were dashed when Jesse \u201cThe Body\u201d Ventura announced new wouldn\u2019t be seeking the Green Party\u2019s nomination, according to some since-deleted tweets from would-be campaign manager Bill Cimbrelo.\n\nNow we\u2019ll be forced to choose between a senile old rapist with a long history of racism and a senile old rapist with a long history of racism in a different colored hat. Maybe I can vote for a Ralph Nader again.\n\nVentura is a former WWE Superstar from the days when they were still called WWF wrestlers. He might be one of the most important people in the industry because he was the first person to have the idea of being a \u201cheel\u201d commentator, that is someone who roots for the bad guys. Bobby Heenan and Jerry Lawler followed in his footsteps and it\u2019s been one of wrestling\u2019s most successful aspects.\n\nHe\u2019s also the former governor of Minnesota as a member of the Reform Party, the only member of that party to win a major political office.\n\nAnd he has good politics, something increasingly rare.\n\napparently this man, @GovJVentura, is considering jumping into the 2020 presidential race LETS FUCKIN GOOOOO pic.twitter.com/YWXPg1nE5n \u2014 shoe (@shoe0nhead) May 4, 2020\n\nJesse Ventura standing his ground on the laws of torture to Elizabeth Hasslebeck on the View is the world I want to live in all the time.#RunJesseRun#JesseVentura2020 pic.twitter.com/FT7OXytj28 \u2014 #CancelRent Courtney (@CourtneyBanks) May 4, 2020\n\nYou don\u2019t expect to hear a lot of \u201cGee, what\u2019s wrong with a little waterboarding anyone\u201d from hosts from The View.\n\nIt would have been nice to have someone running for President with some integrity and a strong moral center, but it\u2019s been over 200 years, why start now?"}}
