Scripps Company have been selected as 2020 Report for America newsrooms and will host journalists to cover critically important beats in their communities as part of Scripps\u2019 enterprise journalism content strategy.\n\nReport for America (RFA), an initiative of nonprofit media organization The GroundTruth Project, is a national service program that recruits and trains talented young journalists and places them in local newsrooms to cover under-reported topics in markets across the country.\n\n\u201cA central tenet of our content strategy at Scripps is our effort to focus more reporting on the beats and topics that impact the audiences we serve, including more coverage of underserved communities,\u201d said Sean McLaughlin, vice president of news for Local Media at Scripps. \u201cThe journalists we hire into our newsrooms through the Report for America program will help us expand our commitment to enterprise reporting on critical issues and to be more inclusive about how we represent what is news in our markets.\u201d\n\nScripps leads other local broadcasting groups by number of local TV stations selected to participate in RFA\u2019s 2020-2021 program, which also includes daily and non-daily newspapers, digital-only sites and public radio stations. RFA plans to place 250 journalists in local communities across 46 states in 2020.\n\nLeaders in the Scripps stations will mentor the journalists \u2013 who are paid and serve for one or two years \u2013 on all aspects of newsgathering for a local TV station while focusing their reporting on beats that are critically important to audiences in each community.\n\nThe RFA journalist placed with Scripps\u2019 Montana Television Network (MTN) stations \u2013 comprised of the NBC affiliate in Helena and CBS affiliates in Billings, Bozeman, Butte, Great Falls, Helena, and Missoula \u2013 will travel to Montana\u2019s Native American reservations to give these traditionally underserved communities a larger voice and more empowering coverage.\n\nThe RFA journalist placed with WCPO in Cincinnati will cover the city\u2019s urban redevelopment efforts and the impact those efforts have had on low-income and minority residents.\n\nWEWS in Cleveland will report on literacy, domestic abuse and other important issues traditionally under-reported in the Northeast Ohio region.\n\nThe RFA journalist serving at KIVI in Boise, Idaho, will cover issues affecting underserved populations in rural areas, including immigration and climate change.\n\nWTMJ in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, will embed a journalist in a historically under-covered neighborhood to report on the important news and share positive stories from the community.\n\nReport for America selected participating newsrooms through a rigorous national competition that considered a range of criteria, including a location\u2019s history of mentoring, its content distribution strategy success measures and its commitment to trust-building behaviors through transparency in reporting.\n\nJournalists can apply for these newsroom positions through January 31. Final selections will be made by RFA and Scripps, with newsroom placements announced in April. Selected journalists will attend Report for America\u2019s intensive training in June before joining newsrooms.\n\nAbout Scripps"}}
