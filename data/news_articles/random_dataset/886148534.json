The sale is expected to close during the first quarter of 2020.\n\n\"When we created Pixelle, we stated that we would leverage our differentiated, customized approach to manufacturing to help Pixelle build on its great reputation with customers and strengthen its position in the specialty paper markets it serves,\" said Steven Klingler, executive chairman of Pixelle. \"Since then, we have made significant progress and we believe there are still many opportunities to continuej to drive growth and enhance our operations. Through the addition of these two mills, we are positioning Pixelle for the future and look forward to continuing to be the best supplier and partner for our customers.\"\n\nOnce the deal closes, Pixelle will operate four paper mills which, in addition to the new acquisitions and the Chillicothe mill also includes a mill in Spring Grove, Pennsylvania, acquired at the same time as the Chillicothe facility. Three of those mills have on-site pulp mills with a total of 12 paper machines and the ability to produce more than one million tons of paper annually in aggregate. The company also counts additional operations in its portfolio, including a converting facility in Fremont, Ohio, and wood fiber sourcing operations in strategic wood baskets in Maine, Maryland, Ohio and West Virginia.\n\nOhio University Chillicothe Theater Program presents \"Tragedy: A Tragedy\" fall production\n\nCHILLICOTHE - The Ohio University Chillicothe Theater program will present their fall production of \"Tragedy: A Tragedy\" by Will Eno at 8 p.m. on Nov. 14 through 16 and at 2 p.m. on Nov. 16 and 17 in the Bennett Hall Auditorium.\n\nA $25 per person dinner theater event will take place on Friday, November 15 prior to the show, which includes dinner and admission to the show. Proceeds from the event contribute to the Jayne Stone Brown theater scholarship, which is awarded to a theater student each year.\n\n\"Tragedy: A Tragedy\" introduces the audience to a team of local broadcasters who are covering the setting of the sun. The news team, struggling to tease out some event to report on, decides to focus on remarks from the governor that suggests the sun may never rise again.\n\nThis production will feature a cast of five characters, including Frank in the Studio, Constance at the Home, John in the Field, Michael, the Legal Analyst, and the Witness, played by current OHIO Chillicothe students, to bring this story to life.\n\nDr. Lance Mekeel, OHIO Chillicothe Theater Program Director, said he chose \"Tragedy: A Tragedy\" for its message about how living in an increasingly mediatized world, we as humans are decreasingly connected and capable of sharing our experiences as humans.\n\n\u201cThis play provides the audience an opportunity to reflect on how ultimately language fails us to adequately understand one another,\u201d he said. \u201cThe comedy of how these characters go through the breaking down of their means of relating to one another through the filter of the camera is the tragedy.\u201d\n\nTickets will be available at the door for $10 for general admission (18 yrs.+), $7 for OHIO faculty and staff, $5 for children (17 and under), and free for OHIO students (with ID).
