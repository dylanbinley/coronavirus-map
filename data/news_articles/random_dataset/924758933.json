Jennifer McNern said victims were being kicked down the road again (Liam McBurney/PA)\n\nThe 69-year-old from south Belfast, who campaigned for the pension, said the delay would have a \u201cdevastating effect\u201d on victims.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just victims and survivors, especially people living with appalling injuries, just being kicked down the road again,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSomething or someone is blocking it and, whatever it is, victims and survivors need to know that, they need to be told what it is, the deadline is going to be missed on the 29th, so there needs to be a new and appropriate deadline put in place.\n\n\u201cI am angry and I\u2019m shocked, to tell you the truth, I am pretty dismayed by it all, especially at such a late stage and especially when it\u2019s legislated for, it\u2019s in law.\n\n\u201cIt will happen but I think the important thing to watch here is that it doesn\u2019t drift on for years, with politicians arguing about it because that can happen very easily.\u201d\n\nMPs at Westminster legislated for the scheme last year.\n\nThe British government signed off on regulations to establish it earlier this year with the Stormont Executive handed the responsibility to develop it.\n\nThe scheme is set to cost about \u00a3100 million.\n\nThe payment in the first year is set to be much higher than the recurring costs thereafter, because successful applicants will initially be able to claim backdated payments to 2014, when the idea of a victims pension was first approved in the Stormont House Agreement.\n\nThousands of applicants are anticipated, with pension awards varying from \u00a32,000 to \u00a310,000 a year depending on the severity of injury.\n\nIn some cases, a relative of those injured may qualify for the scheme\n\nWhile the majority of applications are anticipated to be approved on the basis of medical records, a judge was to be appointed to chair a committee to adjudicate on less clear-cut cases. Former Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith set out the regulations for the scheme in January (Liam McBurney/PA)\n\nAlex Bunting, 65, had a leg blown off in an under-car bomb attack in Belfast in 1991.\n\nThe taxi driver, who lives in Bangor, was targeted by the IRA in a case of mistaken identity.\n\nHe has also been a long-time campaigner for the pension.\n\n\u201cEverybody is dumbfounded, they are caught on the hop,\u201d he said of the delay.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be a lot of anger and disappointment and it\u2019ll put some people over the edge.\n\n\u201cWhat are you supposed to do?\n\n\u201cYou jump through all the hoops, you do all the work, and then all of a sudden, what do they do, they turn round and let the people down here in Northern Ireland who have suffered the most when it comes to, like, conflict.\n\n\u201cI am actually personally disgusted at the way it has panned out.\u201d\n\nMr Bunting said the funds needed for the scheme were \u201cvery small in the grand scheme of things\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou just get sick of listening to the same excuse for something that you thought was done and dusted and now we\u2019re just left in this whole dilemma of people getting let down,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Executive Office and Northern Ireland Office has been asked for comment."}}
