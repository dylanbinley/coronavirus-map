Acting Labor Secretary: COVID-19 spike doing 'tremendous damage' to economy", "TEXT": "The Daily Beast\n\nLori Loughlin, the actress at the center of the nation-wide college admissions scandal, was sentenced Friday to two months in prison after admitting to paying thousands of dollars to get her two daughters into top colleges. The sentencing over video-conference in Boston federal court came hours after her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, was sentenced to five months in prison for his role in getting the couple\u2019s daughters admitted to the University of Southern California by falsely portraying them as elite athletes. During the hearing, the 54-year-old actress, best known for playing Aunt Becky on Full House, sat silently as prosecutors argued she should receive the maximum sentence her plea deal allows because she was \u201cfully complicit\u201d in the scheme. The actress\u2019s defense attorney, however, argued that Loughlin is \u201cprofoundly sorry for the role that she played\u201d in the scheme and that of all the parents charged in the nationwide scandal, \u201cnot a single one had less participation than Lori.\u201d Loughlin then issued a brief apology, saying she\u2019s \u201cready to face the consequences.\u201d\u201cI made an awful decision. I went along with a plan to give my daughters an unfair advantage in the college admissions process. I thought I was acting out of love for my children, but in reality it only undermined my daughters' abilities and accomplishments,\u201d Loughlin, dressed in a white blouse, said Friday. \u201cI will do everything in my power to redeem myself. Your honor, I am truly, profoundly, and deeply sorry.\u201dIn addition to the prison sentence, Loughlin will have to pay a $150,000 fine and perform 100 hours of community service, U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton ruled. Giannulli will pay a $250,000 fine and perform 250 hours of community service.Lori Loughlin\u2019s Daughter Olivia Jade Returns to YouTube After College Admissions Scandal: \u2018I Want to Move On\u2019Before sentencing Loughlin, the judge admonished the actress for her role in the college admission\u2019s scandal, stating that while he believes she is remorseful, he does not understand why somebody who already had a \u201cfairytale life\u201d needed to \u201cgrab even more.\u201d\u201cYou have participated in the corruption of the system of higher education in this country,\u201d Gorton said. \u201cI hope you will spend the rest of your charmed life making amends for the system you have harmed.\u201dGorton also tore into Giannulli, stating that the designer\u2019s crime was \u201cmotivated by hubris\u201d and stressed that his prison sentence for wire and mail fraud offenses will send a message to other parents that buying their children\u2019s way into college is \u201cnot the way it works in this country.\u201d In Loughlin\u2019s case, the judge also noted, there was \u201ca loss to the overall education system\u201d due to the couple\u2019s actions.\u201cI deeply regret... the harm that my actions have caused my daughter, my wife, and others,\u201d Giannulli told the court before his sentencing. \u201cI take full responsibility for my conduct. I\u2019m ready to accept the consequences and move forward with the lessons I\u2019ve learned from this experience.\u201dFriday\u2019s sentencing marks the end of a nearly 17-month saga for the celebrity couple, who pleaded guilty in May after originally denying their roles in what was described as the \u201clargest college admissions scam prosecuted by the Justice Department,\u201d dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.Nearly 50 parents were charged last March after allegedly paying admissions consultant William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, 58, more than $25 million in total to rig test scores, cheat on SAT exams, and bribe college coaches, with the goal of getting their children into elite universities, including the University of Southern California, Georgetown, Stanford, and Yale. Among those charged was actress Felicity Huffman, who served an 11-day prison sentence in October after pleading guilty to conspiracy for paying $15,000 to boost her daughter\u2019s SAT scores. Singer, the alleged mastermind, pleaded guilty in Boston court last year to charges including racketeering, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice.Loughlin, 55, and her husband, 56, paid Singer $500,000 to get their two daughters admitted to USC as rowing recruits, even though neither teen had participated in the sport. The payment was made out to Key Worldwide Foundation, a non-profit organization run by Singer. In a detention memo released Tuesday, prosecutors argued Giannulli should get a longer sentence than his wife because he \u201cengaged more frequently with Singer, directed the bribe payments to USC and Singer, and personally confronted his daughter\u2019s high school counselor to prevent the scheme from being discovered, brazenly lying about his daughter\u2019s athletic abilities.\u201d But while Loughlin took \u201ca less active role,\u201d prosecutors stressed she was \u201cfully complicit,\u201d eagerly enlisting Singer a second time to help the couple\u2019s younger daughter \u201cand coaching her daughter not to 'say too much' to her high school's legitimate college counselor, lest he catch on to their fraud.\u201d Neither of the couple\u2019s daughters, who are no longer enrolled in USC, have been charged in the scheme.
