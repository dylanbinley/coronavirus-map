Prejudices \u2013 whether visible or invisible, conscious or unconscious\u2014remain a burden to many. They hold back the diversity of the force, representation in our officer ranks, and experiences of our minority members. pic.twitter.com/uhScevfv9y \u2014 @EsperDoD (@EsperDoD) June 18, 2020\n\nThat issue specifically, of including photos on promotion board packets, has been called out for promoting bias in board members who might be more likely to favor a white service member over one of color.\n\nEsper also announced the formation of the Defense Board on Diversity and Inclusion in the Military, an internal group of uniformed and civilian personnel who will have six months to make recommendations to Esper on what the Defense Department can do to tackle inequality within its organizations.\n\n\u201cThe members of this board will have the carte blanche and resources to chart their own course,\u201d he said in an eight-minute video message. \u201cThey will report to me, and will be tasked to bring me their findings and recommendations in December.\u201d\n\nA longer term, follow-up body, dubbed the Defense Advisory Committee on Diversity and Inclusion in the Armed Services, will take after the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, which stood up in 1951 to guide the Pentagon through the integration of women into the services, and is principally made up of retired general and noncommissioned officers.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Mark Milley, saw themselves pulled into the fray during a June 1 trip to the White House, during which they accompanied President Trump across Lafayette Square to view rioting damage at St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church. The damage came during protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man prosecutors say was murdered by a white Minneapolis police officer.\n\nThe military is supposed to stay out of politics, but it keeps getting dragged in President Trump's enthusiastic support of sending troops in to tamp down on protests has put the Defense Department in an uncomfortable position.\n\nLive news cameras broadcast the two alongside Trump\u2019s entourage as the president held up a Bible and made remarks about America coming back \u201cstronger than ever,\u201d Milley in his Army combat uniform and Esper posing for a photo with the president and a handful of other cabinet secretaries and advisers.\n\nSECDEF Mark Esper talks to DC National Guard troops at 15th and K in DC. @MilitaryTimes pic.twitter.com/m4uF1i3JaW \u2014 Howard Altman (@haltman) June 2, 2020\n\nLater that week, both Esper and Milley released public statements about the military\u2019s role in the national discourse \u2015 as thousands of National Guardsmen were mobilized to support police in anti-protest efforts and active-duty infantrymen and military police staged outside Washington, D.C. in anticipation of Trump invoking the Insurrection Act.\n\nThough Milley did not mention the Black Lives Matter movement in his statement, Esper did address racism during remarks at the Pentagon, following a series of public messages from senior military leaders, beginning with Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force Kaleth Wright, who is black.\n\nEsper, Milley and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, all current or former Army officers, voiced their support for opening a discussion within the Army about renaming 10 posts, including Fort Benning, Georgia, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Hood, Texas.\n\nSupporters of the change have argued that is disrespectful to black service who are assigned to posts bearing the names of generals who fought the Civil War to keep them enslaved. It has also been pointed out that, in addition to defecting to the losing side of that war, some of them \u2015 including Braxton Bragg and John Bell Hood \u2015 were best known for their incompetence and recklessness, rather than any exceptional personal heroism or tactical success.\n\nThose discussions quickly died down after Trump tweeted his support for keeping the names.\n\nIt has been suggested that we should rename as many as 10 of our Legendary Military Bases, such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Benning in Georgia, etc. These Monumental and very Powerful Bases have become part of a Great American Heritage, and a... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 10, 2020\n\nThat effort is now in Congress\u2019s hands, but in the meantime, the Pentagon may be able to make some of its own headway.\n\n\u201cWhile we pursue these initiatives, I ask each and every one of you to reflect upon the issues of race, bias, and inequality in our ranks, and have the tough, candid discussions with your superiors, your peers, and your troops that this issue demands,\u201d Esper said in his video message. \u201cThis is an added responsibility for our officers and NCOs, who must also double down on your mentorship of up-and-coming minority leaders, and make diversity and inclusion a priority. This is what I expect of leaders.\u201d"}}
