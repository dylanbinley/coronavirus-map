The president addressed a packed house of some 14,000 supporters at Veteran\u2019s Memorial Coliseum.\n\nTrump talked about the jobs he has created since taking office three years ago. He also promoted his tax cuts, the border wall, and claimed he has done a lot of work to benefit veterans.\n\nHe also used the opportunity to take a few jabs at billionaire democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg who made his debut on the debate stage in Las Vegas ahead of Nevada\u2019s caucuses on Saturday. Trump reported to his supporters that the Democratic rivals were pounding Bloomberg and drew cheers when he said the Democratic nominee didn't matter because \u201cwe're going to win.\u201d\n\nEarlier Wednesday, President Trump raised tons of campaign cash and revved up his base in California.\n\nTrump's visit to Phoenix drew a few hundred protesters who staged rallies near the state fairgrounds where the president was speaking."}}
