They need to make a fairer contribution.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson meets US President Donald Trump (Stefan Rousseau/PA)\n\nMr Johnson earlier stressed the importance of the British PM having \u201cgood relationships\u201d with the US president, describing it as \u201ca geopolitical, geo-strategic fact\u201d alongside having such relationships with other countries.\n\nAsked if President Donald Trump had done him a favour by saying he would not want anything to do with the NHS even if handed to the US on a silver platter, the PM replied: \u201cI want to stress that under no circumstances whatever will any part of the NHS be for sale and this is periodically, metronomically produced in a completely fraudulent way by the Labour Party in order to distract from the vacuity of their position on Brexit and their unwillingness to get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson also refused to engage in talk about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020.\n\nQuizzed on whether he would advise businesses to continue planning for a no-deal outcome, Mr Johnson said: \u201cWe have a great deal. It\u2019s going to allow us to come out smoothly and efficiently on January 31.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would advise companies to cease no-deal preparations, Mr Johnson repeated the UK has a \u201cgreat deal\u201d in place."}}
