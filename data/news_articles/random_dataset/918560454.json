We have stopped all services in the back of the jail where civilians come in and go to the back for counseling or religious services. All of that is done by video now.\u201d\n\nLeigh Patterson, the district attorney for Floyd, declined to comment.\n\nThe Bartow County man who was the alleged target of the murder plot said he was informed of the bond hearing by the victim advocate in the district attorney\u2019s office. The news added to the stress he and his wife have felt since being informed of the plot, he said.\n\n\u201cThe last couple of months have been an unending string of traumas,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution is withholding the man\u2019s name as the alleged target of a conspiracy by a hate group.\n\nThe social isolation required by the COVID-19 pandemic, the man added, has made recovery from the shock of being targeted by a hate group more difficult. He was surprised the alleged Base members thought they might be released.\n\n\u201cThey do not need to be out among the public,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this case, I\u2019m glad the judge did the right thing.\u201d\n\nLast month, a federal judge refused to set bond for a Maryland man linked by the FBI to the same white supremacist group. Brian Mark Lemley Jr.'s attorney cited the virus and Lemley's risk of infection behind bars, The Baltimore Sun reported. Lemley has been indicted on gun-related charges."}}
