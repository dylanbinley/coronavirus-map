We don't want Bernie getting sick or anything like that. He's 78.\"\n\nDrew Mantenieks, a Ohio Northern University student from Westerville also showed up at the Sanders rally only to learn it was canceled.\n\n\"Yeah, it's like I understand,\" he said. \" I want him to be president so if this is what precaution he has to take I'm not going to mad about it.\""}}
