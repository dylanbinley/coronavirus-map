Activists say ordinary depositors are footing the bill for a liquidity crisis worsened by politicians, senior civil servants and bank owners who used their influence to get their hefty savings out of the country.\n\nIskandar revealed that a Swiss official has told him that the transferred money amounts to $2 billion and that it belongs to \u201cnine Lebanese politicians.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s dangerous is that the sums were transferred over the past 15 days, during the peak of the liquidity crisis,\u201d Iskandar explained.\n\n\u201cThe Swiss parliament has started a serious probe into the issue and it will publicize the results of this investigation once it is finished, and I don\u2019t believe that the Lebanese side will obtain information before the end of the Swiss probe,\u201d Iskandar added.\n\n\u201cThere is major difficulty in recovering funds sent abroad,\u201d Iskandar said, reminding that the Philippines has failed to retrieve $2.5 billion transferred by a president who died 30 years ago and that Egypt has also failed to recover the funds sent abroad by ousted president Hosni Mubarak."}}
