A bad headline (written by me) or poor timing (also chosen by me) or a misunderstood ingredient that I failed to make understood are usually the culprits.\n\nAs we know, clicks aren't always a barometer for what's really truly good\u2014just what appears good to the most people on first glance. So these are the ten diamonds in the rough that most of you missed the first time around (and I won't let that happen again).\n\nThe Most Overlooked Genius Recipes of 2019\n\nWhy you didn\u2019t care: My headline was The Key to the Most Flavorful Braised Chicken on the Block\u2014straightforward but awfully snoozy.\n\nWhy you should: This chicken is anything but. Chef Donald Link is thoughtful about salt, and here green olives and salami make for a more well-rounded \"Why is this so good?\" seasoning than straight kosher. Or you could just take it from Food52er weekend at bearnaise: \"It was, hands down, one of the best things to ever come out of my kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Food52 Donald Link's Braised Chicken With Salami & Olives\n\nWhy you didn\u2019t care: Making pizza sounds hard?\n\nWhy you should: Making pizza is fun and rewarding, and Deb Perelman at Smitten Kitchen hand-picked this one from No-Knead Breadman Jim Lahey for us. Did you catch that it's five ingredients total, for both the topping and the crust?\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Food52 Jim Lahey\u2019s 5-Ingredient Summer Squash Pizza\n\nWhy you didn\u2019t care: You saw creamy! and vegan! and the cognitive dissonance was just too much.\n\nWhy you should: Of all the clever recipes J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt has created in his career writing the Food Lab at Serious Eats, this 15-minute soup is one of his favorites, and the one he makes most often.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Food52 J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt's 15-Minute Creamy (Vegan) Tomato Soup\n\nWhy you didn\u2019t care: I said \"Buffalo sauce\" and then showed you a salad. Fair enough.\n\nWhy you should: You could use this sauce the usual way and be the person with the extra, suspiciously good Buffalo wings. But, by adding in one extra ingredient (a boatload of roasted garlic), your sauce will taste even better with all the other things we could be Buffaloing. Like salad!\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Food52 Buffalo Cucumbers from Parm & Peter Meehan\n\nWhy you didn\u2019t care: I said \"turkey burger,\" then showed you a salad (again!).\n\nWhy you should: Whether you serve it on a bun or next to a baked potato, lean meat needs a lot more help than we've been giving it. Here, inspired by traditional Parsi kebabs, cookbook author Niloufer Ichaporia King jams it full of moisture (and flavor) with a mess of herbs, scallions, ginger, and chiles.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Food52 Niloufer Ichaporia King\u2019s Turkey (or Chicken or Pork) Parsi Burgers\n\nWhy you didn\u2019t care: We tried a little experiment where we skipped the Genius article this week and put the whole story on the recipe page. As it turns out, that makes the recipe much harder to find!\n\nWhy you should: Pastry chef Karen DeMasco's one-bowl, any-jam, any-nut crumble bar is one of my very favorites from Genius Desserts, and from life. Once you make it, you'll memorize it.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Food52 Back-to-School Raspberry Granola Bars From Karen DeMasco\n\nWhy you didn\u2019t care: Making pizza sounds hard (reprise). And this one is Hawaiian\u2014controversial! It also probably didn't help that I wrote \"haters\" in the headline.\n\nWhy you should: Regardless of how you feel about pineapple and Canadian bacon, any homemade pizza can benefit from dough master Ken Forkish\u2019s sneaky-genius trick of tucking a thin layer of bacon grease below the sauce. You won\u2019t taste bacon, you will just taste good.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Food52 Ken Forkish's Hawaiian Pizza\n\nWhy you didn\u2019t care: Maybe putting \"poisonous\" in the headline wasn't the best idea.\n\nWhy you should: But the thing is, not only are carrot greens not poisonous, they're delicious\u2014and free with purchase of carrots! But you can also just make this wonder-dressing for other vegetables, tofu, or meats in the genre of cold salads known as liang ban.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Food52 Georgia Freedman & Tusheng Shiguan\u2019s Carrot Greens Salad\n\nWhy you didn\u2019t care: Maybe you didn't know you wanted radish tacos.\n\nWhy you should: You do! Because you never know when you'll need a good vegetarian (and easily made vegan) main, and because this one was designed artfully by chef Anita Lo to work well for solo diners but scale well to feed many.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Food52 Anita Lo's Roasted and Pickled Radish Tacos\n\nWhy you didn\u2019t care: We sent this out at the bottom of a fairly long newsletter the day before Thanksgiving. Adding a Spanish tortilla to the menu\u2014even if you can make it out of little more than a leftover bag of potato chips\u2014may not have seemed in the cards.\n\nWhy you should: Ferran Adri\u00e0's famous tortilla hack skips many of the traditional steps\u2014no slicing or slow-frying potatoes and onions\u2014for a near-instant power lunch, dinner, or a snack (and one of the more iconic Genius Recipes around).\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Food52 Potato Chip Tortilla Espa\u00f1ola From Ferran Adri\u00e0\n\nRelated video: How to make shrimp scampi [provided by the Rachael Ray Show]\n\nGot a genius recipe to share\u2014from a classic cookbook, an online source, or anywhere, really?
