However, the university has also said the reports haven\u2019t been confirmed but officials are urging any students who get the reported manifesto air dropped to alert school officials.\n\nThe new investigation comes on the heels of racist graffiti being found Monday night at Day Hall dorm. Officials have been speaking with residents in the residence hall, but no one has reportedly been identified as a culprit.\n\nIt was the fourth piece of racist graffiti found in Day Hall over the last month, along with four other reported incidents across campus still under investigation. One of these reported incidents included a female student reporting that several fraternity members verbally attacked her with racist language Saturday night, prompting the school to suspend fraternity activities for the semester.\n\n\u201cI have deep appreciation of the pain, anger and anxiety recent events have caused on our campus,\u201d Syracuse Chancellor Kent Syverud said in a video message to the school. \u201cThe social activities of all fraternities have been suspended for the remainder of this semester.\u201d\n\nCBS News has reported that school officials identified the students responsible for Saturday\u2019s fraternity incident. However, some students have expressed concerns that not enough has been done by the school to address the incidents.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely like bubbling tension,\u201d graduate student Isaac Howland told local CBS affiliate WLNY. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s gonna have much long-lasting effect beyond the semester or, at best, next semester. It\u2019s just like, yeah, you guys can\u2019t throw any more parties.\u201d\n\nPeaceful protests and sit-ins have broken out across campus demanding Syracuse University do more to address the incidents and have reportedly provided a list of demands. It allegedly includes $1 million to open new classes on diversity and the school has been given a Wednesday deadline."}}
