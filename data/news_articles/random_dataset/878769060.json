As the populations of cities grow and change, in part through gentrification, we must honor the communities whose \u201copportunities were denied\u201d due to redlining, urban renewal, and other discriminatory practices based on race. Urban planners, architects, and landscape architects can help communities unearth and then preserve this history through \u201cremembrance design,\u201d a process that can tell the story of \u201chistorically disenfranchised and negatively impacted communities,\u201d said Kenneth Luker, with Perkins + Will, at a session at the Urban Land Institute (ULI)\u2019s fall meeting in Washington, D.C. This is the way to \u201creconcile with the past and use history to create an inclusive future.\u201d\n\nZena Howard, principal and managing director, and Michael Stevenson, urban designer at multidisciplinary design firm Perkins + Will; Cynthia Lau, a planner with the Vancouver city government; and Kofi Boone, ASLA, a professor of landscape architecture at North Carolina State University, explained how to plan and design that shared future.\n\nHoward said \u201ccuriosity about the past can drive a process of remembrance. We can research and dig into communities to recover memories of removed or destroyed areas.\u201d Through connecting with African American communities that have experienced a history of urban displacement, designers can help \u201cbuild community awareness, foster memorable experiences, embrace cultural identity, celebrate memory, and honor unique assets.\u201d\n\nShe called for undertaking a true discovery process with communities that have been impacted by urban renewal, redlining, or other forms of racism. \u201cDiscovery is not just community engagement \u2014 it is the process.\u201d\n\nKofi Boone argued that the architecture and planning community hadn\u2019t been asked to take responsibility for the disproportionate social impact on African American and Latinx communities of redlining, which involved a federal, state, and local system of purposefully denying mortgages to African Americans and walling off entire neighborhoods from investment, and urban renewal, which involved clearing existing communities to make way for Modernist urban designs and highway infrastructure. That is until African American civil rights activist Whitney Young gave a keynote address to the American Institute of Architects (AIA) conference in 1968. In his address, Young called on the built environment community to stop contributing to social displacement.\n\nAs Richard Rothstein explained in his book Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America, redlining impacted some 160 urban and suburban communities across the U.S. for many decades. Given home ownership is the primary source of wealth accumulation for most Americans, the result today is African Americans have far lower amounts of wealth than Caucasian Americans. Little accumulated wealth through home ownership meant little for future generations to inherit. \u201cToday, the average white family has $122,000 in wealth; Latinx family $1,600; and African American family, just $1,300,\u201d Boone said.\n\nUrban renewal compounded the impacts of redlining. Communities that had suffered from years of disinvestment were highly vulnerable to redevelopment. Modernists saw places with rich histories as clean slates that could be re-made. According to Boone, some 200 communities were \u201crenewed,\u201d which in social terms meant displaced. The result was \u201croot shock,\u201d a term coined by Mindy Thompson Fullilove in her book, Root Shock: How Tearing Up City Neighborhoods Hurts America, And What We Can Do About It. For many African American communities, there wasn\u2019t just one displacement either: \u201cserial displacements created long-term disruption.\u201d And generation after generation experienced these \u201cmajor shocks to the system.\u201d\n\nIn Greenville, North Carolina, Perkins + Will worked with remnants of the once-vibrant African American Sycamore Hill community, which was displaced by urban renewal in the 1960s. As the community hollowed out, the Sycamore Hill Baptist Church burned to the ground from suspected arson. \u201cThere was nothing left,\u201d Michael Stevenson, a partner at Perkins + Will, said.\n\nIn the footprint of where the church once stood, Howard and her team partnered with the community to plan and design the Sycamore Hill Gateway Plaza, which will feature a prominent tower to honor the history of the destroyed spiritual center. Pew-like benches are set amid a one-acre park separated by plinths with inspirational messages and depictions of local history. The project is part of a broader master plan for a new park called Greenville Town Commons on state and city land. \u201cIt\u2019s a place of learning, remembrance, and reflection.\u201d Its development has been a \u201cmeaningful process for the community.\u201d\n\nAfrican American architect Phil Freelon, who was a partner at Perkins + Will and passed away earlier this year, partnered with the community to plan and design the 1-acre Freedom Park in Raleigh, North Carolina in a symbolic space between the State general assembly and capitol buildings. \u201cHonoring the history repressed in history books, the plaza park will celebrate the significant contributions of African Americans from the Raleigh area, including jazz great Thelonious Monk, author Maya Angelou, John Coltrane, and others,\u201d Stevenson said. The park features a grove of Oak trees but also their roots, which \u201cmake life possible.\u201d The park\u2019s paths, which radiate out from the Oaks, symbolize those roots \u2014 \u201cthe hidden history.\u201d The park is designed to be a \u201cbeacon of freedom and a representation of a better future for everyone.\u201d\n\nCanada has its own fraught racial history as well. In Vancouver, the historically-Black Northeast False Creek neighborhood, which includes the Hogan\u2019s Alley area, suffered from the Canadian version of redlining and then further destruction with the construction of a highway. \u201cIn the process, the community was displaced and erased from history,\u201d said Cynthia Lau, a planner with the Vancouver city government. \u201cIt\u2019s like they were never really part of the city.\u201d Today, the black community makes up just 1 percent of Vancouver.\n\nAfter a conventional planning process failed to account for the voice of Black Vancouverites, the city tried again with a new set of consultants, including Howard\u2019s team at Perkins+Will, which undertook a \u201cco-design process that helped people tell their stories.\u201d The end result, Lau said, is a \u201cmeaningful community development plan\u201d rooted in the goals of \u201creconciliation and cultural redress.\u201d Viaducts will be replaced with street-level transportation networks. Some 32 acres of new parks are planned, along with affordable housing for 3,200 residents. The new development is expected to create 6,000-8,000 new local jobs as well.\n\nAt the close of the session, Boone reiterated that architects, planners, and landscape architects \u201ccan\u2019t do remembrance design processes alone. Success comes from partnerships with policymakers, community leaders, and activists. You have to bring in people who haven\u2019t been heard before.\u201d For authentic engagement, \u201cthe most historically disenfranchised communities should have the loudest voice.\u201d\n\nDesigners can help communities \u201creclaim their narrative and identify what is important to them.\u201d They also have a responsibility to ensure those long-unheard voices don\u2019t \u201cget lost in translation.\u201d\n\nFor Boone, remembrance design isn\u2019t just superficial social justice-washing. \u201cThese projects can catalyze political, social, and economic organization.\u201d Howard reiterated that the process itself is what\u2019s important. The stories unearthed through the co-design process are really the basis for \u201caccessible, inclusive spaces.\u201d\n\nRemembrance design isn\u2019t just for co-designing with African American communities either. Boone said he knows of designers working with Latinx communities to help them \u201cdream and visualize change,\u201d even through many of these visions haven\u2019t taken real form, largely because these communities now feel so unsafe due to President Trump\u2019s rhetoric and the threat of ICE raids. \u201cThese communities are now in the process of gathering stories and empowering themselves.\u201d\n\nAnd Chinese American communities have also organized to create positive change. In Seattle, plans were underway to remake and expand the underused and unloved Hing Hay Park. In 2012, the Friends of Hing Hay Park formed, demanding a more contemporary and culturally-resonant public space. Chinese landscape architecture firm Turenscape, led by Kongjian Yu, FALSA, partnered with MIG|Svr to create a new design that reflects China\u2019s many diverse cultures and created space for night markets."}}
