They were in the US to publicly make the case that she should return to the UK to face justice.\n\nTheir 19-year-old son was killed on his motorbike on 27 August in a collision when Sacoolas drove with her children in the wrong lane at the brow of a hill near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire, where her husband, Jonathan Sacoolas, worked.\n\nAs the wife of a US intelligence officer, she was able to claim diplomatic immunity to leave the country after the accident, despite assuring British police she would stay.\n\n\u201cIt is not clear whether Sacoolas is acting freely in refusing to return to the UK or instead is acting on the orders of US intelligence,\u201d reports The Guardian.\n\nDiffering accounts of the meeting\n\n\u201cPresident Trump came off as a very warm, engaging guy, he makes you feel really special,\u201d Radd Seiger, the family spokesperson, told CNN. \u201cBut once the pleasantries were over, and we sat down, he said: \u2018Let\u2019s cut to the chase. You want to meet Mrs Sacoolas. I can make that happen\u2019... She was next door. It was a shock.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe feel a little numb. There wasn\u2019t any real progress, apart from right at the end, the president saying he would look at it from another angle. Reflecting on it this morning, I think Charlotte and Tim realise that the president was only doing it for himself.\u201d\n\nTalking to reporters yesterday, President Trump offered a different picture. \u201cIt was beautiful in a way,\u201d he said, \u201cit was very sad... She was in the room right out there, we met right here. I offered to bring the person in question in and they weren\u2019t ready for it.\u201d\n\nHe went on to claim that the event had been requested by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and speculated that his best efforts to arrange a \u201chealing meeting\u201d had been thwarted by lawyers. \u201cUnfortunately they wanted to meet with her and unfortunately when we had everybody together they decided not to meet. Perhaps they had lawyers involved by that time, I don\u2019t know exactly.\u201d\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nFor a round-up of the most important stories from around the world - and a concise, refreshing and balanced take on the week\u2019s news agenda - try The Week magazine.

Anne accepted the invitation to the White House with the hope that the family would meet and was disappointed.\u201d\n\nSacoolas has apologised through her attorney for what she called a \u201ctragic mistake\u201d.\n\nHer lawyers said: \u201cAnne stayed on the scene of the accident to assist. She spoke to Harry Dunn to tell him that she would call for help.\u201d\n\nThe family of Harry Dunn have made it clear that they wanted a meeting on \u201cour terms, on UK soil\u201d with therapists present for the wellbeing of both sides. Despite this, Trump\u2019s new national security adviser, Richard O\u2019Brien, told them during the meeting that Sacoolas was \u201cnever coming back\u201d to the UK.\n\nA highly choreographed event\n\nSeiger also claimed that he saw press and photographers had been lined up by Trump to capture the two families meeting. \u201cClearly they were looking to get a photo of the president introducing Mrs Sacoolas to Harry\u2019s parents,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Seiger said the encounter felt like a set-up. \u201cI think the family feel a little bit ambushed to say the least,\u201d he added.\n\nWriting for The Guardian, Ross Barkan says: \u201cIt was reality TV spectacle at its most soulless and the parents were rightly unwilling to participate in such a farce.\u201d\n\nTrump, he concludes, is \u201ca hollow vessel devoid of tact and empathy, committed to the show, his show, above all else\u2026 He never considered the feelings of the parents because he does not know how to even approximate such emotions. If he cared about others, we would be watching a very different presidency.\u201d"}}
