The strategy of tricking people on the Internet, after all, looks a little too familiar.\n\nThe president spent the days preceding his rally strutting about, touting a likely audience of 1 million; ultimately a modest 6,200 supporters showed up to an arena with space for 19,000, and aides had to dism\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nantle an outdoor stage designed for an overflow crowd.\n\nCampaign manager Brad Parscale insists that \u201cleftists and online trolls doing a victory lap \u2026 don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about\u201d \u2014 because he and his employees \u201cweed out bogus numbers,\u201d and because first-come, first-serve entry meant ticket \u201creservations\u201d were mostly a fiction. But all that weeding didn\u2019t stop the team from predicting that 160 times more people would come out to cheer for their dearest leader than actually made the trip.\n\nThe coronavirus should probably get more credit for the lackluster attendance than radical protesters or what Parscale referred to as \u201capocalyptic media coverage\u201d or Gen Z schemers, but the K-pop boosters may have helped inflate planners\u2019 already bloated expectations for attendance.\n\nAD\n\nSo is that a good thing?\n\nAD\n\nAnyone who disapproves of the president generally and disapproves of the president holding an indoor rally in the middle of a pandemic specifically may well have gloated when the commander in chief couldn\u2019t command a crowd. Yet the tactics young people have adopted for what some have called a new activism are neither new nor, maybe, all that admirable.\n\n\u201cWe kept it on the quiet side,\u201d a young YouTuber who participated in the ploy told the New York Times. \u201cAlt TikTok,\u201d a subculture on the app that thrives on eccentricity, apparently masterminded the effort with the K-poppers. \u201cThey all know the algorithms and how they can boost videos to get where they want.\u201d Plus, we are told, the plotters deleted their posts after a day or two to keep the plan secret \u2060 \u2014 and off the mainstream Web.\n\nAD\n\nAdd to these sneaky tactics the hijacking of the #WhiteLivesMatter hashtag last month to post endless K-pop fancams yet again and to stop supremacists from communicating with one another or anyone else \u2014 and what do you get? Information warfare.\n\nAD\n\nInformation warfare doesn\u2019t consist only of false stories and other lies \u2014 and, in fact, platforms such as Facebook don\u2019t usually take down networks of accounts based on whether they\u2019re telling the truth about whatever they post. They take down networks based on whether they\u2019re telling the truth about who they are.\n\nThese platforms are in a constant crusade against coordinated inauthentic behavior: when groups manipulate sites\u2019 mechanics to manipulate \u201creality\u201d on the Internet, misleading people into thinking comments are coming from one place or one person when really they\u2019re coming from another, or simulating a mass movement from the grass roots when really it\u2019s organized by a central authority.\n\nAD\n\nThink Russia spreading WikiLeaks information under the guise of everyday concerned U.S. citizens. Think right-wing provocateurs masquerading as antifa as protests roared across the country, tricking rural communities to fear attacks were imminent. Or think of information warfare that isn\u2019t technically coordinated inauthentic behavior and yet still can be insidious: conspiracy theorists taking advantage of, say, the way Twitter\u2019s trending topics list is set up to push fringe ideas such as QAnon or Pizzagate into mainstream conversation.\n\nAD\n\nOf course, these TikTokkers also weren\u2019t lying about who they were on any social media site (which probably helps explain why Facebook\u2019s head of security policy says their behavior doesn\u2019t count as coordinated and inauthentic). Yet they were trying to keep their efforts off the radar, and they were playing with platforms\u2019 viral mechanics to rise to the top, and their ultimate aim was to deceive.\n\nWe may smile to see members of a rising generation employ these tricks in service of progressive values. After all, those who pioneered them and who exploit them today often take pride in valuelessness \u2014 bowing down to chaos and crafting a world where we can believe nothing and everything at the same time. Surely it is better to troll to disrupt racism than to promote it.\n\nAD\n\nYet celebrating some manipulation and condemning others is an unsustainable tack for anyone who wants to untangle our world wide web of lies. The whole story is cute and clever, but more than that it\u2019s sad \u2014 sad that this is the activism that feels most normal and most natural to those who grew up in the Internet age, sad that many believe it\u2019s the activism most likely to succeed in a battlefield already full of falsehoods, and sadder still that they may be right.\n\nWatch more Opinions videos:"}}
