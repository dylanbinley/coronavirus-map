Emma Baehr, director of the Baftas, almost hit the nail on the head when discussing the embarrassing all-white nominations for actors last month, calling it an \u201cindustry-wide\u201d issue. But it\u2019s deeper than that.\n\nAsking more people of colour to apply to be voters, or that \u201cmore films need to be made and entered\u201d clearly isn\u2019t enough. And the criteria (five years\u2019 experience in a senior creative, production/post-production or executive role) seem quite restrictive, given how few poc have access to such roles in the first place.\n\nCreatives of colour have been shut out of this industry for as long as it has existed. Telling them to build their own door and force their way in isn\u2019t a useful solution, it\u2019s blame-shifting. This isn\u2019t a matter of a lack of initiative from non-white members of the industry, but the other way around.\n\nIf the statistics reflect a systemic issue, so do how they are recorded. Last year, Ofcom noted that \u201cbroadcasters urgently need to undertake better, more regular monitoring of the make-up of their employees\u201d, with the TV industry offering ethnicity data for only 81 per cent of its workers, and disability figures for just 69 per cent.\n\nIf even the prospect of recording such statistics is an issue in the first place, there needs to be something bolder in place. What that should look like, I\u2019m not sure. Quotas, which the Baftas have already explored by requiring films in the \u201cOutstanding British Film\u201d and \u201cOutstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer\u201d categories to meet BFI diversity standards, could help.\n\nBut crucially, people at the top of the industry need to show they care for more than 24 hours after a white Hollywood darling (rightfully) tells them they should. After all, people of colour have been raising the issue for years.\n\nAs of last year, 6 per cent of senior roles at the BBC were made up of people from ethnic minority backgrounds, while ITV had an even lower proportion. According to a report by The Work Foundation, ethnic minorities have historically faced considerable barriers to both entering and progressing in the British film industry. Prospects are even worse when it comes to management and funding opportunities.\n\nSo, please, to the voters, Bafta heads and gatekeepers across this industry, do not punt the issue back to those who can do little about it. Do not tell us you wish things were better. Do not, for self-serving purposes, talk to us about being disappointed.\n\nTrue disappointment would lead to meaningful change. While the Baftas have vowed to review the awards process, we\u2019ve seen similar efforts in the past and I\u2019m not confident those who can make a difference see this as anything more than a box-ticking exercise, rather than a chance to improve an increasingly bland and predictable roster of mainstream films.\n\nWe may see a complete shift come this time next year, we may not. But, as Sharmaine Lovegrove, a publisher at Dialogue Books and Little, Brown, pointed out on Twitter today: \u201cI hope everyone working in the European and British creative industry sectors takes a few moments to watch [Phoenix\u2019s speech] when they get to their office\u201d, takes a look at the few people of colour there and \u201cthinks about their demonstrative contribution to change for good\u201d."}}
