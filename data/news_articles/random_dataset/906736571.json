That has given me immense happiness. Hence instead of praying to other gods, I started praying to him,\u201d Krishna told Reuters.\n\nKrishna, who lives alone in a village in the southern state of Telangana, has erected a life-size statue to Trump in his yard, while his walls are scrawled with the leader\u2019s name - to the annoyance of his extended family.\n\n\u201cI am facing difficulties because of my relatives,\u201d Krishna said. \u201cThey tell me that I am disgracing them in society. I told them that just like you believe and worship Shiva, I believe and worship Trump. Neither of us can stop the other from doing so.\u201d\n\nKrishna is not the only Indian who reveres Trump.\n\nIn New Delhi, members of the Hindu Sena, a right-wing fringe group, have begun rehearsing a welcome song in his honour.\n\nIts members say Trump shares their hatred of Islamic extremism, and it has drawn attention for boisterous celebrations of his birthday, including pretending to feed cake to photos of his face.\n\n\u201cWe like Donald Trump because he openly spoke about India\u2019s feelings,\u201d Hindu Sena leader Vishnu Gupta told Reuters. \u201c...He openly said that he would eliminate Islamic terrorism from its roots, that is why I am his fan.\u201d\n\nTrump, who like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a reputation as an unabashed populist who shows his enemies no mercy, is making his first visit to India.\n\nTrump\u2019s itinerary starts on Feb. 24 in the western city of Ahmedabad, where he will visit the former home of independence hero Mahatma and address an estimated 125,000 people at a rally. He is due in the capital the following day."}}
