Produced by CBN Films, a division of Pat Robertson\u2019s Christian Broadcasting Network, the documentary takes a \u201csola scriptura\u201d approach. Gordon Robertson, CBN\u2019s president, in an introduction, tells viewers that the producers decided to base the production solely on Patrick\u2019s own writings \u2014 his Confession and his Letter to Coroticus, and shun any legends that have sprung up around the saint\u2019s life.\n\nIt fell to Rhys-Davies, with his wizened face and rich baritone, to portray the Apostle to the Celts as he sits down in his twilight years to write his life story. Younger actors portray Patrick in his earlier years, from the time he was growing up on the far reaches of the Roman Empire, to when he is a slave in Ireland, to when he returns to evangelize the pagans of Eire.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve certainly come to love Patrick,\u201d Rhys-Davies said in an interview this week. \u201cThere is about him such a mixture of the practical and the spiritual, such a mixture of really deep abiding religious intensity and the sense that his own private life\u2026\u201d The actor hesitated, then continued, referring to the opening lines of the autobiography: \u201cWhen he names himself, the next thing he does is describe himself in his own eyes: \u2018I am Patrick. I am a sinner.\u2019 It\u2019s an authentic voice arising from virtually the Dark Ages. This is a man who is abducted in his childhood, becomes a slave, endures the unimaginable horrors of slavery and then the solitude of a shepherd in a strange country, with no one to talk to, nothing but the barest of conditions to work in: cold in winter, wet in summer \u2014 a fearful, frightening life. And dear old Patrick endures.\n\n\u201cAnd then he escapes, goes back to England \u2014 or actually to Wales, most likely; Patrick was probably a Welshman, not that they actually had those names for them in those days \u2014 and received back into the bosom of the family,\u201d continued Rhys-Davies, who himself is from Wales. \u201cAnd slowly, something is aching inside him, and he decides \u2014 because he talks to God and listens \u2014 that it\u2019s his job to go back and change the attitude of those who had enslaved him.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s such absolute courage, and what I love about this man is that energy that comes from him: \u2018I\u2019m going to do this,'\u201d Rhys-Davies said. That determination is strong enough to overcome any objections or suspicion that arises. \u201c\u2018Do you think I\u2019m doing this for my own benefit? When people who become converted give me money, I use that to pay for the upkeep and survival of the next lot of priests that we\u2019re going to send out. It\u2019s not personal benefit or anything like that; it\u2019s missionary work,'\u201d Rhys-Davies characterized Patrick as saying. \u201cHe is a saint, but in so many ways, like some of the later ones, it is his humanity as much as anything else that we love him at all. St. Teresa of Avila would be, not a similar personality, but you sense the wise woman in Teresa, not just the holy spiritual saint, but you also sense the person, rather than the official image of what a saint should be.\u201d\n\nRhys-Davies, who also lent his voice to a 2017 radio production about St. Patrick from the St. Augustine Institute, spoke by phone from his home on the Isle of Man, apologetic that a month ago he had to cancel a trip to New York for a press screening of the film on concerns about the spreading novel coronavirus.\n\n\u201cI sort of anticipated that this would go like this,\u201d he said, referring to the evolving crisis, which has practically shut down all of Italy and sees more and more restriction of movement in New York. He said that he just returned from New Zealand and that he was in a \u201csort of a self-imposed quarantine for two weeks to avoid the chance of spreading any virus he may have picked up on his trip. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the first on the Isle of Man to infect the entire island and end up killing off a few dozen people,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on the observation that I Am Patrick is coming out this St. Patrick\u2019s Day, in the midst of a worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, and with Ireland canceling all its parades, Rhys-Davies noted that the 5th-century St. Patrick \u201cwould say that these misfortunes fell on us because we fell away from Christ; we did not listen to our priests.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatrick now would say, \u2018Well, of course you shouldn\u2019t have these celebrations. You shouldn\u2019t be celebrating a saint; you should be celebrating the Lord, and that you can do where any two or three are gathered together,'\u201d the actor said. \u201cI think Patrick would be very happy not celebrating him. \u2018Just keep your eyes on the main job\u2019 would be his attitude.\u201d"}}
