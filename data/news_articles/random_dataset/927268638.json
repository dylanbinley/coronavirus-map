But she also said the potential spread of the virus through recent street protests drawing hundreds together is a \u201cbig concern\u201d of hers.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what will happen to these numbers after we see the results of lots of people being together in very large groups during the demonstrations and protests. Some folks were wearing masks, some folks weren\u2019t. But certainly, folks were not social distancing,\u201d Krewson said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see \u2014 fingers crossed \u2014 let\u2019s hope that doesn\u2019t result in a big bump up.\u201d\n\nDr. Alex Garza, commander of the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force, said congregating closely increases the probability of spreading the coronavirus. But being outdoors \u2014 where the virus can disperse more quickly \u2014 and wearing a mask decreases the risk, Garza said.\n\n\u201cWe are still not sure how UV light (from the sun) will impact the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cBut presumably it will help decrease transmission.\u201d\n\nThings that increase the risk include the density of crowds as well as if demonstrators are yelling and speaking loudly, he said, \u201cwhich produces greater volumes of droplets and aerosolization of the virus.\u201d"}}
