Azhar Abbas, President and Ammad Yousuf Secretary General of AEMEND said that the media community is shocked at this blatant act of violence and expresses profound concern over the continued attacks and killing of media men in the line of duty.\n\nThe recent murder is part of a series of attacks against journalists. The association asked Prime Minister Imran Khan and Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to take notice of this brutal murder of Aziz Memon which is tantamount to an attack on the freedom of expression.\n\nSo far, police and other law enforcement agencies have failed to take action against the perpetrators of heinous crimes against media and media men. The association members feel that these acts of violence are aimed to silence the dissenting voice. The AEMEND demanded that the perpetrators should be identified and brought to justice.\n\nBusiness Recorder"}}
