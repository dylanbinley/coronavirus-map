Our Job Retention Scheme FAQ page alone has received more than 85,000 visitors since we set it up in April.\n\n\u201cSo the value of HR during a crisis like this, which affects every aspect of employment, is clear.\u201d\n\nThe HR Dept board also includes founder and executive director Sue Tumelty, finance director Mike Stevenson and non-executive director Keith Sadler.\n\nMrs Tumelty, who set up the business in 2002 before launching the franchising programme in 2005, said: \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to welcome Felicity to the board and we recognise the importance of her role in the potential growth of our company.\n\n\u201cThe workplace is changing rapidly changing and, like all companies, smaller businesses need to be aware of their responsibilities to their employees and cognisant of the benefits of getting their people strategies right.\n\n\u201cThe HR Dept has an opportunity to develop into something even more significant than it is now, and I\u2019m looking forward to the impact that Felicity\u2019s appointment will have on our journey.\u201d"}}
