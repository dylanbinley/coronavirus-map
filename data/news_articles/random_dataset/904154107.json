She added the activity also is a way to usher in the Year of the Rat.\n\n\n\nBaguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong thanked the Metrobank and its partners for the gifts for the indigent families.\n\n\n\nDSWD-Cordillera Focal Person Fe Biba also expressed gratitude to Metrobank for its generosity and support to the 4Ps and the non-4Ps beneficiaries who were recipients of this year\u2019s gift giving event.\n\n\n\nThe Bags of Blessings is a brainchild of Metrobank Group founder and chair, Dr. George S.K Ty. Instead of the traditional angpaos or the red envelopes containing cash, each family beneficiary receives a bag containing P1,000 worth of food itemsduring the celebration of the Chinese New Year.
