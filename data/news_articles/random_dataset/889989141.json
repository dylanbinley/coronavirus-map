The President likewise ruled out the possibility of his daughter, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio will seek the presidency after he completes his term. \u201cLeni, don\u2019t seek to cross over to the presidency. You don\u2019t know anything,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN Philippines late Friday night. Duterte earlier accused Robredo of making \u201can asshole of herself\u201d when she had reached out to foreign entities critical of the administration\u2019s anti-narcotics campaign. He also belittled Robredo, a fellow lawyer, for having to take the Bar exams twice. Duterte fired Robredo as co-chair of the ICAD, 18 days since she assumed the post after insisting there can be no trust between them since they belong to opposing political parties. Robredo, however, said she will disclose matters she had discovered during her short-lived stint in ICAD. \u201cIn the coming days, I will give a report to the people. I will reveal what I discovered and my recommendations,\u201d Robredo said.\u201cI assure you that even if I was stripped of the position, my determination to stop the killings, to make those accountable pay and to win our campaign against illegal drugs remains,\u201d she added. Meanwhile, the President also assured the public that his daughter will not seek the highest public office in 2022. \u201cI told her, \u2018No, do not run.\u2019 She will not run because I told her I will just end up pitying her. What will she do? These fools who think they are bright will think of all kinds of scenarios,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like that. I would rather have someone else run for the presidency because they will just destroy and besmirch the reputation of my daughter,\u201d he added. Duterte-Carpio earlier floated the possibility of gunning for the presidency as she promised to make a decision by January 2021. \u201cMy party-mates do not talk to me about politics. They know I easily get peeved,\u201d the President said."}}
