He expressed \"serious concerns.\"\n\nThe Libra association declined to comment when contacted by AFP.\n\nBut in October, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before a congressional committee that Libra would not be launched until it received all necessary authorizations from the authorities.\n\nIn response to regulators' resistance, Zuckerberg last month opened the door to scaling back plans for Libra if it cannot win the needed approvals."}}
