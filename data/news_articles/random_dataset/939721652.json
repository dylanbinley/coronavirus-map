However, the city said protests, religious events, and press conferences would still be allowed.\n\nCity Hall did not respond to request for comment at press time when asked whether the in-person reading would be permitted under its current guidelines.\n\nSiller did not say whether the group received city approval for the name reading, only saying that he was working with the NYPD and Port Authority Police Department who patrol the area.\n\nSiller said the ceremony would be less than a block large and pointed out that the 9/11 families would be at the memorial that day already.\n\n\u201cI can guarantee to everybody that it will be done in such a safe way,\u201d Siller said. \u201cI would never jeopardize anybody\u2019s health or well being and those families will be down there already at Ground Zero, we\u2019re just giving them an opportunity to read the names.\u201d\n\nThe Tunnel to Towers Foundation is planning its ceremony near Ground Zero for 8:40 a.m.\n\nFamily members who want to speak can register here.\n\nOn Staten Island, the borough\u2019s annual 9/11 Postcards Memorial Ceremony will be held virtually this year. Families will read the names of their loved ones via videotape Borough President James Oddo will incorporate those videos into a live stream.\n\nFOLLOW SYDNEY KASHIWAGI ON TWITTER."}}
