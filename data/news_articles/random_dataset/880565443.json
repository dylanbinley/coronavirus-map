In Tripoli, Lebanon\u2019s second largest city, many gathered in Al-Nour Square, local media reported.\n\nSome protesters also pitched tents in the middle of key roads east and south of Beirut\n\nRubble, burned wood and tires and overturned garbage bins partially blocked main roads inside the capital. Cars slowly passed by the remnants of Thursday\u2019s fires, causing heavy traffic as people headed to work.\n\nBanks, schools and universities were closed Friday as authorities feared an escalation of overnight protests that were marred by riots in the capital that left two people dead and nearly 200 injured, including 60 police.\n\nThe protests erupted Thursday night after the government\u2019s discussion of tax hikes and introducing new fees, including a $0.20 levy per day for WhatsApp calls. The WhatsApp call fee was later revoked. Most of the mass protests died down in central Beirut at dawn after riot police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters.\n\nSource: Agenceis"}}
