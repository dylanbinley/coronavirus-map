The organization has adapted to the times, spreading its branches and finding inspiration in Pope Francis' appeal to \"welcome, protect, promote and integrate\" our brothers and sisters in need.\n\nDec 23, 2019\n\nBy Linda Bordoni\n\nHad Monsignor Patrick Carroll-Abbing known how far the branches of the sapling he planted in Rome back in 1945 would spread, it would most certainly have made him happy.\n\nThe first seeds were planted with the blessing of Pope Pius XII when Carroll-Abbing, an Irish priest, founded Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Towns of Italy to provide vast numbers of orphans and children who had been displaced by WWII with \u201ca chance in life\u201d. Not only did the institution offer them a home, but its unique system of \u201cself-government\u201d and the possibility of pursuing an education and learn skills meant that the children were encouraged to grow up and develop with confidence and creativity, and to become active participants in their communities and builders of their own lives.\n\nThose seeds have given life to Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Towns of Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala and Peru, and today serve over 1000 children living in marginalized and impoverished communities.\n\nMeanwhile, here in Italy, most citizens of the original Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Towns (La Citt\u00e0 dei Ragazzi and La Repubblica dei Ragazzi) are unaccompanied migrant minors. In line with Pope Francis\u2019 determination to help build a more welcoming and just society, Vatican Dicasteries and Councils are partnering with the institution to be able to better respond to his call to \u201cwelcome, protect, promote and integrate\u201d our brothers and sisters fleeing poverty and violence.\n\nThat\u2019s why on Monday, 9 December, the Pope received a group of members and supporters of \u201cA Chance in Life\u201d - as the organization is now known - in the Vatican, encouraging them to continue \u201cto carry out their mission in a world that presents ever new educational challenges.\u201d\n\nIn a conversation with \u201cA Chance in Life\u201d President and Executive Director, Gabriele Delmonaco, I discovered more about how the organization continues to grow and develop in a changing world.\n\n\n\nDelmonaco explained that about 4 years ago the Board of Directors in New York decided to export the model of self-government that initiated in Rome at the \u201cCitt\u00e0 dei Ragazzi\u201d to other parts of the world.\n\nIt was a need that arose from today\u2019s reality that has inevitably changed the face of the original Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Towns where most of the citizens are in Rome are unaccompanied migrant minors fleeing poverty and conflict in the Middle East and Africa.\n\n\u201cWe started in Ethiopia where we help about 400 children,\u201d Delmonaco said, and after that we started two programmes in India in very tribal areas where most of children we support are orphaned girls who otherwise would not have a chance to get an education.\n\nLast year, he continued, we started programmes in Guatemala, Bolivia, Peru and Colombia and we are now exploring a collaboration with local partners in Mexico.\n\n\n\nAudience with Pope Francis\n\nDelmonaco told me that \u201cA Chance in Life\u201d \u2013 as the organization is called today - was founded by Monsignor Carrol-Abbing, who had a strong network in the United States, to support the operations of Boys and Girls Towns Italy, and it still thrives thanks to donors, primarily in the US.--Vatican News"}}
