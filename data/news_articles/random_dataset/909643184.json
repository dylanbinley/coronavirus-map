But the association is asking for Grech\u2019s immediate removal.\n\n\u201cEvidently any meaningful investigation cannot take place until he [Grech] is removed and every day that passes is another day when corruption goes unchecked and impunity continues to reign,\u201d the association said.\n\nIt insisted that it was time to restore a level playing field in the sector."}}
