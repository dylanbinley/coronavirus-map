This is a very timely decision,\u201d Qureshi told a press conference, hours after finance ministers of the G20 countries announced the debt relief for 76 developing nations, including Pakistan. \u201cLook at the scope of this decision. Seventy-six countries will benefit from it.\u201dQureshi credited Prime Minister Imran Khan \u2013 who was one of the first world leaders to call for such a measure \u2013 for the G20 decision. On Sunday Imran issued an appeal to the international community to launch a debt relief initiative.The Group of 20 nations announced a one-year debt standstill for the world\u2019s poorest nations on Wednesday as they struggle to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Qureshi, however, said that the period could be extended since the pandemic situation was still evolving.Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan, who currently chairs the group, told a press briefing following their virtual meeting that \u201ca time-bound suspension of debt service payments \u2026 [will provide] $20 billion of immediate liquidity\u201d for poor countries to \u201csupport their people facing Covid-19\u201d.Qureshi, who spoke to several foreign ministers to get international support for the prime minister\u2019s appeal, said that Pakistan could only manage an economic stimulus package of $8 billion though it was unprecedented, therefore, the impact of the debt relief on the country would be \u201csubstantial\u201d.Pakistan spent $10 to $12 billion annually on debt servicing, he said. \u201cThe details are being worked out by the finance ministry, [but] the impact of debt relief would be \u2018substantial\u2019,\u201d he added.Responding to a question, the foreign minister said the developing countries would get relief on both the principal and the interest amounts. \u201cThe relief will be given by all the financial institutions, including the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the World Bank.\u201dResponding to another question, Qureshi urged US President Donald Trump to review his decision of suspending funds to the World Health Organization (WHO), saying that this was the time all countries should be united against the fight against coronavirus.Also on Thursday, Qureshi met IMF country head in Pakistan Teresa Daban Sanchez and discussed with her the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath. He welcomed the announcements by G20, IMF, World Bank and others for debt-stressed countries.Present situation of Covid-19 and its negative impact on the economy were discussed in detail during the meeting. He apprised the IMP representative of the measures being taken by Pakistan to contain the contagion and address the associated socio-economic challenges.\u201cThe pandemic has affected economies of the entire world but it has severe negative impacts on the developing countries,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite having limited economic resources, Pakistan has taken effective steps to counter the spread of coronavirus and its negative economic fallout.\u201dMeanwhile, China\u2019s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi telephoned Qureshi on Thursday and assured him of China\u2019s continued help to Pakistan to overcome the coronavirus crisis as soon as possible, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement.\u201cWe will continue to provide all possible support according to the needs of Pakistan to help it overcome the epidemic as soon as possible,\u201d he said.\u201cAll sectors of Chinese society \u2026 have actively donated money and materials to provide assistance to Pakistani brothers and sisters within their ability.\u201dQureshi expressed gratitude to China for its valuable support to Pakistan\u2019s fight against the virus. \u201cFaced with this unprecedented global public health and economic crisis, China\u2019s measures are precise and powerful, and have achieved positive results. Pakistan appreciates this,\u201d he added.(WITH INPUT FROM APP)"}}
