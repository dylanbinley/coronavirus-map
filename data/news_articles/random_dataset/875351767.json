(Source: Express photo)\n\nReminding Islamabad of the breakup of Pakistan in 1971 and the creation of Bangladesh, Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Wednesday warned Pakistan not to repeat \u201cthe mistake of 1971\u201d.\n\nAddressing a programme in Jaipur to mark the 103rd birth anniversary of Jan Sangh ideologue Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, Singh said, \u201cBrothers and sisters, we will rather lose an election than deceive you, because we don\u2019t do politics only to form government but to form the country. And by ending Articles 370 and 35A, we have shown that there is no difference between what BJP says and what it does.\u201d\n\nThe Defence Minister also said that following the Pulwama terror attack, India took great precautions and did not attack Pakistan or its army and targeted only terror training camps in Balakot. He said: \u201cLekin aagey yadi aisa hi chalta raha, toh kuch kaha nahi ja sakta (but if it continues like this, then things may change).\u201d\n\nHe said Pakistan \u201ccannot digest\u201d India\u2019s Jammu and Kashmir move, but added, \u201ctrust me, it will be digested.\u201d On August 5, the Centre moved to scrap the special status of J&K and bifurcated the state into two Union Territories.\n\nEXPLAINED | History, geography of terror camp Balakot, recently reactivated by Pakistan\n\n\u201cAur main toh baar baar sujhav de chuka hun Pakistan ko bhi, ke jo \u201865 and \u201871 \u2013 \u201871 mein Pakistan ke do tukde ho gaye the, Pakistan aur Bangladesh ban gaya tha. Maine kaha, \u201871 ki galti mat dohrana, nahi PoK ka kya hoga, achchi tarah samajh lena. (And I have suggested this time and again, even to Pakistan, about (India-Pakistan wars of) 1965 and 1971 \u2013 and in 1971, Pakistan was divided and Bangaldesh was created. I said don\u2019t repeat the mistakes of 1971, else understand well what might happen to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir),\u201d Singh said, accusing Pakistan of trying to divide and destabilise India through terrorism.\n\nAlso Read | Security forces fully prepared: Rajnath Singh on reactivation of Balakot terror camp\n\n\u201cIf we accept the existence of Pakistan, it shouldn\u2019t be assumed that we also accept the existence of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Hum uskey wajood ko sweekar nahi kartey (We don\u2019t accept its existence), because Pakistan has forcefully occupied it,\u201d he said, pointing out that even today, 24 assembly seats \u201care kept vacant in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly for PoK\u201d.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
