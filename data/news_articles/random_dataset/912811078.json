He\u2019s getting down to details that you wouldn\u2019t believe \u2013 what\u2019s happening with the development of a vaccine, can we conduct examinations digitally? It reassures the whole system when there\u2019s a leader who takes the details so seriously. He\u2019s a great example.\u201d\n\nThat laudatory assessment of Benjamin Netanyahu was offered by an official who took part in the decisions over the weekend about whether to put the Israeli economy into lockdown to cope with the coronavirus.\n\nIsrael's coronavirus crisis could be Bibi's swan song. Haaretz weekly podcast\n\nWithout a doubt, the prime minister has his admirers these days as he appears nightly on television and makes difficult decisions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more reassuring that it\u2019s Netanyahu who\u2019s there to make decisions than Benny Gantz,\u201d said another official in a view shared by many.\n\nStill, remember that the two officials realize that they have to praise Netanyahu to counter the strong distrust that surrounds his decision-making process. Does the prime minister have any conflicts of interest in setting Israel\u2019s policies on the pandemic?\n\nYes, a big question mark hovers over Bibi. In contrast to the superlatives rained on him by the two anonymous officials, others are suspicious. The fact is, Netanyahu has a clear interest in fanning the flames of the crisis.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about suspending court cases, including his own corruption trial, until May at the earliest, even though there\u2019s no reason the trials can\u2019t proceed with under 10 people in the courtroom. It\u2019s also about the idea of an emergency government \u2013 of course with Netanyahu as its head.\n\nHe shows no hesitation about taking action and ends each daily broadcast to the nation with a call for an emergency government to be led by himself. He\u2019s a wizard at exploiting a crisis atmosphere and using his TV time to demonstrate his leadership and remind the public that he\u2019s is the only one who can get us through these trying times.\n\nAnother fact is that Netanyahu has taken the most extreme stances on how to address the coronavirus crisis; that is, the most extreme after Moshe Bar Siman Tov, the director general of the Health Ministry who would be glad to put the entire Israeli economy on an emergency footing.\n\nThose who have taken part in meetings on the crisis say that the prime minister almost always sides with Bar Siman Tov on taking the most draconian measures. It\u2019s on Netanyahu\u2019s authority that these moves are adopted.\n\nThere are those who believe that \u201che really cares that there could be thousands of deaths here and that the health care system could collapse.\u201d And there are those who believe that Netanyahu is indulging in cynical, self-serving maneuvering.\n\nOpen gallery view Paramedics en route to perform a coronavirus test in Jerusalem, March 16, 2020.

But that\u2019s not Netanyahu\u2019s style. He usually prefers to keep all the authority and responsibility in his own hands to show that he\u2019s the supreme leader whose authority is unquestioned.\n\nBut that\u2019s the style of the most problematic leaders. The truth is, it might be more reassuring if Gantz were at the top of the pyramid right now, employing the teamwork that the army uses in an emergency situation.\n\nWith Netanyahu in charge, senior officials have repeatedly been asking why the National Security Council is managing the coronavirus crisis even though it has no experience with such issues. The Israel Defense Forces, in other words the Home Front Command, has been asked to manage the emergency. This makes sense based on experience in biological and chemical defense. But the Home Front Command is subordinate to the army chief of staff, who has no interest in inflating the crisis while the NSC is subordinate to the prime minister.\n\nThe events of the past week have only heightened the suspicion \u2013 and confusion \u2013 regarding the prime minister\u2019s management of the crisis. The entire weekend consultations focused on the Health Ministry\u2019s wanting to declare a state of emergency and effectively shut down the economy.\n\nMinistry officials presented worrying scenarios of an unstoppable epidemic and tens of thousands of deaths if anything less was done. Against forecasts like these, officials from other ministries could offer no real alternative, especially out of fear that if the situation really did deteriorate they would be held responsible.\n\nOpen gallery view A falafel stand in Tel Aviv, March 16, 2020.

The deliberations of the Financial Stability Committee \u2013 the panel chaired by Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron for handling economy-wide emergencies \u2013 are secret, but TheMarker has learned that in its first meeting the committee opposed measures that would bring the economy to a standstill.\n\nThe committee feared that extreme measures could cost the economy 7% of GDP, or about 100 billion shekels ($27.3 billion), rising unemployment and failed businesses. It could set off panic buying at the supermarkets and pharmacies and, worst of all, a run on the banks.\n\nA situation like that could easily turn into a financial crisis against which Israel\u2019s defenses \u2013 big foreign currency reserves, a low ratio of debt to GDP and full employment \u2013 would be ineffective. An economic crisis of such proportions would take a toll on human life by rising levels of clinical depression, suicides and the collapse of social-support systems.\n\nThe committee\u2019s opposition turned out to be the critical factor. Despite their reported hesitation, Finance Ministry officials feared to oppose the Health Ministry and let Netanyahu make the decision. In the end, Netanyahu decided against a full lockdown of the economy and settled for partial measures. But a lockdown remains a possibility in the near future.\n\nDoes this make the case that Netanyahu has no conflicts of interest and considers the economy more important than his personal interests? There\u2019s no simple answer. But the fact that the question is being asked so often contributes to the distrust of the decision-making process and Netanyahu\u2019s role in it.\n\nAlmost all the officials who took part in the weekend deliberations have to ask themselves whether the prime minister\u2019s hands are really clean in this matter. It\u2019s another good reason why power shouldn\u2019t be in the hands of a person under criminal indictment \u2013 all the more so in a crisis when each decision has wide-ranging and immediate implications."}}
