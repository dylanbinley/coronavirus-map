Relying on his carefully cultivated chemistry with Trump, Macron shuttled between high-level official meetings in a conference center barricaded by security to a small room in the town hall filled with European and Iranian diplomats.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nG7 leaders end summit with a focus on U.S-China trade tensions, climate, Iran\n\nMacron, who is known to exchange casual texts with Trump, kept him in the loop minute by minute, both men said as they stood together on stage, recounting the weekend. They embraced at least once before going their separate ways.\n\nTheir joint news conference capped an unexpectedly dramatic gathering normally known for bland public expressions of unity and no small amount of sharp exchanges behind closed doors.\n\nMacron said he hoped Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani could meet within weeks in hopes of saving the 2015 nuclear deal that Tehran struck with world powers, but which the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from last year. Under the deal, Iran agreed to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.\n\nWATCH: Trump rejects compensating Iran, says line of credit a possibility\n\nTrump was less definitive about a time frame for such a meeting with Rouhani.\n\n\u201cIf the circumstances were correct or right, I would certainly agree to that. But in the meantime, they have to be good players. You understand what that means,\u201d Trump said of the Iranians.\n\nHe later added, \u201cAt a given point in time, there will have to be a meeting between the American and Iranian president.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nIran\u2019s foreign minister makes surprise visit to French town hosting G7 summit\n\nTrump suggested offering lines of credit to Iran, giving it access to much needed hard currency amid re-imposed U.S. sanctions crippling its economy. Moments later, he repeated his criticism of former President Barack Obama over his agreement to release large sums of cash to Iran to partially settle a claim over a 1970s military equipment order.\n\nThis time, Trump said, Iran was ready to deal. Certainly Macron and the other G-7 leaders, who opposed Trump\u2019s decision to unilaterally leave the accord, have been hoping Trump also was ready.\n\nMacron, who had met Friday with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Paris, intercepted Trump as he arrived at his Biarritz hotel the following day, and the two spent nearly two hours alone together on a sunny terrace, eating and talking before the summit\u2019s official start. Trump seemed almost smitten at the memory.\n\nWATCH: U.K. PM Boris Johnson says Iran has opportunity to come back into nuclear deal\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t trying to impress his people. I wasn\u2019t trying to impress my people. We were just trying to impress each other,\u201d he said.\n\nThat seems to be when Macron first broached the idea of the invitation. Trump said he approved, despite new U.S. sanctions against Zarif. The Iranian diplomat\u2019s plane was permitted to land at the small airport, which was open only to G-7 flights.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson, greeting Macron for a meeting Sunday morning just before the plane left Tehran, congratulated him and shook his hand.\n\n\u201cWell done. Bien jou\u00e9,\u201d Johnson said, using the French expression for \u201cwell played.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nDonald Trump puts forward his Miami golf course as location for next G7 summit\n\nBut the plan almost foundered while the plane was in the air, due to a sloppily written statement from Macron\u2019s office that said the leaders had agreed during an informal G-7 dinner Saturday that Macron could serve as an intermediary. Asked about it, Trump looked blank and denied he had agreed to anything.\n\nZarif\u2019s convoy headed to Biarritz city hall, where he met with Macron and diplomats from Britain, Germany and France, who are still parties to the nuclear deal. Trump would not say whether any Americans were present but insisted Macron had kept him informed at every step. The French president\u2019s day was fully scheduled, but he somehow carved out 30 minutes and Zarif\u2019s plane left. The Iranian tweeted minutes before takeoff: \u201cRoad ahead is difficult. But worth trying.\u201d\n\nMacron had just enough time to change into formalwear for the G-7 banquet.\n\nWATCH: G7 summit: Rifts emerge over Iran as top Iranian official makes surprise visit\n\nA French official said talks on Iran continued into Monday with a small team of diplomats who stayed behind. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations.\n\nMacron would not say how far the discussions went.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you more for the moment publicly because anything I could tell you will undermine the discussions,\u201d he said.\n\nTensions over Iran, Russia, the U.S. trade war with China and the faltering global economy dominated the three-day summit . Trump insisted the gathering was marked by absolute unity, which was true to the extent that the other leaders carefully sidestepped any differences with him.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCanada offers to help Brazil fight Amazon forest fires as flames take centre stage at G7\n\nIn a televised speech, Rouhani appeared on the defensive, shielding his foreign minister against criticism from hard-liners who have rejected negotiations until sanctions are lifted.\n\n\u201cIf I knew that going to a meeting and visiting a person would help my country\u2019s development and resolve the problems of the people, I would not miss it,\u201d Rouhani said. \u201cEven if the odds of success are not 90% but are 20% or 10%, we must move ahead with it. We should not miss opportunities.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s English-language Press TV issued a vague, anonymous statement Monday rejecting Macron\u2019s initiative.\n\nWATCH: Trump says Iran lying with claim it has arrested 17 CIA spies\n\nMerkel said an achievement of the G-7 summit was an agreement to block Iran from having nuclear weapons \u201cby political means.\u201d She would not list any specifics.\n\n\u201cWhat will come out of this, what possibilities will open up, we can\u2019t say today. But the firm will to talk is already great progress,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump said he was \u201cnot looking for leadership change.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Germany\u2019s Merkel says they must explore all ways to reduce Iran tensions\n\n\u201cWe are looking for no nuclear weapons, no ballistic missiles and a longer period of time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u00a9 2019 The Canadian Press"}}
