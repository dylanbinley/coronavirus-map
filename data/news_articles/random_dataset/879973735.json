House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) is set to attend, her first meeting with the president since she kicked off the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAdministration opposition to the Turkish assault has heightened since Mr. Trump on Oct. 6 ordered a U.S. withdrawal from northeastern Syria in a statement that said the U.S. \u201cwill not support\u201d the incursion. After bipartisan political criticism, U.S. officials on Friday threatened sanctions if Turkey didn\u2019t agree to a cease-fire, and imposed some of the measures on Monday.\n\nGet news and analysis on politics, policy, national security and more, delivered right to your inbox\n\nAs roughly 1,000 U.S. troops work their way out of Syria, American forces Tuesday put on a show of force when members of a Turkish-backed militia came dangerously close to a U.S. position, officials said. American F-15 fighters and Apache attack helicopters flew overhead, and the Turkish-backed force retreated. No shots were fired on either side, officials said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a volatile, dangerous situation and we are focused on doing an orderly and deliberate withdrawal\u2026with the number one priority being the protection of our forces,\u201d an official said.\n\nAs U.S. troops departed, Russian forces were patrolling the line between Turkish and Syrian armies in and around the city of Manbij, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said, demonstrating the country\u2019s growing role as a power broker in the multisided conflict. American forces have left the city, a U.S. military spokesman said, as part of a broader pullout from northeast Syria, where they had joined with Kurdish allies in a coalition fighting Islamic State.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump withdrew from that partnership, Kurdish fighters in the area sought to shield themselves from a week-old Turkish offensive by striking an alliance with the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which is backed by Russia and Iran.\n\nSyrian military convoys have begun moving into positions across the northeast of the country, where the army had only a token presence since the start of the war.\n\nU.S. officials acknowledged the arrival of the Syrian and Russian forces into areas that had been under U.S. control only a week ago. Some of them are now in proximity to Turkish forces, a senior Trump administration official said.\n\nThe movement of Russian troops and the departure of American forces from the area have led both sides to use a military deconfliction channel that had been set up by U.S. and Russian commanders, the official said. As of Tuesday, the number of Russian military forces near Manbij was relatively small, \u201cnot even hundreds,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe U.S. pullback has created an opening for Moscow to expand its clout in a region dominated for decades by American influence but now unsettled by Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and his stated desire to disengage from the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThe Russians think of themselves as the natural player in the grand design of the geopolitics of the region,\u201d said Malik R. Dahlan, a Saudi lawyer and senior fellow at the Harvard University Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.\n\nThe U.S. departure smooths Russia\u2019s way to ensure it retains control over much of Syria\u2019s natural resources. Russia\u2019s decision to intervene was heavily influenced by the investments Moscow had made there since Soviet times.\n\nBefore the Syrian war, Russian companies had invested more than $10 billion to build gas-processing facilities, pipelines and pump oil. That activity stopped as fighting raged, and Syrian oil assets had traded hands in the heaviest years of fighting and at one point were controlled by Kurdish groups and protected by U.S. troops.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has showed a willingness to foster friendships of his own with U.S. allies as well as its adversaries. He has developed strong ties not only with Mr. Assad, but also with Mr. Erdogan, whose country is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nMr. Putin arrived on Tuesday in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, where Russian officials said they planned to sign 10 investment agreements valued at a total of $1.3 billion. Russia signed billions of dollars in deals a day earlier in Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. ally that for decades had been a Cold War adversary of Moscow.\n\nSuch traditional U.S. allies are grappling with Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to scale back Washington\u2019s footprint in the region. After the U.S. troop withdrawal in Syria paved the way for the Turkish offensive, Mr. Erdogan said Turkey had seized significant territory, now controlling about 386 square miles of territory in northeastern Syria. He said Turkey would continue to press the campaign to secure an area about 10 times larger between Manbij and the Iraqi border.\n\n\u201cWe will continue our struggle until the north of Syria is green again,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said in a televised speech from Baku, Azerbaijan.\n\nMoscow said it would prevent any serious conflicts from erupting between Syrian government forces and Turkish troops. \u201cIt\u2019s not that no one is interested in conflict, it\u2019s unacceptable, and therefore we won\u2019t allow it,\u201d said Alexander Lavrentiev, Russia\u2019s special envoy to the Syria crisis, Russian news agency Interfax reported.\n\nMr. Lavrentiev said Moscow hoped the U.S. would soon pull all of its forces out of the country. \u201cRegardless of Trump\u2019s statements about the withdrawal of U.S. troops in two weeks, it\u2019s hard to say what the final result will be,\u201d Interfax reported him as saying. \u201cBut there\u2019s hope.\u201d\n\nRussia has long criticized the presence of the U.S. in Syria, where it allied with Kurdish fighters who were seeking self-rule. Russia entered at Mr. Assad\u2019s request in 2015 to help roll back the gains of antigovernment rebels.\n\nOne battle in February 2018 saw the U.S. kill a number of Russian mercenaries who were likely fighting for a pro-Assad militia.\n\nThe latest phase of the eight-year Syrian conflict threatens to unleash a wave of refugees. Iraq is bracing for an influx of as many as a quarter of a million people. The semiautonomous Kurdistan region in northern Iraq already hosts more than 200,000 refugees from Syria. Around 450 people have crossed the border from Syria in the past two days, authorities in northern Iraq said.\n\nTurkey\u2019s incursion has displaced some 130,000 people from their homes in northeast Syria since it began one week ago, the United Nations said. The majority have remained within the country, moving away from the border to seek sanctuary from the fighting.\n\nThe U.S. has evacuated a small contingent of American diplomats and began relocating troops from smaller front-line bases to larger ones that are easier to defend or father from the fighting.\n\nMr. Trump has dismissed criticism for exposing a U.S. ally with his decision to pull troops from Syria. On Monday, he authorized sanctions and raised steel tariffs on Turkey, threatening more-powerful financial penalties unless Ankara halted its offensive.\n\nAt least 71 civilians have been killed in Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The group said six of them were executed by Turkish-backed fighters along the M4 highway running along the border. A senior Trump administration official on Tuesday attributed the executions to Turkish-supported Syrian opposition elements being used by Ankara as part of its military assault.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish Armed Forces and the Syrian National Army are conducting an extremely meticulous operation without inflicting even slightest harm to civilians,\u201d the Turkish presidency\u2019s communications department said on Tuesday.\n\nAnkara could have employed traditional military units to conduct its operation, the official said, but \u201cinstead they decided to use these thugs and bandits and pirates that should be wiped off the face of the earth.\u201d The unit affiliated with those killings is \u201ca well-known jihadist element,\u201d the official added.\n\nTurkey has long relied on such Syrian proxy groups, as it did in 2016 and 2018 when Ankara launched its two previous military offensives in Syria. For years, U.S. officials had rejected demands that American forces work with Turkey\u2019s Syrian proxies because of U.S. concerns about their links to extremist groups and questions about their professionalism.\n\nPentagon officials said they have \u201csignificant concerns\u201d about the militias backed by Turkey. \u201cThe Turks have committed to us that they will have control over those forces, but it\u2019s a continued concern, especially after you unleash a force like that,\u201d the official said.\n\n\u201cIn terms of counterterrorism, we have never been subjected to a double standard as the one we are now facing in Syria,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said.\n\nFor the U.S., \u201cgoal No. 1 is to carry out diplomacy, to try to find a cease-fire and get the situation under control,\u201d a senior Trump administration official said, citing the current confusion and risk to U.S. troops, the fight against Islamic State, the detention of nearly 10,000 prisoners, and the management of internally displaced persons camps.\n\nThe official denounced Ankara\u2019s suggestions that the U.S. had provided Kurdish-led forces in Syria with heavy weapons, saying it has given the Syrian Democratic Forces mainly small arms and mortars.\n\nRussia\u2019s taking the place of U.S. troops in northeast Syria surprised even some of its security officials as to how quickly Moscow emerged with a commanding position in the conflict.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unusual development in our relationship with the U.S. to see Washington voluntarily hand over a territory to a Russian sphere of influence,\u201d said Fyodor Lukyanov, head of a Kremlin defense and foreign-policy advisory board. \u201cBut we\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\nCorrections & Amplifications Russia\u2019s military entered the Syrian conflict in 2015.
