The general\u2019s departure came with headlines but little surprise. His resignation letter omitted any praise for the commander-in-chief. \u201cBecause you have the right to have a secretary of defense whose views are better aligned with yours,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI believe it is right for me to step down.\u201d\n\nMattis details differences with Trump over Nato allies and torture in new book Read more\n\nMattis had been on thin ice for a long time. At an infamous cabinet meeting in June 2017, Mattis praised the men and women of the military instead of gushing over the president. Just months later, a White House official told me Mattis had shown insufficient loyalty to Trump. But because North Korea was on the front burner \u2013 before \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d had started sending Trump love letters \u2013 the president felt he needed generals around him. In the end, everyone in Trump\u2019s orbit is expendable. Except Ivanka Trump.\n\nCall Sign Chaos, Mattis\u2019s memoir, is a readable look at more than four decades as a marine. Co-written with Bing West, a former marine and Reagan Pentagon alumnus, the book spans Mattis\u2019s career, from enlistment through retirement.\n\nIt contains veiled disapproval of Trump and is sharper in expressing disagreements with his Oval Office predecessors.\n\nCall Sign Chaos takes aim at bigotry and lauds the military service of migrants. It gives full-throated support for Nato\n\nOfficially, the book\u2019s title derives from the call-sign bestowed when Mattis became a regimental commander, Chaos an acronym for \u201cColonel Has An Outstanding Solution\u201d.\n\nMattis comes across as plain-spoken and reflective, a fan of books and history. Abraham Lincoln and Gettysburg receive their due. As a younger man, however, Mattis was not above brawling. In other words, he\u2019s interesting.\n\nHe repeatedly expresses his regard for America\u2019s institutions and its constitution even as he offers criticism, one thing which sets him apart from the 45th president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve developed a love affair with our constitution,\u201d Mattis writes.\n\nHe tells of getting into a fight in Montana with three other men. Then 19, he was rewarded with a brief jail sentence and a sheriff\u2019s escort to a westbound freight train. His brush with the law became a formative experience.\n\nMattis recalls that as a marine recruiter he was confronted with a prospect who had been arrested for a \u201csingle use of cocaine\u201d. Channeling his inner Nick Saban on the value of \u201csecond chances\u201d, Mattis pushed for a waiver. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference,\u201d he writes, \u201cbetween making a mistake and letting that mistake define you.\u201d\n\nAs Mattis moved up the ranks, interaction with Congress, the White House and civilian Pentagon leadership became a norm, although not necessarily a welcome one. Mattis professes to prefer the field and his troops. DC was not his \u201ccup of tea\u201d. Yet he appears to have overcome that hurdle, to a point anyway, when he was appointed executive secretary to Bill Clinton\u2019s defense chiefs, William Perry and William Cohen.\n\n\u201cI gained an abiding respect for those with whom I served and from whom I also learned a new skill set,\u201d he writes. \u201cI had a front-row seat to policymaking as it was supposed to work.\u201d\n\nAs for congressional oversight and the power of the purse, Mattis \u201creceived a pragmatic introduction to article one of the constitution\u201d, a reminder to the reader that it is Congress that is tasked with raising America\u2019s armed forces.\n\nMattis saw action in Afghanistan and Iraq. He blames Tommy Franks, head of US Central Command and an army general, for Osama bin Laden\u2019s escape from Tora Bora, his refusal to deploy the marines a key cause of that debacle. As Mattis frames things: \u201cWe in the military missed the opportunity, not the president, who properly deferred to his senior military commander on how to carry out the mission.\u201d\n\nBut Iraq was a different story, and there Mattis places blame squarely on George W Bush for getting the US into the mess, and on Barack Obama and Joe Biden for the mode of the eventual pullback. As for going to war, Mattis observes: \u201cInvading Iraq stunned me. Why were we fighting them again?\u201d\n\nFor Mattis, Iran was an implacable foe. He also believes Tehran came to view the Obama administration as 'impotent'\n\nIn a chapter titled Incoherence, Mattis acidly mocks and quotes Bush 43\u2019s Freedom Agenda. These days, Iraq is ranked \u201cnot free\u201d by Freedom House. Irony abounds.\n\nHe commends Obama for his intelligence and reserve and Biden for his warmth. Yet he tags them over the pullout from Iraq, Obama\u2019s imaginary red line in Syria and their stance toward Iran. He does not mask his disapproval.\n\nFor Mattis, Iran was an implacable foe. He also believes Tehran came to view the Obama administration as \u201cimpotent\u201d. To the general, proof positive lay in the failure to respond to an Iranian plot to bomb Cafe Milano, a restaurant just miles from the White House, and assassinate the Saudi ambassador.\n\nMattis also takes aim at WikiLeaks, describing it as \u201cnew kind of adversary\u201d that \u201cinflicted deep harm\u201d to American interests. Unlike Trump, he never harbored any love for Julian Assange\u2019s creation.\n\nTo Mattis, American uncertainty and messianism can both have steep downsides. As he saw it, an absence of strategy would engender the sense that the US was \u201cproving unreliable.\u201d\n\nTrouble in paradise: Trump attacks Fox News \u2013 and Fox News hits back Read more\n\n\u201cI was disappointed and frustrated,\u201d he writes. \u201cPolicymakers all too often failed to deliver clear direction.\u201d\n\nYet Mattis does not grapple with domestic political realities. Lives and treasure aside, Iraq cost the Republicans both houses of Congress in 2006 and paved the way for Obama. Furthermore, casualty counts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were factors in Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat. Not everything is about Russia.\n\nWhen it comes to Trump, Mattis flanks, avoiding a head-on clash. Call Sign Chaos takes aim at bigotry and lauds the military service of migrants. As in his resignation letter, Mattis gives full-throated support for Nato: \u201cNations with allies thrive, and those without wither.\u201d\n\nIn his epilogue, Mattis notes America\u2019s political divide and full-throated tribalism. But he is optimistic. Call Sign Chaos ends thus: \u201cE Pluribus Unum.\u201d"}}
