There, the wife informed a staff member that her husband had left South Africa for Germany on 14 March.\n\nBut, on the same day, the Department of Health was informed that the husband of the woman and father to the child had \u201crefused to be tested for possibly being infected with Covid-19\u201d.\n\nAn investigation by the Department of Home Affairs revealed the man was still in South Africa, having arrived in the country on 8 September 2017.\n\nThe mother and child had provided the private hospital with a history of being in contact with a carrier of Covid-19 in Germany.\n\nAfter blood tests were taken from the mother and child on 13 March, they were sent home to self-isolate. On 15 March, the tests returned positive and they were advised to self-isolate immediately.\n\n\u201cIn keeping with my functions at the hospital, I informed the Department of Health, the National Institute of Communicable Diseases of the fact that the first and second respondents had tested positively for Covid-19,\u201d said the nurse in her affidavit.\n\nA doctor in the emergency unit had informed the nurse that the husband had refused to be consulted when he had brought his wife and child to the hospital on 13 March.\n\nOn 16 March, the woman and child returned to the private hospital where they were treated in an isolation ward.\n\nOn her return to the hospital on 16 March, the woman had told the nurse that her husband had not accompanied her on 13 March when they first tested, clearly an untruth and contradicting the emergency unit doctor\u2019s report.\n\nOn 17 March 2020, Judge Sharise Weiner ordered that the mother and child \u201cbe quarantined at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital until such time that the Department of Health is satisfied the First and Second Respondents do not pose a risk of transmission of C0vid-19 to the public\u201d.\n\nSAPS were ordered to trace the father and he was located shortly afterwards. The family remains in quarantine. DM"}}
