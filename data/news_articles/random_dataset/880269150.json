The local woman's grandmother traveled to Chitral to meet the princess during her visit to Pakistan in 1991.\n\n\"Princess Diana was visiting at around the time she was born, which is why she got named Diana,\" a translator explained. \"And now her son is now William. Her grandmother went to meet Princess Diana in Chitral, her mum was unable to travel because she was expecting her.\"\n\nDiana is living up to her namesake's legacy of selflessness and giving; the young woman is part of the emergency response team of volunteers\u2014now funded by U.K. aid\u2014that worked to prevent loss of life during the 2015 floods.\n\n\"They generally spoke about where these guys were in 2015 floods, what their reactions were, what they felt, conversations around that,\" the translator explained, describing the discussion Will and Kate had with the group of locals. \"They're glad that people are learning more about this. It's a source of pride. They can't forget this day.\"\n\n\n\nDuring the discussion, William asked (through a translator) about the group's experiences during the 2015 flood.\n\n\"Was it quite scary? What kind of time of day did it happen?\" William asked. \"Was it like a big roar in the valley?\"\n\nThe royal couple also watched a demonstration by a local search and rescue team, who showed the duke and duchess how they transport casualties across a river.\n\nThe Sun's royal correspondent, Emily Andrews, described the intimate meeting as the most \"real\" event the Cambridges have done during their tour.\n\nThis content is imported from Twitter.
