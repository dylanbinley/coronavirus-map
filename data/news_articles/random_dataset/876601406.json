Well, part of it.\n\nThe Racine City Council voted Monday evening to change the name of the waterfront street to Kipi Kawi Causeway \u2014 or possibly KipiKawi or Kipikawi, as officials haven\u2019t decided on the final spelling yet. Kipi Kawi is what the native Potawatomi called the Root River.\n\nHowever, since the city only controls approximately 400 feet of the causeway (extending east from Fourth Street past Lake Avenue), only that section of the road will be renamed. A resolution is being forwarded by the city to the county, requesting that the county follow suit and rename the rest of the road.\n\nAt first, the resolution that went before the council Monday requested to change the name to the \u201cRoot River Causeway,\u201d but 9th District Alderman Trevor Jung requested to have the name be the Kipi Kawi Causeway instead because the new name would \u201chonor indigenous people.\u201d\n\nThird District Alderman John Tate II also said that naming the road after the Root River would be \u201ccelebrating things that are actually about our city. Christopher Columbus never actually stepped foot in Racine.\u201d\n\nCity staff estimated the cost of the change would be $500."}}
