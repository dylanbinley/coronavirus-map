California tightened its vaccine requirements last fall despite protests during which anti-vaccine activists threw blood on state senators, assaulted the vaccine bill\u2019s sponsor and shut down the legislature.\n\nNow, many of these same vaccine critics are joining a fight against stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus, which had killed more than 47,000 Americans as of Thursday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThis is just a fresh coat of paint for the anti-vaccine movement in America, and an exploitative means for them to try to remain relevant,\u201d said Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n\nHotez said anti-vaccine groups are seizing on the anti-government sentiment stoked by conservative-leaning protesters to advance their cause.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, their strategy may work.\u201d\n\nA group calling itself the Freedom Angels, whose members last year stood on chairs and chanted at public hearings on the California vaccine bill, say governors are abusing their power by shutting down gun shops and other businesses.\n\nMany anti-vaccine activists \u2014 who have claimed that diseases such as measles aren\u2019t that serious \u2014 now contend the coronavirus isn\u2019t dangerous enough to justify staying home. They agree with President Donald Trump that the \u201ccure\u201d for the pandemic could be worse than the disease itself.\n\nThat\u2019s led some vaccine foes to join the protesters \u2014 whom Trump has encouraged on Twitter \u2014 in staging demonstrations in state capitals to \u201creopen America.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the time for people to take notice and really evaluate the freedoms they\u2019re giving up, all in the name of perceived safety,\u201d said Freedom Angels co-founder Heidi Munoz Gleisner in a Facebook video.\n\nThe group organized a Monday rally in Sacramento called \u201cOperation Gridlock.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople need to get back to work, get back to life, get back into contact with their loved ones who they\u2019re isolated from, they need to be able to have a paycheck,\u201d group co-founder Tara Thornton told The Sacramento Bee, which interviewed her during the demonstration. \u201cThis is the grounds they will enslave us upon.\u201d\n\nFreedom Angels did not respond to requests for interviews. The group\u2019s website mentions plans for additional rallies and includes photos from Monday\u2019s demonstration, such as one in which a protester holds a sign proclaiming \u201cNo Mandatory Vaccines.\u201d\n\nBut after the Monday event, the California Highway Patrol announced it had revoked the group\u2019s permit for future protests because the gathering \u2014 which included dozens of people \u2014 violated the governor\u2019s social distancing order. The highway patrol has now banned all group events at the Capitol during the pandemic to avoid spreading the coronavirus.\n\nA big tent\n\nThe anti-vaccine movement has never been limited to one political party. Left-leaning vaccine critics \u2014 such as Children\u2019s Health Defense, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 include environmentalists who are suspicious of chemical pollutants, corporations and \u201cBig Pharma.\u201d The Kennedy group\u2019s website attacks Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, for rushing \u201crisky and uncertain coronavirus vaccines\u201d into development as part of a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d for drug companies.\n\nOn the other side of the political spectrum, many anti-vaccine conservatives oppose state immunization requirements because they distrust \u201cbig government.\u201d\n\nA group called Texans for Vaccine Choice has called on the governor to promise that no one will be forced to get a coronavirus vaccine in order to go to work or school.\n\nPosts on the Facebook page of Californians for Health Choice, which also opposed California\u2019s vaccine laws, question stay-at-home orders and accuse government officials of refusing to admit the orders are a mistake.\n\nIn a video on the Freedom Angels\u2019 Facebook page, its founders describe stay-at-home orders as an abuse of government authority, and the closure of California gun shops as an assault on the Second Amendment. The group notes that guns could be essential for protection from rioters and looters looking to steal food during the pandemic.\n\nIn many ways, the conservative arm of the anti-vaccine movement is a natural ally for those leading \u201creopen America\u201d rallies, said Dr. David Gorski, an oncologist and managing editor of the Science-Based Medicine site. Both harbor suspicions about government authority.\n\nVaccine critics, for example, have long championed the false claim that vaccines cause autism, and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tried to cover up that information, Gorski said. Trump has at times linked vaccines with autism, although he came out strongly in favor of vaccinations during the 2019 measles epidemic.\n\nAnti-vaccine groups are now rebranding themselves as advocates of \u201cmedical freedom,\u201d\n\nProtests against social distancing began in Michigan but have spread to state capitols in Texas, Colorado, Nevada, Maryland, Wisconsin and elsewhere, with more planned. Most protests have been small, limited to a few hundred or fewer people.\n\nYet the anti-vaccine movement doesn\u2019t speak for everyone on the right.\n\nStephen Moore, the senior economic contributor for FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group that has been helping publicize the protests, said he\u2019s unfamiliar with the Freedom Angels or their rallies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m personally pro-vaccine,\u201d said Moore, a member of the White House council to reopen the economy. \u201cEspecially when it comes to coronavirus.\u201d\n\nAnd some heroes of the anti-vaccine movement say they support coronavirus lockdowns.\n\nDr. Jay Gordon, a Santa Monica, California, pediatrician popular among vaccine foes for downplaying the risks of measles, said the risk of COVID-19 is real. Gordon said he approves of the lockdown, \u201cand we have to keep it up.\u201d\n\nContaining the pandemic\n\nDr. Richard Pan, a pediatrician and California state senator who has championed stronger vaccine mandates, described anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown protesters as \u201cessentially selfish\u201d because they put other people at risk.\n\n\u201cOne of the hallmarks of the anti-vaccine movement is this sense of selfishness and lack of concern for other people\u2019s health,\u201d Pan said. \u201cThey like to talk about rights and freedom. But what they really want is freedom without consequences.\u201d\n\nBoth anti-vaccine parents and those who want to relax social distancing assume that the medical system will come to their rescue if they become sick, said Pan, who noted that thousands of health care workers have died while fighting the pandemic.\n\nFauci has said that relaxing stay-at-home orders is dangerous as long as the virus \u2014 for which there are no approved treatments or vaccines \u2014 is actively spreading. Reopening businesses too soon could spark a second wave of infections.\n\nMore than 75 companies and research groups worldwide are trying to develop vaccines, which are seen as a key weapon against the novel coronavirus.\n\nIn the meantime, the CDC says that social distancing measures \u2014 such as working from home and avoiding large gatherings \u2014 are critical to slowing the spread of the coronavirus and preventing patients from overwhelming hospitals. Health leaders say it won\u2019t be safe to reopen the county until widespread testing shows the coronavirus has died down.\n\nAmericans overwhelmingly support vaccination, according to surveys, and polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 80% of Americans want lockdowns to continue. Only 19% said social distancing orders placed an unnecessary burden on the economy. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\nNeither the anti-vaccine nor anti-lockdown demonstrators represent the opinions of most Americans, Pan said.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put this movement into proper context,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re loud, they\u2019re noisy and they\u2019re small.\u201d"}}
