In Everything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay, his comedy on Freeform (the Disney-owned channel geared to teens), he can be explicit about the positioning of the bodies, with one man on top of another, legs splayed, after they banter about whether one of them can get hard and who can grab the lube and a condom. Then he can show the face of the person who is being penetrated. \u201cThere\u2019s a process of going through the standards-and-practices rules,\u201d Thomas says, \u201cand working out what I can do that lets us get away with stuff.\u201d\n\nEverything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay is Thomas\u2019s first American TV series, and his follow-up to Please Like Me, a somewhat autobiographical comedy of floundering Australian 20-somethings. Both are filled with gay characters whose neuroses, obsessions with well-plated meals, and, of course, sex lives stem from Thomas\u2019s own life and observations of those around him. The new series weds his fondness for sweetly cringe-inducing comedy to the structure of a more traditional family sitcom, centered on an older sibling abruptly saddled with more responsibility than he expects he can handle. (The series premiered in mid-January, but older episodes are streaming on Hulu.)\n\nPlease Like Me snuck into the States via the now-defunct network Pivot, but it earned enough cult attention to allow Thomas to pitch the new show to Freeform. Which brings us back to anal sex. \u201cI\u2019m not, like, an easy guy to have on a call if you want to reduce the amount of anal sex in a thing,\u201d Thomas says, recalling the one (and so far only) time an American TV executive asked if he needed to include a shot of a character with his legs up. \u201cI didn\u2019t even let her finish the sentence. I was like, \u2018Yes, you need that shot because that shot signifies that they are doing anal sex. And gay sex is anal sex. And if you\u2019re telling me that I can\u2019t show anal sex, you\u2019re telling me I can\u2019t show gay sex.\u2019 \u201d Thomas is impassioned in the retelling, a change of pace from his typically casual, self-deprecating demeanor. \u201cShe was like, \u2018I\u2019m just asking!\u2019 \u201d He laughs and says, \u201cThey never brought it up again.\u201d\n\nThomas is telling me this anecdote as we huddle on the upper level of an NYC sightseeing bus, both of us shivering but pretending to not be. Thomas had suggested a sightseeing tour, but thanks to my own incompetence, we ended up on a bus service without an in-person guide. When we put on our headphones, the prerecorded audio is transitioning out of a segment on 9/11 and into a tinny recording of \u201cEmpire State of Mind.\u201d \u201cOh no,\u201d Thomas says, \u201cthis is the wrong bus tour.\u201d It feels appropriate for the tone of his comedy, like something that might happen on one of his shows.\n\nThe 32-year-old Aussie, who\u2019s wearing vintage sunglasses and a dyed blue-purple coat he describes as \u201ca whole sheep,\u201d likes scenarios that veer from shambolic into sweet. The first episode of Please Like Me kicks off with his character\u2019s girlfriend dumping him because she\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s gay and follows that up with his mom\u2019s attempted suicide. Things do not necessarily improve from there, even if everyone involved keeps a sense of humor. \u201cSorry about your life,\u201d Josh tells his friend Tom in the series\u2019 final exchange. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your life,\u201d Tom answers.\n\nBoth shows star Thomas as a less competent version of himself, in the vein of Girls\u2019 Hannah Horvath or Curb Your Enthusiasm\u2019s Larry David, focusing the comedy on experiences that other series might handle with Very Special Episodes: Several Please Like Me characters lived with mental illness and Everything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay opens with a father\u2019s death, leaving Thomas\u2019s character to take care of his teenage half-sisters, one of whom is autistic.\n\nWe\u2019ve set off from a stop in the Financial District after missing one bus thanks to Thomas running late (he\u2019d messaged me \u201cI\u2019M SORRY\u201d over Twitter), and stocking up for the journey with some stale Pop-Tarts at a kiosk across the street (neither of us had tried them untoasted).\n\nThomas started writing the new series out of an interest in revisiting high school, having already mined most of his 20s for Please Like Me. He was nominally straight in high school\u2014\u201cIn my old stand-up, I used to say, \u2018Yeah, I used to have sex with girls, and once when I was 13, I tried to fuck a watermelon\u2019 \u201d\u2014and sees versions of his teenage self represented in Everything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay\u2019s younger characters.\n\nThomas decided to write a character with autism primarily because he hadn\u2019t seen the experience represented well onscreen before. \u201cI was interested in how little I knew about [autism], and how little everyone that I know knew about it,\u201d he says. \u201cThose characters are always geniuses who come in and solve problems and leave; it\u2019s rare for them to have interpersonal relationships [onscreen],\u201d he says. His character\u2019s sister Matilda, who has high-functioning autism, gets drunk, fights with her friends, and acts on her sexual desires. For research, Thomas interviewed teenage girls on the spectrum, and read books and watched videos on the subject, including a Ted Talk by Alix Generous, a woman with Asperger\u2019s who became a consultant on the series. The idea that someone on the spectrum would do well with public speaking became a plot point, when Matilda excels at giving a eulogy at her father\u2019s funeral, full of the kinds of bleak jokes that have become Thomas\u2019s specialty. (\u201cDad used to get frustrated when I always made things about myself,\u201d Matilda starts her speech, \u201cbut he is dead now. Surprise!\u201d)\n\nMatilda is played by Kayla Cromer, an actress who is on the spectrum. Thomas wanted to cast someone with autism to play the lead part, in defiance of TV\u2019s history of having neurotypical actors play characters on the spectrum (as in Atypical or The Good Doctor). He and his collaborators initially weren\u2019t sure if it would be possible to find an actor with autism who could carry a leading role on a series, but quickly discovered that there were \u201cheaps of girls\u201d who could play the part. Matilda also takes classes with other kids on the spectrum, allowing Thomas to depict a range of autistic experiences, and to make it clear that Matilda\u2019s specific attributes aren\u2019t universal.\n\nDoes he worry about getting it wrong? \u201cIt\u2019s a community that\u2019s had such little representation, and you get very nervous that you\u2019re going to fuck their representation up, because it means so much to them,\u201d he says. \u201cBut my experience with the community is that they\u2019re very understanding.\u201d\n\nBy this point in our journey around Manhattan, Thomas and I have decided to abandon ship, get off our (still empty) tour bus, and take refuge in a nearby bakery, where it will be warm and we can drink coffee. As we make our way over, Thomas compares the pressure he feels in representing autism on television to the way he often got asked about depicting gay characters on Please Like Me. \u201cIt always annoyed me a bit when I would get praised for not making the guys too camp,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think people would say that anymore.\u201d\n\nHe has a way of being self-deprecating when he talks about representation, even though it\u2019s clear how important it is to him. On Please Like Me, in addition to depicting gay relationships with nuance \u2014 and, yes, sex \u2014 Thomas paid careful attention to the way the show portrays experiences with depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\nWe\u2019ve made it into the bakery, and Thomas is nursing a cappuccino with an extra shot, slowly warming himself up from our tour-bus misadventure. His characters try to act with good intentions but fumble in important situations, he says, because that\u2019s the way he tends to react. And even though the characters he plays tend to make a mess of things, fans sometimes assume Thomas is an expert. \u201cSometimes people want to have meaningful conversations about the topics in my shows, and I don\u2019t really want to when I\u2019m out at a bar,\u201d he says, \u201cand sometimes they\u2019re a bit surprised that I don\u2019t really want to talk about it, or don\u2019t talk about it that well.\u201d If his shows are honest and specific about \u201ctopics,\u201d as Thomas air-quotes, it\u2019s because the writing comes from an honest and specific understanding of how easy it is to get those topics wrong. \u201cThe show is always about just being lost,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen somebody thinks I\u2019m gonna know how to solve their problem, I\u2019m like, \u2018No, that\u2019s the whole point! I don\u2019t know.\u2019 \u201d\n\n*A version of this article appears in the February 17, 2020, issue of New York Magazine. Subscribe Now!"}}
