It would give tribal leaders a voice in the hiring process. School Board Member Diane Gubatayo said it\u2019s an issue close to her heart.\n\n\u201c20 years ago, I ran \u2014 my first term on the board had to do with the native dropout rate,\u201d Gubatayo said during Wednesday night\u2019s meeting. \u201cAnd unfortunately, it has improved, but not nearly enough. The historical trauma that some people reference is very real.\u201d\n\nSchool Board President Matt Eisenhower and Interim Superintendent Beth Lougee will discuss the draft agreement with Ketchikan Indian Community\u2019s tribal council during its next meeting.\n\nIn other business, board members voted unanimously to transfer nearly $900,000 into its health insurance reserve fund to alleviate a shortfall. The district\u2019s business manager, Katie Parrott, says that deficit came from unexpected healthcare costs this year.\n\n\u201cIn the health insurance world, I\u2019ve learned,\u201d she said, \u201cthere\u2019s good years and there\u2019s bad years.\u201d\n\nParrott says the district could afford to make the transfer since it underspent its yearly budget by more than $1 million.\n\nThe school board also unanimously adopted the recommendations of the school district\u2019s health insurance task force. Those recommendations include sticking with the current insurance plan, but encouraging staff to use things like telemedicine and the district\u2019s wellness program."}}
