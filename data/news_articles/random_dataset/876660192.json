Either way, Imma be alright. I know me and what happened. You don\u2019t. So carry on. All love,\u201d he wrote.\n\nShortly after police began investigating Allen\u2019s claim, her family came forward with a statement admitting that Allen lied about her hate crime story, and apologizing to the white students who were wrongfully accused.\n\n\u201cTo those young boys and their parents, we sincerely apologize for the pain and anxiety these allegations have caused,\u201d wrote Allen\u2019s grandparents, who are her legal guardians. \u201cTo the administrators and families of Immanuel Christian School, we are sorry for the damage this incident has done to trust within the school family and the undue scorn it has brought to the school. To the broader community, who rallied in such passionate support for our daughter, we apologize for betraying your trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe understand there will be consequences and we\u2019re prepared to take responsibility for them,\u201d they added. \u201cWe know that it will take time to heal, and we hope and pray that the boys, their families, the school and the broader community will be able to forgive us in time.\u201d\n\nMaybe Smollett was right to push back on comparisons to Allen \u2014 she actually admitted her hate crime hoax and took responsibility.\n\nSmollett, however, continues to maintain that two white men wearing MAGA hats jumped him at 2AM in Chicago in January, wrapped a noose around his neck while yelling, \u201cThis is MAGA country!\u201d and pouring bleach on him.\n\nBut the extensive documented evidence of Smollett\u2019s hate hoax strongly suggests that he orchestrated the attack with two Nigerian associates who were seen in security footage purchasing the rope in order to demonize Trump supporters. The Nigerian brothers later confessed to helping Smollett craft the hoax.\n\nThe obviousness of Smollett\u2019s hate hoax resulting from the slew of evidence obtained by police in their investigation of his claim, and his refusal to come clean lead to nationwide mockery of the actor, especially after charges against him for lying to police were suddenly dropped thanks to liberal allies in high places.\n\nJuicy smooyay \ud83d\ude02 RT @RitaPanahi: Chappelle on the Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax. 24 carat gold \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/XXgy1u4Qsy \u2014 Teddy Flood. \u2693 (@_vaughny) September 4, 2019\n\nRELATED: NY TIMES REMOVES RACE CONTEXT AFTER BLACK GIRL ADMITS FAKING HATE CRIME\n\nTwitter: Follow @WhiteIsTheFury\n\nGab: https://gab.com/WhiteIsTheFury\n\nMinds: https://www.minds.com/whiteisthefury\n\nNajee Ali, a civil rights activist in Los Angeles, says Jussie Smollett could have started a race war with his allegation of a racially motivated attack.
