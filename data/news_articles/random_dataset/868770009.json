Roberts has alleged that she was procured by \u201cmadame\u201d Maxwell, 57, the daughter of disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell, as a teenage \u201csex slave\u201d for Epstein. Court docs were released hours before Epstein's death, which added to more than 2,000 files of a lawsuit pending against the former financier and his pals. The legal documents were released in a defamation case involving Roberts, who in 2015 claimed Prince Andrew slept with her three times\n\nEdwards said Epstein's \"untimely death\" was \"curious,\" adding: \"More so, it makes it absolutely impossible for the victims to ever get the day in court that they wanted, and to get full justice. That now can never happen.\"\n\nAt the hearing, Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey said the law required the dismissal of the case in light of Epstein's death, but said the government's investigation was ongoing.\n\n\"Dismissal of this indictment as to Jeffrey Epstein in no way prohibits or inhibits the government's ongoing investigation into potential co-conspirators,\" Comey said.\n\nEpstein's death has triggered probes by the FBI, the US Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General and the US Bureau of Prisons, which runs the detention facility.\n\nThe paedo\u2019s arrest in New York came more than a decade after Epstein avoided being prosecuted on similar federal charges in Florida by striking a deal that allowed him to plead guilty to state prostitution charges.\n\nThat controversial deal resulted in Epstein serving 13 months in a county jail, which he was allowed to leave during the day on work release.\n\nBrittany Henderson, a lawyer with Edwards' firm, read a statement from another victim, Michelle Licata.\n\n\"I was told then that Jeffrey Epstein was going to be held accountable, but he was not,\" she said of the earlier investigation.\n\nMOST READ IN NEWS JAWS-DROPPING SIGHT Holidaymakers stunned as shark circles waters in Devon harbour WALLIES ON THE BEAT Cops slammed for posing with 200 wedding guests and their supercars HORROR SMASH Shocking moment boy racer hits pregnant mum, 17, and her toddler at 76mph BLOW CANADA 700-mile 'Canadian vortex' to smash UK with 60mph wind...before first FROST BABY TRAGEDY Newborn baby girl found dead wrapped in beach towel at recycling centre Exclusive DOOMSDAY DOSSIER Emergency plans made for perfect storm of No Deal Brexit & Covid 2nd wave\n\n\"The case ended without me knowing what was going on. ...

She told previously of trying to swim off the Caribbean island after apparently having her passport stolen by alleged \"madam\" Ghislaine Maxwell.

What she's said: \"I was going to start this statement by saying that I was a victim of Jeffrey Epstein. \"But that's not the case. I'm still a victim of Jeffrey Epstein. \"I'm still a victim because the fear of not being heard stopped me from telling my story for so many years... \"I'm still a victim because I am fearful for my daughters and everyone's daughters... \"I'm still a victim because the 17-year-old Teala was manipulated into thinking she had found someone who cared, someone who wanted to help.\" Courtney Wild Courtney Wild claims she was sexually abused by Epstein when she was 14 in Palm Beach, Florida.

She worked as an air hostess on Epstein's private plane - dubbed the Lolita Express. What she's said: \"I began my massage, trying not to let him smell my fear and obvious discomfort, but before I knew what was happening, he grabbed onto my wrist and tugged me towards the bed. \"I tried to pull away, but he was unbuttoning my shorts and pulling my body onto his already naked body faster than I could think. \"I was searching for words but all I could say was, 'No, please stop,' but that just seemed to excite him more.\" Michelle Licata Michelle Licata was among Epstein's accusers in the previous criminal case in Florida in 2008. She claims she was lured to Epstein's Palm Beach resort aged 16 and told \"you're just so beautiful and sexy\". What she's said: \"What happened to me occurred many years ago when I was in high school, but it still affects my life. \"I was told then that Jeffrey Epstein was going to be held accountable, but he was not. \"In fact, the government worked out a secret deal and didn't tell me about it. \"The fact that I mattered this time and the other victims mattered is what counts.\" Maria and Annie Farmer, sisters Annie Farmer (pictured second from right) was 16 when she was introduced to Epstein by her then-25-year-old sister Maria. Both sisters claim that they were assaulted by Epstein and alleged \"madam\" Ghislaine Maxwell that year. Annie has said on behalf of her sister Maria: \"Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell not only assaulted her, but as we're hearing from so many of these brave women here today, they stole her dreams and her livelihood. \"She risked her safety in 1996, so many years ago, to report them \u2014 to no avail \u2014 and it is heartbreaking to her and to me that all this destruction has been wrought since that time.\" Marijke Chartouni What she's said: \u201c[I came forward] to be a voice to the victims who may not be able to tell their story, or at least not yet.\u201d Theresa J.
