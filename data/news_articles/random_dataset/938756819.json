Da Nang\u2019s beaches, which host some 50,000 tourists daily during the high season, were emptied when the city was locked down Tuesday.\n\nQueensland state, which is believed to be free of community transmission of the virus, has been allowing in all interstate travelers except those from coronavirus hot spot Victoria state.\n\nWhile businesses lost visitors from Melbourne, Australia\u2019s second-largest city, at least they could look forward to Sydney residents escaping the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s winter for a tropical Great Barrier Reef vacation.\n\nBut a growing Sydney outbreak led the Queensland government to reconsider and Sydney visitors will now be banned from Saturday.\n\nQueensland Tourism Industry Council deputy chief executive Brett Kapernick said the loss of Sydney visitors would cost some tourism operators 40% of their revenue.\n\n\u201cWith this pandemic, the situation becomes fluid and therefore evolves weekly,\u201d Kapernick said. \u201cA week ago, we didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be facing a border closed to Sydney.\u201d\n\nLike Australia, Hong Kong effectively closed its borders in March, driving down tourist numbers by 90%. At first, Hong Kong seemed successful in dealing with the pandemic, helped by residents\u2019 fastidious mask-wearing and restrictions on public gatherings and restaurants.\n\nThe city had weeks with zero local transmissions in May and June, and the government relaxed the rules. Hotels offered \u201cstaycation\u201d packages and theme parks reopened.\n\nThe tourism industry was again plunged into crisis, though, by Hong Kong\u2019s worst outbreak in July, with hundreds of new, locally transmitted cases.\n\nJapan\u2019s outbreaks have spread across the country with increasing travel during summer holidays. In recent days, the numbers of newly confirmed infections nationwide has topped 1,000 and the number of deaths recently also surpassed 1,000, with more than 31,000 confirmed cases so far.\n\nCritics have faulted Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s administration for its \u201cGoTo\u201d campaign, offering discounts and other incentives for domestic tourism, even though the campaign excluded Tokyo, a hot spot with surging infections.\n\nThailand, like Vietnam, has been among the success stories of the pandemic. It has counted around 3,300 cases, with all of them in recent weeks among Thai soldiers, workers and students returning from abroad. But the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development recently cited the Southeast Asian travel hub as one of the countries expected to lose the greatest percentage of its GDP due to the pandemic and tourism restrictions.\n\nThailand\u2019s Cabinet this week approved three projects together worth more than $700 million to help the tourism industry, which normally account for more than 10% of GPD.\n\nBali\u2019s reopening to domestic tourism after an almost four-month lockdown is step toward overseas arrivals resuming in September.\n\nNormally bustling beaches and streets on the idyllic island were emptied in late March. Authorities restricted public activities, closed the airport and shuttered all shops, bars, restaurants and tourist attractions. Limits were eased beginning three weeks ago, and visitors will face stringent rules in hotels, restaurants and on beaches.\n\nThe island that\u2019s home to more than 4 million people, attracted more than 6 million tourists from abroad and 10 million from Indonesia last year, according to government data.\n\nAccording to Indonesia\u2019s Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister, Luhut Pandjaitan, the tourism sector has lost an estimated $500 million due to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe government will waive taxes for hoteliers and restaurants in 10 promoted destinations for the next six months. Local governments will be compensated by the central government for the loss of taxes, which is estimated to total $230 million.\n\nIn Australia, Kapernick said keeping Queensland COVID-19-free was more important to the struggling tourism industry than letting in more holidaymakers.\n\n\u201cWhat will send businesses to the wall quicker is if we don\u2019t control these outbreaks that are happening now and we find ourselves in a situation like (hot spot state) Victoria,\u201d Kapernick said."}}
