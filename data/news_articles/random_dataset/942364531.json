I thought I was stressed and just hadn\u2019t been eating well, but when it didn\u2019t I thought, \u2018Okay, I have to see a doctor\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe 28-year-old underwent a series of blood tests to rule out Crohn\u2019s disease and Celiac disease, but was called into her doctor\u2019s office a few days later.\n\nShe was then directed to take a CT scan at the local hospital emergency room.\n\nMs Battersby, who had just completed her journalism degree months earlier, said it was after doctors asked for a second CT scan that she really began to worry.\n\nMinutes later, a physician told a shocked Ms Battersby she had a large tumour \u2013 seven by five centimetres \u2013 almost entirely blocking the middle section of her bowel.\n\n\u201cHe walked in and said, \u2018We don\u2019t normally tell people this straight away because we need further tests, but it\u2019s pretty undeniable from the size of your tumour that you have cancer\u2019,\u201d she told Yahoo News Australia.\n\nView photos The young woman had the tumour removed from her bowel just four days after her diagnosis.
