Earth launched on the web with the Chrome-only Native Client, or NaCl, as there wasn\u2019t a standard that supported what it wanted to do becoming of the many Chrome-only websites from Google. Despite this Google says \u201c\u2026we are big supporters of open web standards.\u201d\n\nNaCl, perhaps a pun on salt, allows Google to bring native C++ app code and run it directly on Chrome browsers \u2013 giving users all the performance capabilities they\u2019ll need to zoom in and out of locations on a virtual globe. Google has spent the last three years on emerging web standards like WebAssembly, which allows other developers to bring native code to the web.\n\nOver the past 6 months, Google has been beta testing a switch from its NaCl implementation to WebAssembly \u2013 this testing has been successful, leading to today\u2019s launch of Google Earth on Edge, Firefox and Opera.\n\n\n\n\n\nConspicuous by its absence is Safari, but the Google Earth team notes in a blog post that they still \u201chave some work to do,\u201d and they would be \u201cpolishing our experience across all these browsers and adding support for Safari.\u201d\n\nGoogle has stated that they would add Earth support for Safari once Apple adds \u201cbetter support for WebGL2\u201d in the browser.\n\nCheck out Google Earth on Edge, Firefox and Opera here.\n\nEdited by Luis Monzon\n\nFollow Luis Monzon on Twitter\n\nFollow IT News Africa on Twitter"}}
