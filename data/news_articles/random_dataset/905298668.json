Another worker has been injured. The MLA escaped unhurt.\n\nThree people who allegedly opened the fire have been arrested.

He was standing in an open car with his supporters as he left the temple when unknown persons opened fire at the car. Mr Yadav said there were celebratory fireworks in the area when his car was passing and initially thought the sound was that of the fireworks. When he realised that his car was shot at, the MLA was moved to another car.\n\nSpeaking to news agency ANI, Mr Yadav demanded that police should thoroughly check the CCTV footage to identify the assailants who shot at his convoy.\n\n\"The incident is really unfortunate. I do not know the reason behind the attack but it happened all of a sudden. Around 4 rounds were fired. The vehicle I was in was attacked. I am sure if the police probes properly, they will be able to identify the assailant,\" Naresh Yadav was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.\n\nMr Yadav added that he could have been killed.\n\n\"Two people were shot, in which Ashok Mann-ji has died and Harender-ji was injured. I do not know whether they attacked me in particular but they certainly targeted our convoy. Anybody could have been shot in this attack including me,\" he said.\n\nAAP MP Sanjay Singh has raised questions on law and order of the national capital.\n\n\"The brazen murder of Ashok Mann after an attack on Mehrauli MLA Naresh Yadav- this is the rule of law in Delhi, Naresh Yadav was returning from a temple,\" AAP leader Sanjay Singh tweeted in Hindi.\n\nArvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party surged to power in Delhi for a third term, boosted by a massive mandate of 62 seats - just a shade lower than its record 67 seats of 2015. The BJP won 8 seats.The Congress failed to open its account, second time in a row.\n\nNaresh Yadav, the Mehrauli MLA, defeated BJP's Kusum Khatri with a margin of 18,161 votes.\n\nThe law and order in the national capital, which is overseen by the centre, has been a hot topic ever since two shootings took place at the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protest sites last month. The AAP had attacked Home Minister Amit Shah over the incidents.\n\nLast week, after a mob barged into the campus of Delhi's Gargi college and sexually assaulted students, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said such behaviour will not be \"tolerated\".\n\n\"Misbehaviour with our daughters in Gargi College is very sad and disappointing. This sort of behaviour will not be tolerated. Culprits should be given the harshest possible punishment and we must ensure that children studying in our colleges feel safe,\" Mr Kejriwal had tweeted."}}
