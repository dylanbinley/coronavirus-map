Israel currently gives out 5,500 permits.\n\nIsrael has allowed cement imports into the Strip since 2014 under a mechanism overseen by the UN designed to ensure building materials are used for civilian purposes and not constructing tunnels or other military infrastructure.\n\nIn 2016, Israel froze cement imports for 45 days after a cross-border tunnel was discovered.\n\n\u201cThe decision was made following security consultations and in light of repeated terror activity from the Gaza Strip against Israeli citizens over the past weeks, which have represented a violation of Israeli sovereignty,\u201d the Defense Ministry unity charged with liaising with Palestinian civil authorities said in a statement.\n\nSaturday was the fourth day in a row in which terrorists in the Strip fired rockets or mortar shells at southern Israel.\n\nThroughout the day on Saturday, a number of balloons suspected of carrying explosive devices were launched from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel.\n\nBalloon clusters were found in the Lachish and Merhavim regional councils to the east of Gaza. Police sappers were called to handle the potential bombs.\n\nExplosive devices and incendiary devices tied to balloons have increasingly been floating over the border from Gaza in recent weeks.\n\nLate last month a senior Hamas official said the recent string of balloons was a signal to Israel to accelerate unofficial \u201cunderstandings\u201d meant to ease the blockade on the territory ruled by the terror group.\n\nDefense Minister Naftali Bennett has not commented on the recent round of violence. The Blue and White party on Friday called for a Knesset debate on Sunday to address the situation.\n\nTensions between Israel and Gaza have been steadily rising over the past two weeks after several months of relative calm. Fears have mounted in recent days of an escalation of violence in Gaza and the West Bank following the release of the US peace plan that is seen as heavily favoring Israel.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, the military announced it was deploying additional troops to the Gaza border and West Bank amid concerns that Palestinians may respond violently to the peace plan, which was released on Tuesday."}}
