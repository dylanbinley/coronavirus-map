The payments were reportedly made in cash, as well as by wire transfers.\n\nDuring the probe, authorities questioned monks in two monasteries in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh States about the funds they received.\n\nAccording to local media, earlier this month Indian tax authorities accused Peng of money laundering and of paying monks between $2,700 and $4,000 to spy on the Dalai Lama and \u201cinfiltrate\u201d his inner circle.\n\nPeng was described as a businessman with interests in Bengaluru. He was previously detained in 2018 for holding a fake Indian passport. Authorities have also identified a Delhi-based accountant who is believed to be Peng\u2019s accomplice.\n\nA new Dalai Lama is considered to be the reincarnation of a previous one. The search for a young boy who is declared the successor is done by lamas, high-ranking Tibetan priests. The selection process can take several years.\n\nThe current Dalai Lama, 85, has been living in India since 1959 after fleeing Tibet during a conflict with the Chinese authorities.__RT.Com"}}
