Kazuhiro Nogi / AFP - Getty Images file\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s trade war has done significant damage to the U.S. and global economies,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. Zandi said the trade war has shaved half a percentage point off global GDP growth and cost the U.S. 375,000 jobs.\n\nLet our news meet your inbox.

In the report, IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath listed an increase in trade protectionism and \u201celevated uncertainty\u201d pertaining to trade and other geopolitical issues as the first two impediments to more robust economic expansion.\n\nGopinath said the global economy is undergoing a \u201csynchronized slowdown,\u201d despite an environment of accommodative monetary policy.\n\nFormer Bank of England governor Mervyn King, who presided over the central bank during and after the financial crisis and recession of 2008 and 2009, said at the IMF meeting that the United States\u2019 trade war with China and its increasing disengagement on the world stage are two primary risks that threaten to undermine global economic growth. The world is in a \u201cgreat stagnation,\u201d he said. He warned that, absent changes to the current trajectories set by monetary and fiscal policymakers around the world, another instance of destabilization would leave central banks around the world with few tools to fight back.\n\nIn an interview on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" that aired on Sunday, former IMF director and incoming European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde also elaborated on how the White House\u2019s trade protectionism is holding back spending and investment.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest key that President Trump has is in relation to predictability and certainty of the terms of trade. It's the unknown which is hurting, because you can't adjust to the unknown,\u201d she said, adding that a lack of predictability deters companies from spending and contributing to economic expansion. \u201cThey sit on their cash,\u201d she said.\n\nZandi concurred with Lagarde\u2019s assessment. \u201cThe higher tariffs have brought global trade to a standstill and the uncertainty has undermined business confidence and investment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf President Trump follows through on his threats to raise tariffs on vehicle imports into the U.S. in November or on Chinese imports in December, then the U.S. and global economies are likely to suffer downturns next year.\u201d\n\nWith so much uncertainty swirling around Trump, trade experts said next year\u2019s election could be pivotal in the business community\u2019s willingness to invest. \u201cThe 2020 election, of course, is the big issue in all these discussions at this point,\u201d V\u00e9ron said. \u201cIf Trump wins, that will probably mean no end to the trade war.\u201d\n\nGoods-producing industries both in the U.S. and abroad are already suffering, Zandi said. \u201cThe U.S. manufacturing, agriculture and transportation industries, accounting for approximately one-fifth of output, are in recession,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe IMF also noted the wide-ranging nature of the trade war\u2019s impact in manufacturing and production output. \u201cA notable feature of the sluggish growth in 2019 is the sharp and geographically broad-based slowdown in manufacturing and global trade,\u201d Gopinath said. \u201cHigher tariffs and prolonged uncertainty surrounding trade policy have dented investment and demand for capital goods.\u201d\n\nLagarde said that if the U.S. and China fail to reach a resolution and the trade war escalates, the ripple effects could be felt worldwide to an even greater extent. \u201cIt's certainly going to give a big haircut to the global economy,\u201d she predicted."}}
