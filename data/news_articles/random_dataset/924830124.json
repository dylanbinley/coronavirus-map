Yesterday, the motion was provisionally blocked by the justices. \u201cWednesday\u2019s order, called a stay, will remain in place until the Trump administration files its formal appeal of a lower court ruling directing the Justice Department to share the grand jury files with the House Judiciary Committee,\u201d The Washington Free Beacon reports . The Beacon adds, \u201cIf the Court decides to hear the Trump administration\u2019s appeal, the stay will remain in place well past the November election, depriving Democrats of still another campaign cudgel against the president.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Joe Biden, who Tara Reade alleges sexually assaulted her in 1993, gave the virtual commencement address to graduates of Columbia Law School. The school\u2019s dean, Gillian Lester, declared in a pre-ceremony announcement letter that Biden\u2019s \u201cenduring and exemplary career as a leader, lawyer and public servant sets an example for our students as they prepare to begin their own course as legal professionals.\u201d But as The Daily Wire reminds us, \u201cColumbia law faculty and administration were among the most vocal opponents of [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, leading both in-person protests, and organizing 2,400 other law professors to sign a letter calling Kavanaugh unfit to serve on the nation\u2019s highest court.\u201d The hypocrisy is bad enough. Even worse is the fact that the allegations against Biden are far more credible than anything leveled at Kavanaugh."}}
