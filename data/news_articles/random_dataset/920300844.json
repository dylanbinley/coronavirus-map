Any delay could cost lives.\u201d\n\nLabor MK Itzik Shmuli, slated to become welfare minister in the new government, called the news an \u201cemergency wake-up call\u201d and urged the leadership to \u201cchange course and significantly broaden the financial safety net for the self-employed and the unemployed.\u201d\n\nEarlier Sunday, Mahane Yehuda merchants clashed with police during a demonstration protesting the continued closure of the landmark market even as most stores nationwide have been allowed to reopen on Sunday.\n\nVideos posted online showed a scrum of small businessmen scuffling with uniformed officers at the market\u2019s Agrippas Street entrance. One of the protesters was arrested and later released and Tali Friedman, who represents Mahane Yehuda\u2019s shop owners, was summoned for questioning by the police.\n\nIn an interview with Army Radio, Friedman said it was illogical for Mahane Yehuda and Israel\u2019s other outdoor markets to be kept closed while all other stores outside of shopping malls were now permitted to open, declaring that \u201cthis cannot go on.\u201d She said that the shop owners had tried to maintain social distancing during their protest, but that it had not always been possible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been kept closed for a month,\u201d she said, warning that the small businesses were dying and calling the situation unfair.\n\n\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05de\u05e2\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d4\u05e4\u05d2\u05e0\u05ea \u05e1\u05d5\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9 \u05e9\u05d5\u05e7 \u05de\u05d7\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd@GLZRadio pic.twitter.com/wBdzZ9JJZx \u2014 \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05e9\u05d2\u05d1 | Yuval Segev (@Segev_Yuval) April 26, 2020\n\nMayor Lion declared his support for the shop owners, tweeting that he hoped the government would \u201csoon approve the opening of the market, which is a source of income for hundreds of Jerusalemite families.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise you, market vendors and Jerusalem residents, that I won\u2019t let up until the market is reopened,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDespite the prohibition on the opening of markets, numerous shops in Mahane Yehuda have been open in recent weeks.\n\nThe problems faced by small eateries were recently given a face by falafel store owner Yuval Carmi of Ashdod, whose tearful account of being unable to provide for his family, as he couldn\u2019t sell food for takeaway, moved the nation last week.\n\nDespite the new, more relaxed rules, small businesspeople expressed concerns about their future economic viability, claiming that they were being allowed to resume operations only under onerously restrictive conditions that will deter most customers, solely so that the state can justify denying them compensation for their losses.\n\nMany people are still nervous about going out, and the restriction barring the general public from traveling more than 100 meters from their homes (except for work, shopping or other essential purposes) will remain in effect until after Independence Day, which ends Wednesday evening.\n\nOn Friday, the government approved a NIS 8 billion ($2.27 billion) plan to increase support for self-employed Israelis and small business owners who have been hit hard by the coronavirus, following accusations that Israel was not helping businesses that were forced to shut down.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of Israel\u2019s largest chains remain closed on Sunday, despite approval to reopen, in protest against the government and as they demand compensation for the recent closures and ongoing restrictions.\n\nLarge business owners are demanding government compensation for operation losses, in line with those announced for small businesses.\n\nAnger rose particularly on Wednesday as IKEA reopened its furniture stores in accordance with government rules, drawing in large crowds, while many other shops remained shuttered. Outgoing Health Minister Yaakov Litzman has strenuously denied allegations that this decision was linked to millions of shekels in donations to the minister\u2019s Gur Hasidic sect.\n\nUnemployment in Israel was at 27.05 percent, or 1,125,814 people, as of Thursday.\n\nIsraeli organization Eran operates a 1201 mental health crisis hotline that receives support from the Health Ministry to help individuals in crisis."}}
