Instead of hype about Russia, perhaps the alliance should address the actual danger to Europe, analysts tell RT.\n\nThe Pentagon had already deployed some 6,000 troops and 3,000 pieces of equipment to Europe by March 13, when the transfers were halted amid the rapid spread of the coronavirus. The decision to cancel the drills actually improved European security, since the risk of covid-19 transmission among the troops \u2013 and from them to civilians \u2013 was unacceptably high, former US Marine Corps intelligence officer and international security commentator Scott Ritter told RT.\n\nCanceling the exercise was \u201cthe most prudent action possible\u201d from the political standpoint, said Ritter, as the fallout from US troops infecting civilians with the coronavirus would have made future such exercises \u201cproblematic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe exercise was more political than practical, a show of force designed to deter Russian \u2018aggression\u2019 in the Baltics,\u201d Ritter added. Poland and the Baltic states have clamored for a bigger NATO \u2013 mainly US \u2013 presence in their territory since 2014, hyping the threat of \u201cRussian aggression\u201d by pointing to the conflict in Ukraine. The US has happily obliged, even under the Trump administration, while NATO maintained its increased deployments on the Russian border were entirely defensive in nature. Needless to say, Moscow is not buying it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no actual military threat to Europe. Nobody is going to attack it,\u201d Konstantin Sokolov, geopolitics expert and research fellow with Russia\u2019s Academy of Natural Sciences, told RT.\n\nPolitical relations within NATO have been fraying for months, with unilateral actions in Syria by the US and Turkey prompting French President Emmanuel Macron to describe the alliance as \u201cbrain dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe crisis of political relations between the US and its allies is getting worse in the current situation, which is aggravated by selfishness of all sides,\u201d Sokolov told RT. The US and its European allies have been acting on their own to cope with the virus, shutting down borders and implementing strictly national policies. The main threat to Europe is the coronavirus, not Russia, says Vladimir Batyuk, a senior fellow at the Russian Institute for US and Canadian Studies.\n\n\u201cIn Italy alone, the virus has killed several hundred people. Russian military action didn\u2019t hurt a single person from European NATO member states in the last three decades,\u201d Batyuk told RT. There were 2,500 recorded deaths from the coronavirus in Italy as of Tuesday.\n\nRick Rozoff, peace activist at StopNato International, thinks it\u2019s incredibly ironic that a virus seems to have derailed, however temporarily, NATO\u2019s strategic priority to expand to the Russian border.\n\n\u201cThis is a tactical retreat, in the face of nature,\u201d he told RT. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to assume that, if and when the coronavirus is brought under control, that we\u2019ll see the resumption of such military provocations, large-scale military exercises on Russia\u2019s western border.\u201d\n\nRozoff pointed out that the Atlantic Council \u2013 the alliance\u2019s massive think-tank and lobbying arm \u2013 had just called for an increased US troop presence in Europe under the pretext of fighting the coronavirus, same as they\u2019ve done with anything from terrorism to climate change and women\u2019s rights over the years. Some of those US troops may be more urgently needed at home, he added, as over 1,000 National Guard personnel have already been called up to help with the pandemic.\n\n\u2018Defender Europe 2020\u2019 was supposed to be the largest NATO exercise in 25 years, encompassing smaller exercises that were scheduled to take place in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia starting in April and continuing into May."}}
