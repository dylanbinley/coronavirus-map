Court prosecutor Insp Winston Dillon said the police file was being compiled and would be expedited so the evidence can be disclosed.

He also disagreed with a claim that his client refused to give his fingerprint or sign a document relating to the tracing of his criminal record.\n\nThe case was adjourned to June 14. Matas was charged by PC Danny Moonsammy, also of Homicide Bureau of Investigations Region 2.\n\nInvestigations were supervised by Insp Shaun Craig, acting Insp Christopher Fuentes and Sgt Belinda Sylvester of the Homicide Bureau.\n\nORIGINAL STORY:\n\nA 22-year-old man from Malick has appeared before Chief Magistrate Maria Busby Earle-Caddle for the murder of 19-year-old Tabaquite lettuce farmer Leon Bebe.\n\nShaquille Mattas appeared in the Port of Spain Eight Magistrates Court charged with Bebe\u2019s murder on April 10; robbing him of a gold chain and possession of a firearm and ammunition.\n\nHe was also charged with kidnapping a friend of Bebe\u2019s and robbing him of a Samsung S7 cellphone.\n\nAll the charges were laid indictably so Mattas was not called on the enter a plea.\n\nThe 19-year-old lettuce farmer and a friend went to pay for an exotic bird.\n\nThey were confronted by their assailants and Bebe, of Poonah Road in Whiteland, was shot multiple times at Seventh Avenue, Malick.\n\nHe died at hospital.\n\nBebe was for his entrepreneurship in the field of hydroponics farming.\n\nMattas was represented by attorney Richard Clarke-Wills."}}
