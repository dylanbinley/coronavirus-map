Hunter D\u2019Antuono | Flathead Beacon\n\nPart of the Flathead National Forest is now home to Montana\u2019s third Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) timber sale after St. Onge Logging of Kalispell submitted the winning bid this summer.\n\nThrough the GNA, the U.S. Forest Service and the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) are able to collaborate on managing the 386-acre Liger Timber Sale located southeast of Hungry Horse.\n\nThe GNA initiative, which is part of the 2018 Farm Bill, allows the state to manage timber harvests on federal lands and reinvest the generated funds back into the forest for future projects.\n\nThe Kalispell Chamber of Commerce hosted an on-site timber tour on Oct. 17 with officials from the Forest Service, the DNRC, St. Onge Logging, F.H Stoltze Land & Lumber Co. and Weyerhaeuser.\n\n\u201cThe timber revenue from a GNA sale is held by the state, and the state and the forest work together to decide where to reinvest,\u201d Good Neighbor Authority Program Authority Manager Neil Simpson said.\n\nSimpson says on a regular timber sale, those funds would go to the U.S. Treasury where the revenue may not return to the forest.\n\n\u201cGNA allows more funds to be kept on the ground, performing forest management instead of going to the U.S. treasury where a lot of the sum of dollars from a sale leave the forest entirely,\u201d he said. \u201cGNA allows more funds to be retained.\u201d\n\nThe DNRC says the Liger project will produce roughly 1.6 million board-feet of timber and generate $376,798, which the DNRC and the Forest Service will use for future non-commercial projects such as hazardous fuels reduction, forest restoration, weed spraying and stream-improvement activities.\n\nHungry Horse Ranger District Forester Paul Donnellon says funds will likely go toward the 377,090-acre Hungry Lion Resource Management Project. In addition to timber harvests, the site will also undergo vegetation management, culvert replacements, prescribed burns, watershed restorations and road relocations near Emery Creek.\n\nLiger is one of three Montana GNA timber sales that have been sold, in addition to the Boulder Lowlands on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest and Elk Gem in the Kootenai National Forest.\n\nDNRC Federal Engagement Forester Ben Garrett says future GNA projects are in progress in multiple ranger districts in northwestern Montana, including one in the Tally Lake Ranger District and another in the Swan Lake Ranger District. He said projects in Idaho have proven to be successful.\n\nGarrett says multi-agency collaboration is the main difference between GNA timber sales and regular timber sales.\n\n\u201cIt can be done by both Forest Service and state personnel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt allows states to be utilized by its efficiencies, and the Forest Service and gets the project done quicker.\u201d\n\nSt. Onge Logging\u2019s location in Kalispell gives the family-owned company close access to the timber harvest site.\n\nOwner Kevin St. Onge bought the company from his father in 1994, who started St. Onge Logging in the early 1970s. After nearly 50 years in the timber industry, this is the first time the company has participated in a project like this.\n\n\u201cThe benefit is the manageable timber,\u201d St. Onge said. \u201cIt\u2019s more tools in the tool basket for management. Available timber is good; it\u2019s real competitive in the Flathead.\u201d\n\nTo initiate the GNA process, officials must complete environmental assessments through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in the proposed area to analyze the potential effects of a timber sale. Once it\u2019s gone through the environmental assessment, the state creates a contract and local contractors bid on the sale.\n\nPrior to logging, silviculturists identify which trees can be harvested in order to retain a healthy forest.\n\n\u201cThe goal was to remove weaker, less resilient trees,\u201d Garrett said.\n\nOnce the trees are harvested, they\u2019re sent to local mills like F.H. Stoltze and Weyerhaeuser. Finally, the GNA Timber Sale revenue is reinvested back into the forest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thankful the states are willing to work with us and we hope we\u2019re setting the course for more projects like this in the future so we have funding that stays right here on the Flathead,\u201d Hungry Horse District Ranger Rob Davies said."}}
