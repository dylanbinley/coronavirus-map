Those connections have become increasingly important as communication and travel have become cheaper and easier. But in some countries\u2014especially the US\u2014 political tensions over immigration and economic security are starting to make some scientists uneasy about how to continue their collaborations). This isn\u2019t the first era when politics has interfered with collaborations that researchers find immensely valuable. Scientists fought to keep relationships with the former Soviet Union during the Cold War, for example, and the Malta Conference s have worked to preserve scientific ties in the midst of Middle East conflicts.\n\nChuan He grew up in China and moved to the US for graduate school. He is now a chemistry professor at the University of Chicago. Since 2009, he has also run a lab at Peking University, where he was invited to develop a chemical biology center. \u201cIt\u2019s a different intellectual environment,\u201d he says of his multiple international collaborations. \u201cPeople think about things differently in ways that inspire you.\u201d\n\nInternational collaborations don\u2019t usually make research easier, says Peter Stang, a University of Utah chemistry professor who has long-term collaborations in many countries. In fact, communication and coordination needs mean that both sides have to work harder than if they set off as solitary scientists in a lab. But working together is the only way to tackle the big problems in science, Stang believes.\n\n\u201cThe simple problems in science have mostly been solved,\u201d he says. \u201cThe remaining problems are more and more complex, and very few if any single individual has all the expertise. I collaborate because you value knowledge and expertise that your collaborator has that you don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nC&EN talked with researchers about how they started their international research collaborations, why international research is important to them, and how they try to navigate rocky waters while continuing to work with the best partners they can find, no matter where they are.\n\nNigist Asfaw\n\nEthiopia\n\nSometimes collaborations start by accident, says Addis Ababa University chemistry professor Nigist Asfaw.\n\nAround 15 years ago, Martyn Poliakoff from the University of Nottingham wandered into the Chemistry Department at Addis Ababa. Poliakoff\u2019s son was in the country teaching, and they decided to visit the university just to see what it was like.\n\n\u201cWe met by chance on the staircase,\u201d recalls Asfaw, who studies natural product chemistry. She went to Nottingham to give a lecture the following summer, and she has been collaborating with Poliakoff ever since.\n\nIt\u2019s often hard for African scientists to find collaborators, but it\u2019s not because they are not great scientists. Rather, \u201cpeople in Ethiopia don\u2019t talk about themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the culture.\u201d While doing her PhD in Norway, she found it odd that people talked about themselves \u201cso much,\u201d she says. Her collaboration with Poliakoff has helped her better promote her own work. \u201cHe always encourages me, and I actually have changed a bit,\u201d she says.\n\nCommunicating with colleagues abroad isn\u2019t always easy from Ethiopia, where the internet and other utilities aren\u2019t reliable\u2014sometimes the internet will go down for several hours without warning. \u201cIt takes time and patience, but it can be done,\u201d Asfaw says.\n\nA bigger frustration is the long visa process to apply to visit colleagues in Europe or the US. The application can include dozens of questions about prior travel and whether people have the money to get home and the ties to want to do so. \u201cSometimes, even after all of that, students or even some of my colleagues were denied,\u201d she says. Sometimes they are denied for no reason\u2014or no reason they can change, like a salary deemed to be too low.\n\nDespite the trouble, Asfaw finds it vital to work internationally. Collaborations can help mitigate some of the problems with moving equipment and chemicals in and out of Ethiopia, she says, by giving her easier access to them. She also gets many new ideas from her collaborators, and they have helped her value her own science. \u201cMany scientists are doing the same things as me\u2014it boosts my confidence,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is so important for us.\u201d\n\nCarlos J. Bustamante\n\nUS\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Carlos J. Bustamante left Peru to go to graduate school in the US. He intended to return, but political and economic turmoil prevented that. He wound up staying for a postdoc. He then joined the chemistry faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, where he works on single-molecule manipulation and detection.\n\nOver time, however, Bustamante has been able to build scientific ties to his country of origin. He started by organizing chemistry courses in Peru. Then, in 2010, he established a lab at Cayetano Heredia University. \u201cWe always talk about brain drain\u201d from developing countries, he says, and he hoped that extending his research program there would help the situation.\n\nStarting a lab in Peru hasn\u2019t been easy, Bustamante says, between funding difficulties and a national focus on applied research. As the country\u2019s economy has stabilized, more funding is available, so more Peruvian scientists are returning. \u201cThings are improving greatly,\u201d he says. Having a lab in Peru has led Bustamante to collaborations throughout Latin America, with researchers in Chile, Argentina, and elsewhere.\n\nRecent tensions in the US around immigration and research security have hurt his efforts, Bustamante says. Students have to wait weeks or months to enter the US, and that is encouraging top students to choose Europe over the US. Policy makers \u201cdon\u2019t realize that the most important capital is human capital,\u201d he says. \u201cTalent is everywhere, in all of the countries. By making it harder and harder for students to go to the US, we are shooting ourselves in the foot.\u201d\n\nJaeheung Cho\n\nSouth Korea\n\nFrom the start of his research career, Jaeheung Cho was on an international track. After growing up in South Korea, he got his PhD in Japan and then did a postdoc in the US. So it was natural for him to continue far-flung collaborations when he returned to South Korea to become a chemistry professor at Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology, where his research focuses on biomimetic materials.\n\nThough he doesn\u2019t travel to the US or Europe very often, Cho sends samples for analysis on equipment unavailable in his country and corresponds regularly via email and Skype with collaborators in the US and Germany. He also sends students to work in Japan, often for months at a time. He values how scientists from different countries bring different perspectives to research. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of refreshing,\u201d he says.\n\nHis collaborations in the US haven\u2019t been disrupted by tensions there around immigration and research security. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of that type of bad luck, but for me I never think it goes too bad,\u201d he says. But a recent dispute between South Korea and Japan has caused him some concern, especially moves by Japan to try to protect its chemical industry. Cho visited Japan earlier this year and found collaborators he wanted to work with. They agreed to submit a joint proposal for international funding, but now he worries how it will be received. \u201cRight now the situation is really bad between South Korea and Japan, so I\u2019m hesitating to push the button,\u201d he says.\n\nCho hopes that the funders will be able to think about science separately from politics, but he knows that might not be possible. \u201cAs scientists, we cannot do anything about the politics.\u201d\n\nOdile Eisenstein\n\nFrance\n\nFor Odile Eisenstein, there was never any question that her research would be global. She did her PhD in a French lab that had an ongoing stream of visitors from all over the world, and her two postdocs in Switzerland and the US reinforced that decision. \u201cI realized science was an international business right away,\u201d Eisenstein says.\n\nAfter her postdoc years, Eisenstein worked at the University of Michigan\u2013Ann Arbor for 2 years. She then returned to France to become a research professor for the National Center for Scientific Research at Paris-Sud University in Orsay before founding a group that is now part of the Institut Charles Gerhardt Montpellier.\n\nAt the institute, she has cultivated scientific partnerships all over the world doing theoretical work on transition-metal complexes. She\u2019s found her most important collaborators have been with researchers with whom she formed strong personal connections. \u201cI could not collaborate with someone I would not go to dinner with,\u201d she says. While communication is easier because of the internet, collaboration needs a personal touch, she believes. \u201cYou have to be next to each other for hours and hours and hours discussing the issues, drinking tea or coffee together,\u201d she says.\n\nEisenstein hasn\u2019t heard of problems with scientists traveling to or from France, but she knows her collaborators in the US and UK are concerned about being cut off from the rest of the world. \u201cMany of us speak broken English, but we share the science in common. That is a language that is sufficiently clear.\u201d\n\nEusebio Juaristi\n\nMexico\n\nEusebio Juaristi has been collaborating with scientists in the US for decades, often driving from his lab in Mexico City to Arizona or North Carolina or wherever his colleagues might be. But now for the first time, Juaristi is worried about whether a Mexican license plate might make him a target if he drives to teach a course at Stanford University next year.\n\n\u201cIt is this kind of an uneasy feeling that you might be discriminated\u201d against, explains Juaristi, who is an emeritus professor at the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s funny that after 40 years this is the first time I feel a bit hesitant.\u201d\n\nAfter Juaristi got his undergraduate degree in Mexico, his first choice for graduate school was the US, which at the time scientists considered to be what Rome is to Catholics, he says. He was the only foreign graduate student in the Chemistry Department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill when he graduated in 1977.\n\nJuaristi stayed in the US for a postdoc, then returned to Mexico. He has been collaborating worldwide ever since. Initially he needed access to equipment that was unavailable nearby or research papers that his library lacked. But now his collaborations are focused more on finding the scientists who best complement his research interests in synthetic organic chemistry.\n\nUS universities are far more internationally diverse now, but top Mexican students are looking other places too. Juaristi hasn\u2019t personally had visa trouble, but he has heard of students and colleagues who have. \u201cI think many students now would consider, for example, Germany or France more attractive, especially from the point of view of being welcomed,\u201d Juaristi says.\n\nJean-Marie Lehn\n\nFrance\n\nNobel Prize winner and University of Strasbourg chemistry professor Jean-Marie Lehn says that when he talks to students, he emphasizes the international nature of science. \u201cDoing science is an activity where you have friends, colleagues all over the world. No border, no limits, no customs agents, nothing like that,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the early 1960s, when Lehn was getting his PhD at the University of Strasbourg, it was home to one of the most advanced nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers available at the time, so he would run samples for people from all over Europe. That early exposure cemented for him that science is an international endeavor, he says. He went on to do a postdoc in the US, in collaboration with a Swiss lab, before returning to the University of Strasbourg to rejoin the chemistry department as a faculty member.\n\nHe notes that some things about collaborating across oceans have gotten easier over time. \u201cWhen I started, when you had a paper with somebody\u2014let\u2019s say a postdoc who had left and gone back to his or her country\u2014you would have made Xerox copies, paper copies, sent it over, waited until it arrived there, and waited to get it back,\u201d he remembers.\n\nLehn has collaborated on his supramolecular work widely across the world and has run other labs concurrently with his one in Strasbourg\u2014one elsewhere in France and, more recently, a lab in China. He goes to China about once a year, and in between he works with professors there to keep his lab going. \u201cAs I work right now they are sleeping. When I sleep they will be waking up and looking at what I sent to them.\u201d\n\nPeople warn him that collaborating with China could endanger his intellectual property, but Lehn says he\u2019s not that kind of scientist. \u201cIf people are interested in what we are doing, that\u2019s rather good. Why should we keep it secret?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou always have things to fear,\u201d he adds, but notes that \u201cfear is not a good counselor.\u201d\n\nAs China\u2019s scientific community strengthens, Lehn hopes that scientists there keep their collaborative spirit. \u201cScience is international, and we all benefit from it,\u201d he says. A publication is \u201ca gift for the community of scientists, and the publications of all the others are a gift to you.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Naman\n\nChina\n\nGrowing up in the US, Benjamin Naman was interested in international travel, but he never thought he\u2019d end up working as a pharmaceutical chemistry professor in China. Then he found himself recruited into his first faculty position by Ningbo University after traveling there to visit collaborators. \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to take a job, but it turned into an opportunity that I couldn\u2019t imagine passing on,\u201d he says.\n\nNaman, who studies marine natural product chemistry, has been learning a lot about international research since he started at Ningbo University nearly 2 years ago. \u201cI expected a lot of cultural differences and language barriers and things like that,\u201d he says. But he also had to learn to write grant proposals for Chinese agencies, wait months for equipment to arrive, navigate a different academic calendar, and start an international company.\n\nNaman has kept a visiting scientist appointment at the University of California San Diego, where he did a postdoc. He travels back to the US a few times a year. If he can, Naman has students come along\u2014doing research in the US continues, at least for now, to provide a huge boost to a Chinese student\u2019s career\u2014but they are often reticent. One faced a months-long delay getting a visa, a story he has heard from other Ningbo colleagues. Besides visa issues, students worry about the proliferation of guns and general safety in the US, Naman says. \u201cI\u2019m dispelling a lot of myths that my Chinese students have,\u201d he says. \u201cAside from learning culture, I\u2019m also sharing culture. It\u2019s a kind of grassroots scientific diplomacy.\u201d\n\nThe economic tensions and the US trade war with China are also topics of discussion, Naman says. He hopes these issues get resolved soon. \u201cBy all accounts these economic tensions don\u2019t benefit the US. They don\u2019t benefit anybody.\u201d\n\nRobin Perutz\n\nUK\n\nRobin Perutz\u2019s research collaborations have come about in a variety of ways: a chance meeting through a colleague, a talk he heard at a conference, a connection with a sabbatical visitor that has stretched on for 20 years.\n\nBut what they have in common is that they have made his science better. \u201cMany of my most important, most useful results have come about through these collaborations,\u201d says Perutz, a chemist at the University of York.\n\nWith the UK\u2019s imminent departure\u2014or Brexit\u2014from the European Union, Perutz knows many scientists are worried about continuing work, especially with European colleagues. He is worried, too. Continuing large, European Union\u2013funded networks of collaborators \u201cis about to become much, much more difficult when Brexit happens,\u201d he says.\n\nBut money hasn\u2019t been the most important part of his collaborations, Perutz says. \u201cIf you let the changes in the funding schemes get in your way, then the research gets blocked,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes we\u2019ve had some funding, and sometimes we haven\u2019t. We just get on with it regardless of whether we have funding or not.\u201d\n\nOne of the most important lessons he\u2019s learned over the years is the international reach of science. \u201cWe see people from very many countries doing excellent work, and we get opportunities to collaborate with them,\u201d he says. \u201cThis gives us an international perspective that is often lacking in other professions.\u201d\n\nJoan Valentine\n\nUS\n\nWhen a former student first invited her to apply for a part-time appointment in South Korea, Joan Valentine never thought that her institution\u2014the University of California, Los Angeles\u2014would go for it. But the dean said yes, and Valentine spent the next decade traveling at least 4 months a year to Ewha Womans University, a research university for women.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing was sort of a unique opportunity,\u201d says Valentine, who studies the role of transition metals, metalloenzymes, and oxidative stress in health. \u201cI didn\u2019t seek it out, but I\u2019m really grateful that I was part of that.\u201d\n\nDuring the months she spent in South Korea, Valentine kept her UCLA lab running with the help of a lab manager, Skype lab meetings, and individual calls with lab members, all while she mentored students and worked with faculty in South Korea. One Korean researcher is still one of her closest collaborators, she says.\n\nLiving in South Korea gave Valentine important insight into the culture, which helped her collaborations, she says. For example, she learned that most Koreans won\u2019t say no to a request, because it isn\u2019t polite. Instead, they just put you off. \u201cI would never have learned that if I had not lived there,\u201d she says.\n\nWhile there haven\u2019t been particular political troubles between the US and South Korea, Valentine says she and her colleagues are concerned about the image that international scientists are getting of the US, given pervasive visa issues for scientists and the suspicions being cast on Chinese scientists. \u201cWe are projecting a national image that is so hostile,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd of course it\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nXiaoliang Sunney Xie\n\nChina\n\n\u201cI grew up at Peking University,\u201d Xiaoliang Sunney Xie says. His parents were professors there, and it\u2019s where he got his bachelor\u2019s degree in chemistry.\n\nHe then spent over 30 years living and working in the US, starting with graduate school and continuing through a 20-year career as a professor at Harvard University. But in 2018, he had the chance to return to his hometown, where he believes he has better research opportunities.\n\nXie works on single-cell genomics and, with colleagues in the US and China, developed a technology that allows for genetic testing of human embryos before they are implanted, including a new, noninvasive technique. He still has extensive collaborations in the US, and technologies he perfected in China are now being used in US clinics. \u201cIt is definitely a win-win situation for everybody,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is not the way American people are led to believe, that China is the only beneficiary.\u201d\n\nThe US initiated the ongoing trade war with China just months before Xie started his new job. It\u2019s left him disappointed in how economic issues have pushed their way into the research arena. \u201cWe are not doing any research related to national security, and the perception that any people who have labs in both countries are spies is just a total misjudgment,\u201d says Xie, who is a naturalized US citizen.\n\nCases of Chinese scientists being denied visas to attend meetings or stopped at US entry points without cause are alarming, he says. \u201cI am just a researcher doing research to help people in the world,\u201d Xie says. He worries that current US policy will \u201cprevent scientists from doing their normal work\u201d and discourage scientists from collaborating with colleagues in the US. \u201cWho wants to be distrusted and interrogated while doing their job?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cDisease has no borders. People of different ethnic groups all suffer from genetic disorders,\u201d Xie says. \u201cScience and medicine transcend politics.\u201d"}}
