Get rid of it,\u201d he told Postmedia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m no angel, but I didn\u2019t deserve that,\u201d he added. \u201cNobody deserves that. I don\u2019t care what you\u2019ve done. There\u2019s far better ways of handling people.\u201d\n\nPolice arrested Kaasa for causing a disturbance at the Wee Book Inn on 118 Avenue. Kaasa told Postmedia he was suffering from insomnia, anxiety and depression, and had been awake for two or three days. He drank heavily to self-medicate."}}
