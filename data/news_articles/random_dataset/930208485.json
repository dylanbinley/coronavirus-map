He sentenced him to 18 months on all other counts and ordered that each sentence run concurrently.\n\nJudge Nolan said that the appropriate headline sentence in the absence of mitigation was one of seven years, describing the offending as a \u201cserious pattern of misbehaviour\u201d.\n\nHe said that the mitigating factors included his age and that there was a possibility of him dying while imprisoned.\n\nHowever, he noted that it had been well decided by precedent that age was no barrier to prison sentences.\n\nThe retired doctor appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeal today.\n\nHis barrister, Hugh Hartnett SC, submitted several grounds of appeal, including that the trial judge had erred in law in refusing to discharge the jury on a number of occasions.\n\nThese included occasions when complainants gave evidence that the accused had been struck off the medical registrar, that a civil action had been settled and that there had been an earlier criminal trial.\n\n\u201cWhatever about on their own, the cumulative effect was to create a very real risk of prejudice in the case,\u201d he said.\n\nAny effect is magnified when there are multiple complainants, he added.\n\nCounsel further argued that the trial judge had erred in telling the jury that evidence of multiple complainants in the absence of collusion was \"compelling\" evidence.\n\n\u201cThe judge is saying that if you have multiple complainants, that\u2019s compelling evidence. That\u2019s not the way a jury should be charged,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe use of the word compelling was unfortunate and hugely prejudicial,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was made more so afterwards when the trial judge disclosed to the jury that was his view of the evidence.\u201d\n\nHe said this was \"fatal in a case like this\".\n\nMr Hartnett further submitted that the trial had been unfair in the circumstances of the accused man\u2019s age, health and medical condition.\n\n\u201cThere were indications that he had cognitive damage and various other health conditions,\u201d he noted.\n\nCathleen Noctor SC responded on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions.\n\nShe said that the defence had repeatedly asked the complainant, who referenced the doctor being struck off, about why he had come forward. This was despite it being clear from the case that he had come forward after seeing the story about the striking off on the news.\n\nIn relation to the complainant, who referenced the civil proceedings, she said that it had been put to that witness a number of times that he had brought such proceedings.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t have come as any surprise that this witness ended up making it clear that the proceedings were over,\u201d she said.\n\nJustice John Edwards, presiding with Justice Isobel Kennedy and Justice \u00dana Ni Raifeartaigh, reserved judgment."}}
