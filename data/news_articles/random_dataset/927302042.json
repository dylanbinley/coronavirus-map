So that persons are not exposed to Covid-19 while in there. There should be no risk for the staff attending to the people at the centres.\n\nCircumstances in general need to be conducive for people wanting to honour and respect quarantine recommendations,\u201d she said.\n\nDr Dlodlo said while quarantine facilities do not need to be luxurious, they should be habitable to curb incidences of returnees escaping from facilities.\n\nPolice have said as of Tuesday 158 people had escaped from quarantine centres countrywide.\n\nDr Dlodlo said special attention should be given to staffers who attend to returnees as they are a part of the people who can spread Covid-19 when they return to their homes.\n\nShe said the country was still doing well in terms of flattening the Covid-19 curve as shown by few local transmissions.\n\nFormer Mpilo Central Hospital clinical director Dr Wedu Ndebele, said the public seems to have relaxed on adherence to level two lockdown regulations.\n\nHe said while most people have face masks, some wear them below their neck, defeating the purpose of the need to wear them, which could result in those with the virus spreading it.\n\nDr Ndebele said the virus survives longer on surfaces in winter and the risk of contracting Covid-19 increases.\n\n\u201cWe need to enforce the measures more than we are doing because I think people have relaxed. When we started, I think we started fairly well but now people have completely relaxed. People think they are solving economic problems by going back to their normal ways. But in actual sense the situation may get worse if the virus spreads because those providing essentials will have to close if people are diagnosed within their premises,\u201d said Ndebele.\n\nHe said the country should guard against the outbreak of the virus which can collapse the already fragile health sector.\n\n\u201cOur capacity is very limited. People are busy trying to make as many (isolation medical) centres as possible that means that if there are more people that are sick especially the moderate to severe that need hospitalisation, we will definitely not have enough beds to admit all these sick people. So that\u2019s the impact on the health,\u201d he said.\n\nZimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association president Tawanda Zvakada hailed the increase in the number of people tested for Covid-19.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the country had conducted more than 48 000 tests.\n\nHe said the public should observe Covid-19 prevention measures as the virus will remain with us for a long time.\n\n\u201cIt means we need to practice more caution, more preventative measures and above all we need to learn to live with Covid-19 as it shows that it\u2019s within the country for a while. We need to co-exist with it. By that I mean come up with measures we can do to ensure that it doesn\u2019t spread more but we can allow for people to do other things that will allow them to survive because it\u2019s not always about Covid-19,\u201d said Dr Zvakada.\n\nDr Zvakada said with an increasing number of Covid-19 cases, Government must speed up the process of setting up medical isolation centres to cater for those critical.\n\n\u201cThe statistics show that the worst is yet to come, these isolation centres need to be equipped with ventilators and oxygen. In addition, Government should ensure that health workers are well motivated as opposed to working in environments as if it\u2019s under command. It has to ensure that the workers are well motivated like in other countries and have the desire to be on the frontline not as duty but as a way of serving fellow countrymen. This can be done through proper remuneration and ensuring that they have adequate Personal Protective Equipment,\u201d said Dr Zvakada. \u2014 @nqotshili"}}
