The sanctions impose a visa ban and asset freezes on the individuals.\n\nBrowder described the British sanctions as a \"huge milestone\u201d in his decade-long campaign.\n\nThe Russian Embassy in London called the British decision \u201chostile\u201d and said Moscow could take \u201cretaliatory measures\u201d without elaborating on what those steps could be.\n\n\"In Russia, investigators, prosecutors, and judges carry out their responsibilities independently of executive authorities and are guided by law alone,\" the embassy said.\n\nRussia has long rejected claims that Magnitsky was killed and has lobbied hard against the bills, accusing Browder and his lawyer of crimes, including fraud.\n\nThe British sanctions add tension to an already fraught relationship with Russia.\n\nLondon has accused Russia of \"destabilizing\" activities on its territory, including the 2018 chemical attack that almost killed former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Russia has denied the accusation.\n\nWith reporting by AFP, Reuters, and the Financial Times"}}
