Did He Violate His Probation?", "TEXT": "Randall Miller, the director who served a year in jail following a fatal accident on the set of \u201cMidnight Rider,\u201d shot a new film in London and Serbia last year.\n\nIn recent days, word of the project has spread in the Georgia film community, provoking outrage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extraordinarily pissed,\u201d said Jeff Harris, the attorney who represents the parents of Sarah Jones, the camera assistant who was killed on set. \u201cI believe this is a violation of his probation.\u201d\n\nJones was killed, and six others were injured, in a collision with a freight train while they were shooting a scene on a bridge near Jesup, Ga., in February 2014. In March 2015, Miller pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. Under the terms of his probation, he was not to serve as a \u201cdirector, first assistant director or supervisor with responsibility for safety in any film production\u201d for a period of 10 years.\n\nIn an interview on Wednesday, Miller said that he is allowed to direct, so long as someone else is responsible for safety.\n\n\u201cI was not the one in charge of safety at all,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt was a sedentary movie where everybody was talking in coffee shops. It\u2019s very hard to imagine that people could think this was somehow unsafe or wrong.\u201d\n\nEd Garland, Miller\u2019s Atlanta attorney, confirmed that his view is that Miller can direct.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve thought from the very beginning that the language was limited to him being in charge of safety,\u201d Garland said. \u201cHe\u2019s acting on the advice of counsel, and we\u2019re confident in our position.\u201d\n\nMiller was prosecuted in Wayne County, Ga., by the Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney\u2019s office. A spokesman for the office, Mark Spaulding, said that any probation violations would be handled by the Georgia Department of Community Supervision.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t initiate those proceedings,\u201d Spaulding said. \u201cThey make the decision whether they think it rises to a violation necessary to bring it back to court.\u201d\n\nTold about the linguistic dispute over the probation condition, Spaulding said, \u201cThat is the basis for why we have to have court hearings.\u201d\n\nBrian Tukes, a DCS spokesman, said the department is reviewing the case with the prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cOnce we can review those special conditions, we can make a determination if his participation is a violation,\u201d Tukes said.\n\nIf it is ruled to be a violation, he said the department could seek an arrest warrant.\n\nHarris, the family attorney, said that Miller\u2019s attorney\u2019s interpretation was \u201chyper technical\u201d and at odds with the clear intent of the provision.\n\n\u201cTheir argument is they\u2019ve created this extremely special exception where Randall Miller gets to be the only director in the history of the world who has no responsibility for safety,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI think it\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\nMiller shot the film, called \u201cHigher Grounds,\u201d in July and August 2019, and it is now in post-production. The film has a pro-vegan message, and follows a woman who seeks to persuade coffee shops to stop using cow\u2019s milk. It was shot primarily in Serbia, with a few days in Colombia and London.\n\nJason Allen, the first assistant director, was designated as the person \u201cin charge of safety.\u201d Allen said he was given \u201cfull and complete asserted authority\u201d over the production\u2019s safety protocol.\n\n\u201c\u2018Higher Grounds\u2019 did not involve complicated stunts,\u201d Allen said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly coffee shops. You have an occasional vehicle. [An actress] rides a scooter \u2014 that was handled extremely safely.\u201d\n\nAllen also said that the film had signatory status with the Directors Guild of America. Miller also served as a producer on the film, and Allen reported to him in that capacity.\n\nJoyce Gilliard, a crew member who was severely injured in the \u201cMidnight Rider\u201d crash, said she was \u201creally pissed\u201d about the situation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how he was able to maneuver filming much less getting financed for a film,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has definitely sent shock waves around the film community here in Georgia and abroad.\u201d\n\nIATSE Local 491, which represents film workers in the Savannah area, is looking into the situation, said board member Bruce Williamson.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re livid,\u201d he said. \u201cThis should not have happened.\u201d\n\nIn the interview, Miller said that everything on the film was handled above board, with cooperation from the DGA, the Screen Actors Guild, the Writers Guild of America, and Equity, the U.K. actors guild.\n\n\u201cThere was no skulking around,\u201d Miller said.\n\nHe said that he had noticed online attacks directed at him and the project in recent days.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d he said. \u201cI continue to be heartbroken over the loss of Sarah and all the hardship that it caused everyone involved with \u2018Midnight Rider\u2019 and their families and friends. But this is what I\u2019ve done for my whole life and I have to try to make a living.\u201d"}}
