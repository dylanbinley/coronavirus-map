According to the most recent data from the World Health Organization, there are 43,103 confirmed cases of the disease, with the vast majority in China. There have been 395 cases throughout 24 countries outside of China, with just 13 of those occurring in the United States.\n\nIn total, the World Health Organization reports there have been 1,018 deaths, with only one of those occurring outside of China.\n\nSo far, six Virginia residents have been tested for COVID-19, but each test came back negative for the disease.\n\nSpillmann said people can take some steps to ensure that they remain healthy."}}
