When we left, the Permanent Secretary took our place and was negotiating with the Joint Negotiating Council on the consequential adjustment.\n\n\u201cThe states are waiting for that, and it is not proper for us not to fast-track that negotiation so that even the states will not have too much back log to pay when the consequential adjustment is concluded.\n\n\u201cWe have on our own budgeted for it in the 2019 budget and we are going to also budget for it in the 2020 budget. We are concerned about the states because some of the states are not proactive like us.\n\n\u201cSo, the sooner we conclude at the Federal level, and the Joint Negotiating Councils in the states takes it from there and negotiate with the states, the better for everybody,\u2019\u2019 he said."}}
