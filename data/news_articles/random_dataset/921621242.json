Last month a pilot broadcast showed proceedings from a High Court of Justice hearing of a petition against digital tracking methods employed by the Shin Bet security agency to trace the whereabouts of coronavirus carriers.\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nOn Sunday and Monday, the High Court broadcast live the hearing against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu forming a government in light of his indictment in three corruption cases, as well as against legislative changes demanded by the emerging coalition deal.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Supreme Court broadcasts are part of a year-long pilot program.\n\nIn normal times, the top US court meets in its stately neo-classical building directly across First Street from the US Capitol.\n\nTwo hundred seats in its marble hearing room are reserved for members of the public, who often line up for hours outside the building\u2019s white-columned facade for the privilege of hearing the nine justices ponder issues that range from the arcane to the history-changing.\n\nIn the courtroom, electronic equipment is strictly banned, and journalists are not allowed to report on the justices\u2019 debates until their conclusion. Official recordings of the proceedings \u2014 audio only \u2014 are posted online only days later.\n\nDespite calls for reform, the court has always refused to allow microphones or cameras, saying it does not want to lend undue weight to hearings, which justices say are often less decisive than the written arguments submitted by lawyers.\n\nBut on Monday for the first time in history, several media outlets, including the Fox and C-Span networks, will broadcast live the exchanges between the justices, each still confined at home, and lawyers arguing cases.\n\nThe pandemic has forced the nine justices \u2014 including progressive Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an octogenarian who has been in fragile health \u2014 to telework for nearly two months.\n\nFor Monday\u2019s hearing, the justices will take part by phone. But with no cameras involved, they won\u2019t have to wear their traditional black robes.\n\n\u201cOver my dead body,\u201d former justice David Souter once famously said about cameras in the courtroom.\n\nTo avoid confusion, the justices will speak in order of their seniority on the court, rather than in their usual impromptu fashion. Television viewers will only see photos of the justices on the screen, above their names.\n\nThe court has not said whether the bailiff will open the hearing with his traditional \u201cOyez, oyez, oyez\u201d call for silence and attention.\n\nThe first case, to be heard starting at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) Monday, will deal with whether the popular travel site Booking.com is allowed to register its name as a trademark \u2014 or whether that would be barred by federal law banning the trademarking of generic terms.\n\nOver the coming two weeks, the court will hear arguments in nine other cases.\n\nThe most highly anticipated, set for May 12, will deal with whether US President Donald Trump\u2019s accountants and bankers can be compelled to turn over his financial records to Congress and New York prosecutors.\n\nTrump has fought to protect his tax records from public scrutiny."}}
