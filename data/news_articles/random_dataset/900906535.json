Each is a certified teacher who does things like run Native American clubs, lead cultural activities and teach Native American literature, among other things.\n\n\"Sometimes this is their only opportunity to see a person that looks like them in their school districts,\u201d Oklahoma Council for Indian Education President-Elect Alison Black said.\n\nBut the number of advisors could drop to three next fiscal year, according to the Indian Education office.\n\nAt a school board meeting Tuesday, advisors said they received letters saying they were being reorganized due to the budget crisis.\n\n\"What I can tell you is that no decisions have been made,\u201d Superintendent Gist said.\n\n\"The students are going to suffer,\u201d Teresa Parker said.\n\nTeresa Parker is one of the resource advisors, and serves as a representative for the Tulsa Classroom Teachers Association.\n\nRelated Story - Tulsa Public Schools Board Votes To Close 4 Schools\n\n\"The way it was explained to us was that the tribes are aware, everyone's aware that this is happening, and this is how it's just gonna be,\u201d Parker said. \u201cBut when we reached out to the tribes they said no, we did not know that this was gonna be happening.\"\n\nMuscogee (Creek) Nation Principal Chief David Hill sent a letter to TPS, expressing his concern.\n\nHe argued the Indian Education Program is federally funded through two grants and said, \"it is unclear why positions within the Program are being eliminated.\"\n\nBut the Indian Education office said it looked at its own budget and based on the number of students who help the district qualify for federal funding, the office is projecting it will only be able to afford three advisors next year.\n\nThe office said the number of students who help qualify for funding has dropped during the last seven years.\n\nIn a statement released at the end of the business day Wednesday, TPS said in part, \u201cThe proposed changes to Indian Education are not intended to reduce expenses but to enhance supports as we see a reduction in federal grant funding (Title VI) due to declining students with eligible 506 forms.\u201d\n\n\"We absolutely are completely dedicated to services to our students and of course that includes our Native students,\u201d Gist said.\n\nThe district also explained the proposed changes in the statement: \u201cThe current team structure includes seven district-based 10-month academic advisors and four site-based teacher assistants. The proposed changes to the team structure would \u2013 if approved by our Board \u2013 shift those roles to three year-round secondary student specialists and eight site-based elementary teacher assistants.\u201d\n\nTPS said it expects to share more information about reductions during a special board meeting in mid-February.\n\nThe following is a full statement from TPS:"}}
