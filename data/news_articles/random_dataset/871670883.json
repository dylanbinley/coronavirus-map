He asked residents of the region of Jermuk to unblock the roads leading to Amulsar.\n\nHe explained his position as follows: the Lydian company, which received a license to operate the mine, will resume construction work no earlier than April 2020, therefore, there is no need to obstruct passage to the mine at the moment.\n\nAnd the exploitation of the field itself can begin only at the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, having granted a license for the development of the Lydian mine, the country has undertaken obligations, and now cannot fail to fulfill them without damaging its reputation.\n\nNikol Pashinyan said that he has taken into account the opinion of concerned residents of the country, but has also considered the opinion of economists who argue the need to maintain a positive image of the country in international economic organizations.\n\nIn addition, the Prime Minister has assured the public they have no reason to protest, since his government does not accept any corruption deals and is concerned about the future of his country and its inhabitants.\n\nWhat else did the prime minister say?\n\nThe main issue is that the government can not prohibit the development of the Amulsar mine.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, we can\u2019t not take into account the anxiety of the public,\u201d Pashinyan noted.\n\nPM Pashinyan said the Armenian government is obliged to systematically monitor all work in the Amulsar mine.\n\nTo this end, the Armenian Ministry of the Environment is going to acquire appropriate equipment by May 2020, which will make it possible to detect violations during the operation of the mine.\n\nAnd since the Lydian company will not continue to work on the territory of the mine until that time, there is no need to rush the government.\n\nNikol Pashinyan spoke of some details of the last meeting with representatives of Lydian Armenia which took place on September 6.\n\nAccording to Pashinyan, the company has committed itself to operating the mine in a safe manner.\n\n\u201cThis means that not a single liter of polluted water will enter the rivers, the air will not be polluted, the groundwater will not be polluted, and there will be no problems with biodiversity. Representatives of the company strongly assure that there will be no negative changes in the environment.\u201d\n\nAnd most importantly: if any violations are detected, the mine will be closed for 90 days.\n\nWhat Pashinyan presented\n\nThe Armenian Prime Minister voiced a number of proposals of how to solve the current situation.\n\nTo begin with, he asked the locals of Jermuk to unblock the roads leading to Amulsar. They blocked them after the revolution of 2018, hoping that the new government would support them and prohibit the development of the field.\n\n\u201cI officially ask the residents of Jermuk to open roads to the mine. I repeat. I\u2019m asking you to open the roads,\u201d, the phrase more than once appeared in the prime minister\u2019s direct appeal.\n\nThen Pashinyan said that the inspection body was instructed to start checks at Amulsar on a number of issues that were voiced at a recent video conference with ELARD \u2013 the consultations company which conducted a comprehensive safety review of the mine\u2019s exploitation:\n\n\u201cA new investigation team has been formed, which will not only double-check the facts, but will also investigate new ones.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Company claiming Armenian gold mine safe for exploitation says another study needed\n\nHow environmentalists reacted\n\nPashinyan\u2019s arguments again did not seem convincing to environmentalists and activists of the SaveAmulsar movement.\n\nEcologist Shirak Buniatyan has already answered Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan about the possible operation of the Amulsar mine.\n\nOn his Facebook page, he wrote that the road to Amulsar will open only in two cases:\n\neither government will abide by the unshakable decision of the Armenian people, adopted a year ago [ed. A speech given by Pashinyan that the mine will not be exploited];\n\nor the authorities will use the methods of their predecessors [ed. Implying the use of force].\n\n\u201cBut if they resort to this vicious practice of the former, then they will kill the popularity of the revolution. Amulsar is our homeland and that\u2019s it\u201d, wrote Buniatyan.\n\nReactions of government officials\n\nAmong the first, one of the richest people in Armenia, the head of the Prosperous Armenia party Gagik Tsarukyan, reacted to Pashinyan\u2019s statements.\n\nAccording to him, the fate of the Amulsar field should be decided by the people. Moreover, he said he himself is ready to go out to a protest against the operation of the mine and join the people:\n\n\u201cYou need to hear the people. If there is consent, open the mine. If this consent does not exist, let it not be worked out. The people live there and will continue living there. How can one ignore their opinion?\u201d\n\nThe MP from the ruling parliamentary faction My Step, the head of the commission on economic issues, Babken Tunyan, agrees that there are currently no legal grounds to ban the operation of the Amulsar mine:\n\n\u201cAt the moment, this decision has been made: there is no need to impede construction work on the mine. I adhered to this point of view from the very beginning \u2026 If during the year additional reasons appear that will allow us to stop the development of the mine, then certain measures will be taken.\u201d\n\nSocial media reaction\n\nThe topic of the exploitation of the Amulsar mine has become one of the most discussed in the Armenian Facebook segment for quite some time.\n\nSocial media users are divided into two camps: some are categorically against the resumption of Amulsar\u2019s development, while others completely trust Pashinyan\u2019s opinion and are of the opinion \u201che knows better\u201d.\n\nHere are some of the comments:\n\n\u201cWe trust our prime minister!\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Prime Minister, you are the leader of our country, and we, your people, unconditionally trust you!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will protest and go to the end! Even at the cost of our lives! \u201d\n\n\u201cStop your manipulations! The tourism sector can bring us much more money than the 10% of Lydian!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe larger half of the population is against it!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this how we are entering the second stage of the revolution?\u201d\n\nOn the Amulsar gold mine\n\nAmulsar mine is the second largest gold deposit in Armenia, and contains about 31 tonnes of ore and 40 tonnes of pure gold.\n\nLydian Armenia discovered the gold mine back in 2005.\n\nUp until 2012, the company was looking for investors and was developing a mine development programme.\n\nThe same year Lydian Armenia and the Armenian government signed an agreement to develop and exploit the mine, and the company received the right to proceed with the project.\n\nProtests against the development of the mine began in 2011.\n\nThey were attended by residents of surrounding settlements and environmentalists, who said that gold mining in the area could have a negative impact on the environment of the city of Jermuk, Lake Sevan and local rivers.\n\nThe initiative group \u2018Jermuk will not become a mine\u2019 was created at the time.\n\nIn 2012, the collection of signatures against the development of the mine began.\n\nActivists repeatedly blocked the attempts of the mining company to approach the mine with heavy equipment. In 2018, they were able to have work at the mine suspended.\n\nThe Investigative Committee of Armenia then opened a case looking into environmental damage, for which an international assessment carried out by Elard was commissioned.\n\nSeveral days ago after the release of Elard\u2019s report, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stated that mining would continue, given the report\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cIf it is true that operating the mine is safe for Sevan and the Jermuk water system, then the project will be implemented. However, if there is a threat, I, as the Prime Minister, will not be able to permit its operation regardless of anything.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the examination concluded that the development of the mine does not contain \u201cuncontrolled risks\u201d. That is, the government had the go ahead to allow gold mining at Amulsar to resume\n\nWhy is the Amulsar mine so important?\n\nThe Lydian company received the right to exploit the Amulsar mine after signing one of the largest investment packages in the history of independent Armenia.\n\nThe structure announced a figure of 325 million dollars, and said 1,300 people would be involved in construction work, and that 770 jobs would be available during the operation stage.\n\nThe development of the mine, according to the company\u2019s estimates, should provide an annual growth rate of 1.4% or $185 million for Armenia\u2019s GDP.\n\nExport figures, according to preliminary estimates, could reach up to $286 million per year."}}
