Ned Lamont deployed the Connecticut National Guard on Monday to convert Southern Connecticut State University\u2019s campus to a regional field hospital.\n\nLamont first activated the Guard before the state saw its first positive coronavirus test on March 8. In addition to existing measures such as equipment distribution, Lamont has mobilized the Guard to convert three sites across the state into hospital reserves in order to maximize treatment capacity for an anticipated uptick in COVID-19 cases. On Tuesday, Guard members began converting SCSU\u2019s Moore Fieldhouse into a 250-bed mobile hospital with help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. As of now, the site is intended to care for non-COVID-19 patients in order to free up space in the Yale New Haven Health System.\n\n\u201cWe have to be ready to take care of COVID-positive patients to the best of our ability, and at the same time, we need to continue the business we\u2019re in,\u201d YNHH CEO Marna Borgstrom said in a press conference with Lamont on Monday. \u201cWe have to make sure we\u2019re here for the people who have always needed us \u2026 as well as these COVID-positive patients.\u201d\n\nRight now, Connecticut hospitals still have enough capacity to care for patients, but the state anticipates a surge of cases that will soon fill a limited number of beds \u2014 especially in Fairfield County, the epicenter of Connecticut\u2019s outbreak, and in New Haven County, which Lamont warned on Monday \u201cis quickly catching up to Fairfield.\u201d The number of confirmed cases in Fairfield County is 1,870 as of Tuesday evening; in New Haven County, 517. The city of New Haven has 121 confirmed cases.\n\nYNHH Media Coordinator Mark D\u2019Antonio did not respond to the News\u2019 request for comment regarding when YNHH anticipates housing non-COVID-19 patients at the SCSU site.\n\nOn Monday, Lamont appointed Borgstrom to the newly-formed Governor\u2019s Health System Response Team. Borgstrom, in addition to the two other appointees \u2014 Hartford Healthcare\u2019s Jeffrey Flaks and Nuvance Health\u2019s John Murphy \u2014 has been consulting with the governor on a \u201cregular basis\u201d since before the state saw its first positive case, according to a press release.\n\nTogether, the three health systems constitute nearly 70 percent of the state\u2019s hospital system. The group will focus on resource and personnel allocation for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nLamont said during Monday\u2019s press conference that he met with Borgstrom, Murphy and Flaks on March 20 and asked them to increase their joint capacity by 50 percent. The SCSU overflow site is the latest development in this effort \u2014 which Lamont suggested would be completed by the end of the week \u2014 and allows YNHH to house non-COVID-19 patients apart from the 306 COVID-19 patients currently in the system as of Monday, according to Borgstrom.\n\nBut even with increased patient capacity, YNHH and hospitals across the state still face constraints.\n\nAssociate clinical professor and doctor at the Yale School of Medicine Thomas Balcezak told the News earlier this month that while YNHH can \u201cflex up and use other places as ICUs,\u201d the hospital is inherently limited by staffing and ventilators. YNHH Clinical Virology Lab Director Marie-Louise Landry said that personal protective equipment also poses a challenge \u2014 the need for masks and other PPE is higher than ever, but supply streams have not met hospital needs.\n\nIn a Tuesday appearance on the radio show \u201cChaz & AJ\u201d on WPLR-FM, Lamont shared Landry\u2019s frustrations.\n\n\u201cI am desperate for this PPE,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes the shipments are rerouted at the last moment \u2026 It has created incredibly erratic supply.\u201d\n\nWhile the SCSU overflow site is a state-led initiative, Connecticut is working in partnership with federal and local governments. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said on Monday that it will reimburse the state for all costs associated with activating the Guard, and Mayor Justin Elicker has extended the city\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cThe city of New Haven is looking forward to supporting the state\u2019s use of Southern as a medical surge site to help decompress the hospital and provide more beds for those in need of care related to COVID-19,\u201d Elicker said on Tuesday. \u201cWe all play a part in reducing the spread of the virus and stand ready to partner in doing so. We are also grateful to the leadership at Southern for opening their campus to support efforts related to COVID-19.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the field hospital, SCSU has made about 2,500 beds available in nine residence halls, according to the New Haven Independent. The university anticipates housing medical staff in one of these halls. The purpose for the others has not yet been determined.\n\nMackenzie Hawkins | mackenzie.hawkins@yale.edu\n\nCharlotte Zimmer | charlotte.zimmer@yale.edu"}}
