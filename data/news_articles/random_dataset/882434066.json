We have alternatives. We have noble and uncorrupt people,\u201d who can govern.\n\n\u2013 \u2018We will stay\u2019 \u2013\n\nMain roads remained closed across the country on Saturday morning, as the army tried to reopen key routes.\n\nNortheast of Beirut, dozens of demonstrators formed a human chain to prevent the army from removing a dirt berm blocking a sea-side road.\n\nIn central Beirut, they sat cross-legged on a key artery that connects the capital to its suburbs and surrounding regions but the army later cleared them and opened the road.\n\nNearby, droves of volunteers swept streets and collected rubbish after protests went late into the night, with people dancing on the street and in and abandoned former movie theatre.\n\nDemonstrators who had slept in tents near Martyrs Square, said they were still defiant on the tenth day of their protest movement, despite attempts by Hezbollah to rattle protesters.\n\n\u201cWe will stay on the streets,\u201d said Rabih al-Zein, a 34-year-old from the Shiite-stronghold of Tyre, which saw unprecedented demonstrations over the past week.\n\n\u201cThe power of the people is stronger than the power of the parties,\u201d he told AFP in central Beirut, adding that Hezbollah supporters would not keep them from demonstrating.\n\nLebanon\u2019s largely sectarian political parties have been wrong-footed by the cross-communal nature of the largely peaceful protests.\n\nWaving Lebanese flags rather than the partisan colours normally paraded at demonstrations, protesters have been demanding the resignation of all of Lebanon\u2019s political leaders.\n\n\u201cAll of them means all,\u201d has been a popular slogan.\n\n\u2013 Counter-demonstrations \u2013\n\nIn recent days, loyalists of Hezbollah and the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) \u2014 a Christian party founded by President Michel Aoun \u2014 mobilised counter-demonstrations across the country, sparking scuffles with demonstrators and journalists.\n\nThe Iran-backed Hezbollah, considered a terrorist organisation by Israel and the United States, is the only movement not to have disarmed after Lebanon\u2019s 15-year civil.\n\nHundreds of its supporters gathered in the group\u2019s strongholds in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and the southern cities of Nabatiyeh and Tyre on Friday after Nasrallah\u2019s speech, brandishing party flags.\n\nIn central Beirut, they clashed with protesters, prompting riot police to intervene to break up the fight.\n\nIn Nabatiyeh on Saturday, dozens of anti-government demonstrators returned to the streets, with a protester saying he was counting on the army and security forces to protect them from party loyalists.\n\nIn a suburb north of Beirut, dozens of FPM loyalists staged a counter-demonstration to express their support for the embattled president.\n\nLebanon endured a devastating civil war that ended in 1990 and many of its current political leaders are former commanders of wartime militias, most of them recruited on sectarian lines.\n\nPersistent deadlock between them has stymied efforts to tackle the deteriorating economy, while the eight-year war in neighbouring Syria has compounded the crisis.\n\nMore than a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population lives in poverty, the World Bank says."}}
