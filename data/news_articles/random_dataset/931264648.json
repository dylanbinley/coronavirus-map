According to the Wisconsin historical society, the statue was created by a Wisconsin native in 1893 to represent devotion and progress.\n\nAfter that statue fell, protesters tore down another which celebrated Hans Christian Heg.\n\nAccording to Historic Madison, Inc., that statue paid tribute to a Civil War hero who fought against the Confederates and created the 15th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry.\n\nThe protests were sparked by the arrest of a 28-year-old man who had entered a downtown restaurant with a bat and blow horn. The arrest led to a struggle on the street which involved several officers."}}
