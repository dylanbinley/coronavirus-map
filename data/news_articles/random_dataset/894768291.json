From there he reportedly began hurling insults at Khashoggi and ordered his men to dispose of the journalist.\n\nThough Qahtani was under investigation, multiple reports suggested that he remained largely free and in contact with the crown prince.\n\nDespite the evidence against Qahtani, he did not stand trial.\n\nMonths before Khashoggi's murder, Qahtani tweeted: \u201cDo you think I make decisions without guidance? I am an employee and a faithful executor of the orders of my lord the king and my lord the faithful crown prince.\u201d\n\nAhmed al-Assiri\n\nAhmed al Asiri was subjected to a trial unlike Qahtani where he was acquitted (AFP)\n\nAhmed al-Assiri, who was deputy head military intelligence, stood trial for his suspected involvement in Khashoggi's murder, but was cleared of charges.\n\nHe was a close ally of Mohammed bin Salman, until his dismissal as international outcry over Khashoggi's dissapearance and death grew.\n\nShalaan al-Shalaan, deputy public prosecutor, said the investigation had concluded Qahtani had coordinated with Assiri to repatriate Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia but not kill him.\n\nSeveral Saudis in the hit squad sent to intercept Khashoggi were members of the Tiger Squad, an elite unit that operated under Assiri and Qahtani's command.\n\nThe Tiger Squad has been used for asssassinations in the past, Middle East Eye revealed, and was named after Assiri himself.\n\n\"Assiri is well-known among his colleagues as 'the Tiger of the South'. Since the coalition's war [on Yemen] the Saudi media also started calling Assiri 'the Beast', and he liked this nickname,\" a Saudi source with intimate knowledge of the unit told MEE.\n\nPrior to taking up his intelligence role, Assiri was the spokesperson for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen.\n\nIn her report on Khashoggi's killing, UN Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard acknowledged there was no \"smoking gun\" directly incriminating Mohammed bin Salman, but said it was almost certain he was aware that a plan to target Khashoggi was underway.\n\nAssiri would not have been able to organise such an operation alone, she argued.\n\n\u201cEvidence points to the 15-person mission to execute Mr Khashoggi requiring significant government coordination, resources and finances,\u201d she wrote in the report.\n\n\u201cWhile the Saudi government claims that these resources were put in place by Ahmed Asiri, every expert consulted finds it inconceivable that an operation of this scale could be implemented without the crown prince being aware, at a minimum, that some sort of mission of a criminal nature, directed at Mr Khashoggi, was being launched.\u201d\n\nMiddle East Eye has previously asked the Saudi government to comment on Callamard's allegations, without response.\n\nMohammad al-Otaibi\n\nMohammad Otaibi was the Saudi consul-general before Khashoggi's murder (Supplied)\n\nFour days after Khashoggi's murder, Mohammed al-Otaibi shot to fame as the man who gave journalists a tour of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\n\nShuffling through cupboards and looking under tables in front of journalists to show that Khashoggi was not inside the consulate, Otaibi insisted the slain Saudi had left the building unharmed.\n\nIn actual fact, Khashoggi had been killed and dismembered in Otaibi's office. Following the murder, the hit squad dined at Otaibi's residence close by, where Turkish investigators believe Khashoggi's remains were incinerated in an oven.\n\nCallamard's report published conversations Otaibi had with Saudi officials days before Khashoggi's murder, where he discussed a \"top-secret mission.\"\n\nAnd like Qahtani, Otaibi was banned from leaving Saudi Arabia and put on a US sanctions list for his suspected involvement in the murder."}}
