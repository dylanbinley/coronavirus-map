Tom Wolf\u2019s statewide shut down of businesses deemed non-essential.\n\nThe Reopen PA rally drew a large crowd on both foot and by car. The crowd was enthusiastic as a steady stream of vehicles rolled by on Third Street honking horns in support. Despite the stay at home order, protesters were shoulder-to-shoulder, many without masks as they cheered speakers, displayed signs and waved flags. The rally lasted a little more than an hour.\n\nThanks for visiting PennLive. Quality local journalism has never been more important. We need your support. Not a subscriber yet?
