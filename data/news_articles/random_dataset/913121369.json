That gave him the authority to suspend state laws, restrict travel and limit public gatherings through mid-April.\n\nThough Kemp shut down Georgia schools until at least the end of the month, he\u2019s been hesitant to use his powers to impose broader limits on gatherings that some local officials have ordered.\n\nAtlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms limited public gatherings to 50 people this week, and lawmakers in Athens-Clarke County discussed imposing a curfew.\n\n\u201cWe are not going there. We have to keep commerce going,\u201d Kemp said, encouraging residents to patronize restaurants that exercise social distancing. Asked at what point he could order new restrictions, Kemp said it\u2019s still too early.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a really, really tough call. It will be interesting to see if the federal government does anything in that regard. What we\u2019re doing is continuing to watch the data from around the state,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd right now there\u2019s no reason for a statewide mandate.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump this week recommended that gatherings be limited to 10 people, though he didn\u2019t issue any order to do so.\n\nKemp also told the station he has no plans to immediately offer state incentives for struggling businesses, which typically falls on the federal government during a national emergency.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking people to support small businesses, and one reason I\u2019m asking them not to close.\u201d"}}
