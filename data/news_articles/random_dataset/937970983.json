A total of 8,777 individuals have died from COVID-19 and 131,161 cases have recovered.\n\nBetween 4 April and 27 July, 56,660 Venezuelans are known to have returned to Venezuela from or via Colombia.\n\nThe Constitutional Court delivered a follow-up decision concerning its sentence T-025 from 2004 on the Unconstitutional State of Affairs on Internal Displacement, urging the national government to ensure that IDPs have access to programmes and services related to the COVID-19 response.\n\nAs per UNHCR monitoring, during the month of June there were 18 reported cases of evictions (17 in Arauca and 1 in Tame) affecting 82 Venezuelans. Another 3 Venezuelans were identified as being at risk of eviction. In Apartad\u00f3, UNHCR has identified 65 cases of evictions of Venezuelans, which are being addressed through the Ombudsperson\u2019s Office. Moreover, the GIFMM has registered 182 incidents of evictions, (overwhelmingly among Venezuelan refugees and migrants but also including a small percentage of Colombian-Venezuelan families and Colombian returnees) affecting a total of 753 individuals, with an additional 221 individuals at risk of eviction; further details can be viewed here. UNHCR has developed an Action Plan to address situations of evictions, outlining institutions and steps to advocate at the local, national and interagency levels.\n\nFollowing confrontations between ELN and the Rastrojos, 70 Venezuelans were displaced on 24 June to Banco de Arena, a rural area near Cucuta.

On 24 July, UNHCR conducted a monitoring mission and distribution of humanitarian assistance together with GIFMM partners, assisting 50 families (168 individuals) of Venezuelan refugees and migrants, including 15 indigenous Wayuu families, as well as displaced Colombian people. A delegate from the C\u00facuta Mayor's Office indicated that a response under Law 1448 will be activated, and that the people will be relocated to another space with more adequate conditions and that accompaniment will be provided for those wishing to return to their farms or relocating to other parts of Colombia.\n\nIn Pasto, protests took place by migrants of various nationalities (121 Haitians, 12 Brazilians, 8 Chileans, 2 Congolese and 2 Angolans), demanding the establishment of a humanitarian corridor to enter Panama. Migraci\u00f3n Colombia issued 6 letters of safe-conduct to enable pregnant women to access healthcare.
