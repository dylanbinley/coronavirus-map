(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nStone\u2019s prison sentence stems from former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, which Trump has routinely depicted as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nTrump claimed that Stone was \u201cnever involved\u201d in his campaign for president.\n\n\u201cRoger's definitely a character,\u201d the president mused. \u201cEverybody sort of knows Roger. He's a smart guy. He's a little different. But those are sometimes the most interesting. But he\u2019s a good person. His family is fantastic.\u201d\n\nRoger Stone arrives for his sentencing at U.S. District Court in Washington on Thursday. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nThe president then went on to attack the forewoman of the jury as \u201can anti-Trump activist.\"\n\n\u201cShe had a horrible social media account,\u201d he declared. \u201cThe things she said on the account were unbelievable.\u201d\n\nStone\u2019s defense team, which could have moved to dismiss any juror, opted not to do so, but Trump decried what he described as an unfair trial.\n\n\u201cThis has not been a fair process,\u201d the president added.\n\nLast week, Trump called the DOJ\u2019s initial recommendation by prosecutors that Stone receive at least seven years in prison a \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d\n\nAttorney General William Barr then revised that recommendation, leading to widespread criticism that the president had interfered in the case. All four of the lead prosecutors resigned from the proceedings in protest.\n\nBut in an interview with ABC News that aired last week, Barr offered a rare rebuke of the president, saying such tweets made his job \u201cimpossible,\u201d and made a request.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,\u201d Barr said.\n\nTrump disregarded the warning, comparing Stone\u2019s crimes to allegations of impropriety against former FBI Director James Comey, ex-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and Hillary Clinton in a tweet published during Stone\u2019s sentencing.\n\n\u201cThey say Roger Stone lied to Congress.\u201d @CNN OH, I see, but so did Comey (and he also leaked classified information, for which almost everyone, other than Crooked Hillary Clinton, goes to jail for a long time), and so did Andy McCabe, who also lied to the FBI! FAIRNESS? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2020\n\nIn announcing Stone\u2019s sentence, U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson threw shade at Trump without mentioning his name.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing unfair, phony or disgraceful about the investigation or the prosecution,\u201d she said, adding that the comments from someone with a \u201clong-standing\u201d relationship with Stone were \u201centirely inappropriate.\u201d\n\nAfter the judge handed down her sentence, Stone spokesperson Kristin Davis called on Trump to issue a pardon to his friend.\n\n\u201cIt falls on President Trump to use the power of a pardon as the final means of checks and balances to right this horrible wrong,\u201d Davis said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the president dismissed the suggestion that he was meddling in the Stone matter but claimed he had the right to do so.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually, I guess, the chief law enforcement officer of the country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI could be involved if I wanted to.\u201d\n\nHe was also asked whether he had considered pardoning Stone after issuing clemency to or commuting the sentences of 11 individuals, including some who were backed by financiers of his reelection campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even thinking about that,\u201d Trump said.\n\n_______\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:"}}
