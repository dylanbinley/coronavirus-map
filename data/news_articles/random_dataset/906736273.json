Dynamic Yield\u2019s solution can also analyse a customer\u2019s previous order history and buying behaviour to make recommendations, as well as cross and upsell.\n\nThis kind of customer insight can prove to be a formidable sales tool, increasing conversions, developing customer loyalty and making the buying journey even slicker in a market where speed is a key differentiator.\n\nWe can safely assume that these are the primary, short-term goals of McDonald\u2019s data-lead approach. For clues about the longer term, however, you need only consider how other big corporations have leveraged customer data in order to help them to modify and diversify their business models in new and highly profitable ways.\n\nLuxury brand Louis Vuitton, for example, has publicly stated that the future of luxury isn\u2019t simply about selling products, but also about selling experiences and extending lifestyles. To this end Louis Vuitton is diversifying into the luxury hospitality and catering sector and is reported to be planning a \u00a3500m hotel in Mayfair. If granted planning permission it will be London\u2019s most expensive hotel ever. Vuitton is also in the process of opening a string of new caf\u00e9s, including on the top floor of its new four-storey Osaka store.\n\nOther companies diversifying beyond their traditional sectors include US luxury goods brand Shinola which has opened a hotel in Detroit and features an on-premise gym partnership with fitness disruptor Peloton.\n\nIt\u2019s exactly these types of lifestyle extensions that digital pioneers like McDonald\u2019s can benefit from. With hospitality and catering companies becoming data driven, they are no longer bound by traditional category definitions, allowing them the opportunity to branch out and create a broader lifestyle around their brand.\n\nGuided by rich customer insights companies such as McDonald\u2019s will be able to translate their brands\u2019 value proposition into offerings that go beyond the product, towards community building and long-term engagement. As companies build lifestyles around their products, the key consideration is using customer data to ensure they stay on brand to not extend too far.\n\nThe US fast food chain Taco Bell is another great example of a restaurant chain that is eyeing the hotel market. It opened a pop-up Bell Hotel at the converted Palm Springs Hotel in California in spring 2019, making it clear that the venture was neither a stunt nor a one off. The company has been spurred on by the fact that all room availability was snapped up within hours of going on sale.\n\nOf course, you don\u2019t need a long memory to remember that McDonald\u2019s opened two hotels in Switzerland 2001, only to close both locations less than two years later. Now however, armed with unparalleled levels of customer data and the lessons learned from its first foray the fast food giant is perfectly placed to create new revenue streams and diversify profitably into new sectors like never before.\n\nIn the race to reimagine and redefine catering and hospitality brands\u2019 value proposition during 2020, only those companies with powerful digital networks will be able leverage transformative technology such as personalisation and artificial intelligence. This will arguably have the greatest impact in the fast-food sector where consumers will expect increasingly customer-centric and friction free experiences.\n\nPersonalisation, driven by modern digital networks, presents huge opportunities for both hospitality and catering firms.
