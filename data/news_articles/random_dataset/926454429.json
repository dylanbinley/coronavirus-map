The show of force came after three days where police mostly declined to engage with protesters.\n\nIt also came after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard members and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000.\n\nAs Minneapolis streets appeared largely quiet, Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the heavy response would remain as long as it takes to \u201cquell this situation.\u201d\n\nFloyd, a handcuffed black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes.\n\nStory continues\n\n___\n\nRICHMOND, Va. \u2014 The Richmond, Virginia, police headquarters was the target of protesters for the second night in a row as officers formed a barricade around the building late Saturday night.\n\nA dumpster was set afire near the police headquarters, which had its front windows broken out Friday night.
