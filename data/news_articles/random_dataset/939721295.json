Bouiachi was indicted on rape charges last year. After being released due to the pandemic, police say he shot and killed his accuser.\n\nALEXANDRIA, Va. \u2014 Ibrahm E. Bouaichi died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound that severely hurt the man Wednesday. Police confirmed the news to WUSA9 on Saturday.\n\nPolice in Virginia say that Bouaichi, a rape suspect released from jail in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, went on to kill the woman who had accused him.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Bouaichi was tracked down by authorities on Wednesday. But he shot himself and was in grave condition on Thursday.\n\nBouaichi was indicted last year on charges that included rape, strangulation and abduction. He was jailed without bond in Alexandria.\n\nThe woman testified against him in Alexandria District Court in December.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, Bouaichi\u2019s lawyers argued that he should be freed awaiting trial because the virus endangered both inmates and their attorneys. He was released on $25,000 bond over the objections of a prosecutor.\n\nAlexandria Police Department Announces Homicide Suspect Has Been Taken Into Custody: https://t.co/THA1cXi79t \u2014 Alexandria Police (@AlexandriaVAPD) August 5, 2020\n\nCircuit Court Judge Nolan Dawkins released Bouaichi on the condition that he only leave his Maryland home to meet with his lawyers or pretrial services officials.\n\nAlexandria police say that Bouaichi, 33, fatally shot the woman in late July.\n\nAuthorities said that federal marshals and Alexandria police spotted and pursued Bouaichi in Prince George\u2019s County on Wednesday. He crashed his vehicle and apparently shot himself, authorities said.\n\nJudge Dawkins retired in June. He did not respond to The Washington Post's request for comment. Judges are often prohibited from commenting on pending cases.\n\nBouaichi's attorneys, Manuel Leiva and Frank Salvato said in a statement that they were \u201ccertainly saddened by the tragedy both families have suffered here.\u201d\n\nThe lawyers said they \u201cwere looking forward to trial. Unfortunately, the pandemic continued the trial date by several months and we didn\u2019t get the chance to put forth our case.\u201d"}}
