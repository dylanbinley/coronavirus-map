She accused him of \u201cintimidating behavior\u201d including a social media post that included a picture of her with what looked like gun crosshairs over her head. Stone blamed staff for the Instagram post, but the judge sharply rebuked him.\n\n\u201cHe knew exactly what he was doing,\u201d Jackson said, adding that it \u201cwas designed to disrupt\u201d the proceedings.\n\nShe is exaggerating the dopey comments Stone made and makes, and will likely throw the book at him.\n\nShe is looking at a strong sentence.\n\nJohn Cardillo of Newsmax TV tweeted, \u201cRogerStone\u2019s Judge Amy Berman Jackson claiming that he threatened her and impeded justice is beyond dumb considering she suppressed his 1A rights, he was convicted by a biased jury and she\u2019s sentencing him. This should terrify every American.\u201d\n\nAs he entered the court, supporters, and enemies shouted out:\n\nNEW: Roger Stone arrives at a DC courthouse for expected sentencing on his conviction for witness tampering and lying to Congress. A few onlookers yelled \u201cTraitor!\u201d at him as entered the building. https://t.co/hQObmjkcfA pic.twitter.com/1QQxwc7jla \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) February 20, 2020\n\nThe President weighed in during the sentencing hearing, comparing Stone\u2019s case to liars like Comey, Hillary Clinton, and McCabe.\n\n\u201cThey say Roger Stone lied to Congress.\u201d @CNN OH, I see, but so did Comey (and he also leaked classified information, for which almost everyone, other than Crooked Hillary Clinton, goes to jail for a long time), and so did Andy McCabe, who also lied to the FBI! FAIRNESS? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2020\n\nThe judge won\u2019t execute the sentence today until she rules on the new trial he has requested. However, the DOJ is against a new trial. She will reject the mistrial and probably give him too stiff a sentence.\n\nGive him a pardon!"}}
