The truck didn\u2019t come to a stop until it smashed into a rental car counter.\n\nAlso Watch: Woman Running In Dallas Interstate Triggers Pickup Crash\n\nLuckily, there were no travelers in the vicinity at the time of the crash. Monsivis suffered serious injuries and as of last week, was being treated at Sarasota Memorial Hospital. Security vision captured the moment the pickup truck slammed into the rental car counter where two people were working. They were shaken up but not injured, Piccolo said.\n\nThe Florida Highway Patrol claim the New College police department noticed Monsivis driving in a \u201creckless manner\u201d north on U.S. 41 before making his way to the airport. He reportedly turned east near Edwards Drive, smashed through a chain-link fence on the airport\u2019s western boundary and raced down a utility road before hitting the terminal wall.\n\nPiccolo estimated damages to be roughly $250,000, including one of the baggage belts that was destroyed by the pickup.\n\nMonsivis is going to have a hard time explaining this to his insurance company."}}
