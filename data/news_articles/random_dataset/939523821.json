Kennedy, who has denied wrongdoing by Hale, said it was \u201cappalling\u201d that Dick would seek lost wages during a pandemic.\n\nHale has maintained that Dick provoked him into hitting him by grabbing Hale\u2019s genitals and winking at him outside the club where Dick had performed. Dick has denied he touched Hale.\n\nOn July 28, the New Orleans district attorney's office said it was dropping prosecution of Hale because Dick had not been cooperative and had not kept in touch with prosecutors.\n\nA district attorney spokesman, Ken Daley, said the case could be revived if Dick reestablishes contact with the district attorney\u2019s office. Dick later said he would be willing to come to New Orleans to testify against Hale."}}
