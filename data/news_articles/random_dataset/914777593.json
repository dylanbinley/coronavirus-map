I study infectious diseases,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019s horrifying. We\u2019re witnessing a historic event, a calamity.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty could be crippling. Bergam saw her internship with the World Health Organization in Geneva dry up.\n\nInstead of succumbing to dread, however, she bought a $20 bike and began exploring Rhode Island.\n\nTerrifying is the word used by Ian Weiner, a senior at the University of Rhode Island, to describe his future.\n\n\u201cQuite literally, the whole economy is shutting down,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if I wasn\u2019t going to find a full-time job, I could have found something in a grocery store or a restaurant. But now I can\u2019t even do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cLiterally the only option I have is moving back to my parents\u2019 house in Maryland, for which I am very fortunate,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, he and his roommates are staying home.\n\n\u201cExcept for walks on the beach, we haven\u2019t left the house in two weeks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMost of us are taking this very seriously,\u201d he said. \u201c Personally, I think it\u2019s a paradox. My generation has been warning about climate change for a long time and no one listened. Now you [older adults] know what it feels like to be not listened to.\n\n\u201cThis whole experience shows us that we have to work generationally if we want to fix things. If not, this will get worse.\u201d\n\nAmadi Umi, a senior and criminal justice major from Salve University, said she feels blessed because she will return to campus next year to finish a five-year program.\n\nBut she will sorely miss the pomp and circumstance of commencement. No senior night at O\u2019Brien\u2019s Pub on Thames Street, no commencement ball.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the realization that I may never see some of my friends again,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad.\u201d\n\nUmi, who is back home in Maryland, is taking care of herself, binge watching \u201cLove is Blind\u201d and snacking, lots of snacking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been able to be positive in stressful times because of my family,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m surrounding myself with people I love.\u201d\n\nlborg@providencejournal.com\n\n(401) 277-7823\n\nOn Twitter: @lborgprojocom\n\nSalve Regina senior Amadi Umi is sad about \u201cthe realization that I may never see some of my friends again.\u201d [The Providence Journal / Linda Borg]"}}
