Mark Gordon said in a statement announcing the changes Tuesday. \u201cIsolation can be debilitating for our seniors. I\u2019m glad we are able to take this step to make in-person visits possible in a safe manner.\u201d\n\nThe new requirements allow in-person visitation of two people in outdoor settings. The visitors must be screened for symptoms, and a trained staff member must be present throughout the visit. Staff and residents are required to wear surgical masks, and visitors have to don face coverings.\n\nIn the press release, officials said that they hope to test 100% of residents and staff for the virus. The facilities have been the most heavily tested spots in Wyoming; any cases linked to a particular organization has prompted a swift response by the state that has included a broad collection of samples, which are processed at an expedited pace."}}
