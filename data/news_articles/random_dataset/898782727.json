Police found him after airborne search crews discovered an SOS message written in the snow near a makeshift shelter Steele had reportedly survived in.\n\nSteele was reported missing in mid-December after his cabin outside of Skwentna had burned down. He told police he had put a large piece of cardboard in his wood stove and suspected a spark caused the roof to ignite. It quickly spread and engulfed the cabin before he could call for help in putting it out.\n\nIt also killed his chocolate lab, Phil.\n\nSteele built a makeshift shelter and was able to gather food that hadn\u2019t been consumed in the fire. He reportedly put off eating some of the charred canned food he found for as long as possible.\n\n\u201cLast night\u2019s meal was probably one of the worst,\u201d Steele was quoted as saying by Alaska State Troopers public information officer, Ken Marsh. \u201cI was leaving the burned-off stuff for the last. And last night\u2019s dinner was a can of plastic-smoked refried beans. No hickory, no mesquite, (he laughs) it\u2019s Class A waterproof tarp (flavor).\u201d\n\nSteele was airlifted by police to Anchorage to be examined, where he also got a shower and McDonald's No. 2 combo. He also said he\u2019d \u201cprobably\u201d head to Utah to be with his family."}}
