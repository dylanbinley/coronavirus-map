Who will replace Kim Jong Un in North Korea?", "TEXT": "Kim Yo Jong has long been her brother\u2019s closest confidante and adviser, but there\u2019s a lot the world doesn\u2019t know about her.\n\nPYONGYANG, North Korea \u2014 Nuclear weapons and a million-man army \u2013 They\u2019re the reasons why North Korea has been a thorn in America\u2019s side for decades.\n\nGenerations of iron-fisted dictators have repeatedly brought the world to the brink in desperate attempts to maintain power, while keeping their country almost completely cut off from the outside world.\n\nSo, as rumors about Kim Jong Un\u2019s possible death sweep the planet, there\u2019s really just one question that needs to be answered.\n\nIf we find out he's actually dead, then who\u2019s next?\n\nBut first, it\u2019s important to understand how we got here.\n\nAfter invading South Korea and turning the Cold War into a gruesome battle, North Korea\u2019s founder, Kim Il Sung, spent the rest of his life-transforming his impoverished country into a hermit kingdom \u2013 and laying the groundwork for a dynasty.\n\nWhen he died in 1994, his son rose to power.\n\nKim Jong Il ruled North Korea for 17 years and spent billions of dollars developing North Korea\u2019s now-infamous nuclear program, while millions of his people starved to death in a nationwide famine.\n\nHe died in 2011 from a heart attack and handed the reigns to his son, Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe younger Kim has managed to keep his rock-solid grip on power ever since. He increased North Korea\u2019s arsenal while threatening the United States with nuclear war. Then, he did the unthinkable \u2013 meeting face-to-face with an American president.\n\nKim Jong Un and President Donald Trump shook hands and sat down behind closed doors in 2018 during a historic summit in Singapore. The two leaders met again the following year in Vietnam and later met along the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.\n\nBut, despite Kim\u2019s apparent willingness to shine a little light onto his closed-off country, there\u2019s still a lot the world doesn\u2019t know about him.\n\nWe don\u2019t even know how old he is.\n\nIt\u2019s believed he\u2019s in his late 30s, so reports of his death after a failed heart procedure may have caught a lot of people off guard. Now, the world is waiting to find out who will succeed him. Most analysts seem to agree Kim Jong Un\u2019s younger sister is a likely person to take over.\n\nSo, who is Kim Yo Jong?\n\nAccording to Forbes, she\u2019s in her early 30s, she went to school in Switzerland and has long been her brother\u2019s closest confidante and adviser. She was there for both Trump-Kim summits and even represented North Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.\n\nNewsweek reports Kim Yo Jong\u2019s current title is vice-department director of the Korean Workers\u2019 Party Central Committee. Basically, she\u2019s responsible for overseeing North Korean propaganda.\n\n\u201cAmong the North\u2019s power elite, Kim Yo Jong has the highest chance to inherit power, and I think that possibility is more than 90 percent,\u201d Cheong Seong-Chang from the Sejong Institute in South Korea told the Associated Press.\n\nReuters reports Kim Yo Jong has \"firm control of key party functions.\"\n\nShe's been \"groomed for years to serve as a regent\" for Kim Jong Un if he dies or gets incapacitated while waiting for his son -- who is around 10 years old -- to assume power, according to The Daily Beast.\n\nAmericans in charge of predicting the outcome appear to agree.\n\n\u201cI think the basic assumption would be that maybe it would be someone in the family,\u201d U.S. national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien told the AP.\n\n\u201cBut again, it\u2019s too early to talk about that because we just don\u2019t know, you know, what condition Chairman Kim is in and we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out.\u201d\n\nWhat other people are reading right now:\n\n"}}
