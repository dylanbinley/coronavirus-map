being escorted directly into a police car Credit: AFP\n\n8 The shooter killed two people after failing to enter a synagogue in Halle on Yom Kippur Credit: Reuters\n\nThe gunman, named locally as Stephan Balliet, 27, attempted to storm a synagogue in Halle where dozens were observing Judaism's holiest day.\n\nAfter failing to get in, he killed a 40-year-old German woman in the street outside and a 20-year-old man at a nearby kebab shop.\n\n'THIS WAS TERROR'\n\nThe shooter live-streamed his atrocities to Amazon Twitch, telling viewers he wanted to \"kill as many Jews as possible\".\n\nA 35 minute live-stream of the Yom Kippur rampage, which unfolded at midday on Wednesday, was uploaded to the video sharing platform where it remained for 30 minutes after the stream finished.\n\nIn the footage he was seen denying the holocaust and ranting about feminism and immigration before going on his killing spree.\n\nBalliet was later arrested by police after trying to flee the scene in a taxi.\n\nThe attempted synagogue attack was also captured on a surveillance camera, said Max Privorotzki, leader of the local Jewish community.\n\nMr Privorotzki said there were 70 or 80 people inside at the time of the attack.\n\nPeter Frank, Germany's chief federal prosecutor, said: \"What we experienced yesterday was terror.\n\n\"The suspect, Stephan B., aimed to carry out a massacre in the synagogue in Halle.\"\n\n'HOMEMADE' WEAPONS\n\nFrank said the weapons were \"apparently homemade\" and the explosives were in \"numerous devices\" found in the car.\n\nHe \"wanted to create a worldwide effect\" by emulating attackers such as the man who killed 51 people in mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March and by encouraging others to imitate his own actions in Halle, the prosecutor added.\n\nPreviously unknown to German authorities, he is being held on suspicion of two counts of murder, nine of attempted murder and other offenses, Frank said.\n\nHeiko Maas, Germany's minister for foreign affairs, led tributes last night, saying: \"A shooting at Halle synagogue on Yom Kippur hits us all in the heart.\"\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel also attended a vigil for the victims in Berlin.\n\n8 Stephan Balliet has been named locally as the suspect in the Halle shooting Credit: Twitter\n\n8 The shooter live streamed his attack to video sharing site Twitch Credit:

News\n\nAmazon Twitch has faced criticism for not removing footage of the rampage more quickly.\n\nMore than 2,000 people viewed the hateful footage and it was shared to other platforms including Telegram and 4chan.\n\nCALLS FOR STRONGER REGULATION\n\nLast night there were calls for social media sites to take action to stop their platforms being used for violence.\n\nHans-Jakob Schindler of the Counter Extremism Project told the MailOnline: \u201cAmazon is just as much to blame as Twitch for allowing this stream online.\n\n\u201cOnline platforms need to step up and stop their services being used and in turn, parent companies need to hold them accountable.\n\n\u201cThis tragic incident demonstrates one more time that a self-regulatory approach is not effective enough and sadly highlights the need for stronger regulation of the tech sector.\u201d\n\nA Twitch spokesman said: \u201cWe are shocked and saddened by the tragedy that took place in Germany today, and our deepest condolences go out to all those affected.\n\n\u201cTwitch has a zero-tolerance policy against hateful conduct, and any act of violence is taken extremely seriously.\n\nWhat is Twitch?
