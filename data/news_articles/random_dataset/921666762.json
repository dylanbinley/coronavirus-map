On Sunday, the president of people who refuse to social distance because they have to get to Cracker Barrel retweeted a conspiracy theory that President Obama was really the one running the \u201cRussian hoax.\u201d Yes, Trump really believes that in-between loving his beautiful wife and kids, enjoying retirement, buying all the slim-fit jeans in Neiman Marcus and basically stunting on America by posting presidential thirst traps on the \u2019gram, that Obama somehow gives a fuck about this dismal-ass administration.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president of people with heavy addictions to Mountain Dew tweeted out some rando podcaster\u2019s crazy claims that somehow Obama was at the center of it all. Look, it\u2019s all caca, and if you want to go down that rabbit hole be my guest, but I can\u2019t in good faith link to that foolishness or even waste any brain bandwidth trying to explain.\n\n\n\nThe point is that Lemon, who is usually affable and in good spirits, took on a different tone when asking President Trump, \u201cFuck is wrong with you?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLemon called Trump\u2019s latest attempts to drag Obama\u2019s good name \u201ca new low from a president who goes low all the time,\u201d the Daily Beast reports. Lemon also took a moment to praise former President George W. Bush, who used to be one of America\u2019s biggest embarrassments until...well, you get it. Bush recently released a message urging Americans to unite, and well, that doesn\u2019t sound like much but it\u2019s huge when the current president could give a shit about uniting unless America being united somehow added to his press briefing viewership; then, he\u2019s all about it.\n\n\u201cIn the final analysis, we are not partisan combatants. We are human beings, equally vulnerable and equally wonderful in the sight of God,\u201d Bush said, the Hill notes. \u201cWe rise or fall together, and we are determined to rise.\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t want to hear it. In fact, Trump was upset that the former president was more concerned with lives lost to the coronavirus than the most important life in the world\u2014to an egomaniacal narcissist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, Lemon had reached his tipping point with all of Trump\u2019s bullshit, and in a clip that is going viral on Twitter, the CNN host looked into the camera and asked the president, seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you and your unhealthy obsession with Obama?\n\n\u201cWhat is it about President Obama that really gets under your skin? Is it because he\u2019s smarter than you? Better educated? Made it on his own\u2014didn\u2019t need daddy\u2019s help? Wife is more accomplished? Better looking? I don\u2019t know, what is it, what is it about him? That he\u2019s a black man that\u2019s accomplished being president? That he punked you on the whole birth certificate thing? What is it about him? Just wondering.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch below, and let\u2019s try to remember back to a time when the stock market wasn\u2019t in the toilet, the world didn\u2019t have to wear masks (except Vice President Mike Pence, who may or may not be a robot) and the president wasn\u2019t a racist bag of vomit."}}
