We just signed an LOI [letter of intent] with a great company.'\n\n'They want to buy the app, continue growing it for our millions of users, and take the Kin integration to the next level. Not a done deal yet, but could be a great win win. More soon,' the tweet continued.\n\nThe Canada-based app, which is reportedly used by 300 million people, has been troubled by accusations it is a haven for child abusers but this does not appear to be linked to the decision to shut it down.\n\nWhen Kik Interactive launched its blockchain cryptocurrency, Kin, the SEC alleges it did so to try and claw back money it was losing through running its messaging app.\n\nThe messaging app was facing a lawsuit from the US Government over the way it was selling cryptocurrency to customers \u2013 and the only way out was to label Kin a security or fight them in court\n\nThe government said it was illegal for the company to sell the Kin tokens \u2013 it sold a trillion of them for $55 million to buyers in the US \u2013 because they didn't technically exist and the sales weren't registered with the SEC.\n\nWHAT IS KIK MESSENGER? Instant messaging app Kik is a service similar to Whatsapp. It is popular with children primarily for features that allow you to join groups, send emojis, make memes, play games and listen to music. However, it is possible to find and chat with total strangers, and you can even search for public groups aimed at teenagers wanting to chat. The app has more than 15 million monthly users and doesn't require a telephone number or your real name to sign up. The app has attracted a barrage of criticism and has been linked to sex offences against children up and down the country. Security experts have warned parents to monitor their children's use of Kik, due to its added levels of anonymity.

How they would pressure exchanges not to list Kin. And how they would draw out a long and expensive process to drain our resources.'\n\nIn that post, Livingston said the Kik app would be shut down and the business would be reduced to 19 'elite employees' from more than 100 people.\n\nThis was intended to cut the company's outgoings by 85 percent and make sure it can afford to survive its pending lawsuit.\n\nThe company's name has been tarnished in recent years by allegations that child porn is shared on its messaging app.\n\nDespite the app's links to child sex abuse cases, the UK's NSPCC children's charity last year ranked Kik among the safest social media sites/apps for children to use, with youngsters less likely to be exposed to content about suicide, violence, bullying or drink or drugs than other sites such as Reddit, YouTube or Facebook\n\nA BBC investigation last year found that Kik, which is particularly popular among teenagers, had been featured in more than 1,100 child sexual abuse cases in five years.\n\nFreedom of Information responses from 29 police forces in the UK revealed that 28 of them had dealt with sexual abuse cases involving the app.\n\nAmong them they had 1,147 investigations into child sexual exploitation, grooming or 'image offences', presumed to be the sharing of illegal porn."}}
