Tear gas could raise the risk of new infections in two ways: First, it is an irritant that causes those exposed to cough, so it could lead an infected person to emit more droplets, thereby transmitting the virus to more people.\n\nTear gas is \"an agent that increases mucus production, that causes your eyes to water, your nose to run,\" Dr. Howie Mell, an emergency physician practicing near St. Louis, told Business Insider.\n\n\"The mucus produced in your nose is known to be a reservoir for virus,\" he added.\n\nSecond, tear gas may cause damage to people's throats and lungs, according to studies, and that could make them more susceptible to getting infected with a respiratory illness like the coronavirus.\n\nTear gas triggers coughing, which can spray coronavirus particles\n\nTear gas is a chemical agent, and it's banned from international warfare. It causes people to experience burning in the eyes, noses, throat, lungs, and skin.\n\nTechnically, the chemical is actually a solid, white powder that can be aerosolized when mixed with a solvent. When it's combined with water, sweat, and oils in our skin, it dissolves into a painful, acidic liquid.\n\nDr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician in New York City, told USA Today that tear gas could also be considered a nerve agent, since it activates specific pain receptors in affected areas.\n\nProtesters are tear gassed as the police disperse them near the White House on June 1, 2020.

The virus travels between people in tiny droplets of saliva and mucus, which typically spread 3 to 5 feet. If a sick person sneezes, coughs, or eats within that distance of someone healthy, the particles could land on them; if the particles enter the person's eyes, nose, or mouth, the person can become infected.\n\n\"It's very, very irritating to the upper respiratory passages and it's going to make people cough and sneeze,\" Dr. Dean Winslow, an infectious-disease physician at Stanford Health Care, previously told Business Insider. \"I would certainly discourage law enforcement from using those sorts of riot-control techniques.\"\n\nBecause people can pass the coronavirus before they show symptoms, or might never feel ill, it's possible that protesters wouldn't realize they're infected before attending an event.\n\nSome studies have linked tear-gas exposure to respiratory illness diagnosis\n\nSome case studies have shown that people exposed to tear gas are significantly more likely to become sick with a respiratory illness afterward.\n\nA study from the US Army found that soldiers who had been exposed to tear gas during basic training had a significantly higher risk of being diagnosed with an acute respiratory illness after that exposure. The incidence of illness was correlated with how much tear gas a person was exposed to.\n\nSimilarly, a Turkish study found that people who were exposed to tear gas faced a higher risk of chronic bronchitis in the long term.\n\nHealth workers in protective gear peer from a tent constructed to test people for the coronavirus outside the Brooklyn Hospital Center in Brooklyn, New York City, March 27, 2020.
