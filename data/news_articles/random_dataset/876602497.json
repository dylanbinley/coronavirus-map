They made their NWA debut earlier this year as one of the teams in the rebooted Crockett Cup Wildcard Battle Royal to kick off the event (which was ultimately won by the new NWA World Tag Team Champions, The Wildcards, featuring Royce Isaacs & Thomas Latimer).\n\nOUTLAW INC. (Eddie Kingston & Homicide)\n\nEddie Kingston had previously announced he was heading to the NWA tapings, but he never said who his partner would be.
