You can understand, in that M&A transactions space, why that information would be a particular target for individuals to take,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve [also] had a couple of criminal law firms and family law firms where data has been disclosed online because somebody has been able to get into their systems and take it, and when you actually pull through the details, you realise that that law firms will have details of who have taken out AVOs, or who are defendants of AVOs.\u201d\n\nAnother issue for law firms beyond data misuse from a privacy perspective, Mr Corbett-Wilkins continued, is that \u201cas an ancillary part of our function, we either hold monies on trust for our clients\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo, we ultimately direct money used to flow between two parties to a transaction, and what we\u2019re seeing at the moment is a huge amount of invoice fraud, where funds are effectively misdirected from the intended recipients to the criminal\u2019s bank account purely because someone\u2019s able to get into the law firm systems and ultimately change those instructions whether it\u2019s an email or an invoice or whatever it might be,\u201d he explained.\n\nIt was put to Mr Corbett-Wilkins that, based on such hypotheticals or even real-life scenarios, firms could face class actions from their entire client base if such data breaches were to occur.\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT\n\n\u201cWe are seeing at least claims being brought against law firms, particularly for that misdirection of funds, but also for loss of data,\u201d he responded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s effectively about professional indemnity risk and saying to law firms, \u2018You have an obligation to protect confidentiality. You have an obligation to provide services in a professional manner. And frankly, you failed to do so because you didn\u2019t have appropriate systems or processes in place to protect the data\u2019.\n\n\u201cI think the inherent difficulty is that lawyers are obviously all very intelligent and very able to deal with their subject matter expertise in a very good way, but there is a missing link with education around security frameworks that sit around all of the good work that we otherwise do to protect ourselves as a profession.\u201d\n\nThis must apply to law firms of all sizes, he added, with so many legal entities delegating technological responsibilities to external IT service provides or hosting in-house teams to deal with such concerns.\n\n\u201cBut, unfortunately, where law firms \u2013 and frankly other businesses as well \u2013 probably let themselves down, is that you might be able to outsource the care, but you can\u2019t outsource the responsibility. And that\u2019s the gap where this goes wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nProfessional services firms across Australia, but particularly law firms, \u201chave been caught out a little bit\u201d, Mr Corbett-Wilkins mused.\n\n\u201cAs lawyers, we ultimately owe it to ourselves, but also to our clients, to really educate ourselves around this and also educate our clients around this risk. It\u2019s an ever-evolving risk,\u201d he concluded.\n\n\u201cThis is a risk that is going to continue to exist throughout our entire lifetimes of doing work, so it\u2019s really something we just need to take a handle on now.\u201d\n\nTo listen to the full conversation with Reece Corbett-Wilkins, click below:\n\nLaw firms cannot ignore risk of privacy class actions from their own clients Jerome Doraisamy Last Updated: 10 October 2019 Published: 11 October 2019"}}
