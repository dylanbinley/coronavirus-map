Smith\u2019s attorney, David Draper, and Grosse Pointe Woods Department of Public Safety Detective Ryan Schroerlucke attended the arraignment. Due to social distancing, the media was encouraged to view the court hearing via Zoom video conferencing.\n\nIn court, Draper \u2014 while asking for personal bond \u2014 said that Smith has been \u201ccooperative, is employed full time and has no criminal record.\u201d Smith also \u201cimmediately retained counsel,\u201d Draper said.\n\nDraper told the judge that Smith\u2019s wife is a teacher at Monteith and that his two children either attend the school or attended in the past. The defendant also has \u201cmany strong, strong ties to the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cDetective Schroerlucke and myself have been working together very cooperatively to share documents,\u201d Draper said. \u201cIn fact, today I received a number of financial documents we need to go over as this case progresses.\u201d\n\nWhen Metry asked Smith what he does for a living, he said he works for a logistics company.\n\n\u201cThey are aware of the situation, and he is still employed,\u201d Draper said.\n\nAccording to Worthy\u2019s press release, Smith was the treasurer of the GPPSS Millage Committee for Renewal between October 2019 and January 2020. An audit of the organization\u2019s finances \u201crevealed the occurrence of unauthorized activity on the account.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 27 of this year, a report was filed with the Grosse Pointe Woods Department of Public Safety alleging the defendant had accessed the Renew GPPSS account without authorization and embezzled over $1,000 in funds over three months. He was charged with embezzlement in an amount of at least $1,000 and less than $20,000.\n\nAccording to Worthy, Smith was the treasurer of the Monteith PTO between July 2017 and January 2020, and an audit of the organization\u2019s finances revealed the occurrence of unauthorized activity on the account. On Feb. 12, 2020, a report on the matter was filed with the Grosse Pointe Woods Department of Public Safety.\n\nIt was alleged that Smith accessed the PTO account without authorization and embezzled more than $91,000 in funds over two and a half years. In that case, Smith has been charged with embezzlement of at least $50,000 and less than $100,000.\n\nBond was set at $25,000, 10 percent, in the Monteith PTO case, and $5,000, 10 percent, in the GPPSS Millage Committee for Renewal case. Smith posted bond.\n\nAs per Metry, Smith is not to have any contact with any witnesses in the cases and is not to handle any finances or funding for any organizations.
