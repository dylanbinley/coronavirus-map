While some details remain to be hashed out, the move essentially designates the northern region \u2014 one of the world\u2019s most poor and violent areas \u2014 as a potential safe haven for refugees.\n\nAt a U.N. meeting with President Donald Trump and President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, McAleenan touted the \u201ctremendous partnership\u201d between the two countries.\n\n\u201cI really see the advances that you\u2019re making on ending forced migration as very productive for the region and we\u2019ll be there alongside supporting you,\u201d McAleenan said.\n\nEl Salvador joined in a similar agreement with McAleenan last week. Officials at U.S. Homeland Security continue to negotiate details with various Central American counterparts.\n\nThe insistence that Northern Triangle countries could accept migrants fleeing crime and violence has prompted swift backlash from human rights and immigration advocacy groups.\n\nThe region has some of the highest homicide rates in Latin America. El Salvador struggles with high unemployment and low wages, according to the U.S. government\u2019s own data.\n\nA study by Doctors Without Borders on why people are fleeing the Northern Triangle cited El Salvador as having the highest murder rate in the world in 2015, and said 150,000 people had been killed in the three Northern Triangle countries in the last decade.\n\nThe State Department consistently warns Americans against traveling to the region. The crime and economic instability in the Northern Triangle is considered a major reason why Central Americans account for a significant number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cWhere will they declare a haven for asylum seekers next? Syria? North Korea? This is cynical and absurd,\u201d said Eric Schwartz, president of Refugees International.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Foulon, the regional head of Doctors Without Borders, said the international medical aid organization is barely able to handle the number of deportees already sent back to El Salvador.\n\n\u201cThese deals are only going to create more suffering for people who have fled violence in their home countries, and who suffer further along the migration route in Mexico,\u201d Foulon said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThey will now most likely will suffer even more in El Salvador.\u201d\n\nFor the U.S., the accord is part of an elaborate patchwork of rules and regulations aimed at preventing another surge of migration this fall. The number of undocumented migrants stopped at the U.S.-Mexico border this budget year is expected to fall just shy of one million, according to Customs and Border Protection \u2014 more than the first two years of Trump\u2019s time in office combined.\n\n\u201c[The Salvadorans] have a developing asylum capacity,\u201d McAleenan said last week. \u201cWe seek to support that and recognize it,\u201d\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill called their agreement with the U.S. a \u201cwin-win\u201d situation and described it as a level of help that \u201chad not been done in 15 years.\u201d She also said the new government there is serious about solving the countries\u2019 problems.\n\n\u201cWe need to reconstruct and rebuild our relationships with the United States,\u201d Hill said.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019, ABC Radio.
