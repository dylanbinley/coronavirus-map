Korean official", "TEXT": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 The top U.S. official on North Korea accused a senior North Korean nuclear negotiator on Wednesday of being \u201clocked in an old way of thinking,\u201d days after the negotiator said Pyongyang won\u2019t resume talks with Washington because of its \u201chostile\u201d policies.\n\nThe comments by Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun were a rare case of a senior U.S. official directly criticizing North Korea since the two countries launched now-stalled diplomacy on North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal in 2018. The comments suggest that Washington may not be interested in resuming the diplomacy anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen some recent press reporting that the North Koreans are not prepared to meet with me on this visit,\u201d Biegun told reporters after talks with South Korean officials. \u201cWe did not request a meeting with the North Koreans. This visit is to meet with our close friends and allies, the Republic of Korea, and we had an excellent discussion.\u201d\n\nBiegun was likely referring to recent North Korean state media reports that cited Vice Foreign Minister Choe Sun Hui as saying Pyongyang won\u2019t resume the diplomacy unless Washington discards what she described as \u201chostile\u201d policies. Choe, who has been deeply involved in the nuclear talks, also slammed the U.S. for its \u201cshallow tactic\u201d to use North Korea for domestic political gains.\n\n\u201cI also want to be very clear on one point. I do not take my direction from (Choe), nor from Ambassador John Bolton,\u201d Biegun said.\n\nAlong with Choe, Biegun was referring to President Donald Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, who in his recently released memoir accused him of pursuing an \u201cunhealthy negotiation path\u201d by demonstrating a willingness to negotiate a step-by-step deal advocated by North Korea.\n\n\u201cBoth are locked in an old way of thinking, focused on only the negatives and what is impossible, rather than thinking creatively about what is possible,\u201d Biegun said in a written statement published later Wednesday. That comment wasn\u2019t included in his earlier verbal remarks to reporters, which were almost identical to the written statement.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear why Biegun\u2019s verbal remarks did not include that comment. South Korean media speculated that Biegun may have been trying not to provoke North Korea too much, though he could have simply accidentally missed those parts.\n\nIn both his verbal and written remarks, Biegun, who has previously described Choe as his potential counterpart when talks resume, said the U.S. would be ready for talks with North Korea when his dialogue interlocutor is named, in his apparent disapproval of Choe as his counterpart.\n\n\u201cWhen Chairman Kim appoints a counterpart to me who is prepared and empowered to negotiate on these issues, they will find us ready at that very moment,\u201d Biegun said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s state news agency on Wednesday didn\u2019t issue any fresh statements on the United States. Earlier in the day, it reported that Kim had visited a mausoleum in Pyongyang to pay tribute to his late grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung on the 26th anniversary of his death.\n\nTrump and Kim have met three times since 2018, but the nuclear negotiations have fallen apart since their second summit in February last year in Vietnam. North Korea has repeatedly said in recent months that it would no longer give Trump the gift of high-profile meetings he could boast of as foreign policy achievements unless it gets something substantial in return.\n\nNorth Korea recently dialed up pressure on South Korea by cutting off virtually all cooperation and blowing up an inter-Korean liaison office in its territory last month. That followed months of frustration over Seoul\u2019s unwillingness to defy U.S.-led sanctions and restart joint economic projects that would help the North\u2019s broken economy.\n\nSome analysts believe North Korea will also avoid serious talks with the Americans for now and instead focus on pressuring the South in a bid to increase its bargaining power before an eventual return to negotiations after the U.S. presidential election in November. They say North Korea likely doesn\u2019t want to make any major commitments or concessions when there is a chance that U.S. leadership could change.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Associated Press.
