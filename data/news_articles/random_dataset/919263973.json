Penalties await those who break the rules.\n\nHospitals also told TODAY that anecdotally, they have seen a rise in postnatal anxiety and it is generally more challenging for new mothers now to cope with the demands of raising a newborn.\n\nWhile Chen was able to secure a confinement nanny in time for her birth, she is now concerned about how she will manage caregiving duties when she has to resume work after her maternity leave is over three months from now. She and her husband are working from home now but she is unsure if she may have to go back to office by then.\n\n\u201cBeing a new mum is already quite stressful This Covid-19 situation adds more stress to that,\u201d she said.\n\nLearning to be more independent\n\nSome of these parents interviewed by TODAY recounted similar experiences as Chen\u2019s, while others said that their caregiving arrangements have been disrupted now that they cannot meet family members who do not live with them.\n\nUnder the rules, parents are no longer allowed to drop off their children at their grandparents\u2019 home on a daily basis and grandparents are no longer allowed to visit daily for caregiving purposes.\n\nGrandparents can only continue to do so if their grandchildren stay with them throughout the period of the circuit breaker to restrict movement of people from April 7 to May 4.\n\nOne 29-year-old mother who did not want to be identified was learning to become more independent now that her confinement period is over, but the lack of familial support has been challenging since she cares for her newborn alone while her husband goes out to work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy. There\u2019s plenty of things to learn and it\u2019s just hard to manage a very young infant without help from my own family members.\u201d\n\nThe biggest hurdle so far has been the lack of emotional support.\n\n\u201cFamily support is what I miss the most. Yes, there is technology, but it is still different from having people at home with you. It feels like my confinement has been extended from January,\u201d she added.\n\nAnother parent, who gave her name as just Lim, 30, wanted her mother to drop by daily to help with her newborn child while her domestic worker cared for her two-year-old.\n\nNow, she is one man down and she finds it difficult to steal time to rest during her confinement.\n\nLast-minute calls\n\nSimilar to what Chen experienced, frustrations abound for mothers when confinement nannies and hired help cancel at the last minute because of travel restrictions overseas.\n\nIn response to TODAY\u2019s queries, Pem Confinement Nanny Agency said that it has received an influx of calls from clients asking whether their nanny is still able to join them for their confinement.\n\nThe agency also received many last-minute enquiries to book nannies because a number of mothers had freelance nannies or nannies hired from another agency who were unable to enter Singapore after Malaysia\u2019s lockdown.\n\nTrips to see doctors\n\nNew restrictions at clinics and hospitals \u2014 where only one parent can accompany the child for appointments \u2014 have left new mothers fumbling as they learn the ropes on how to handle their infant\u2019s needs.\n\nA 24-year-old mother who declined to be named said, for example, on trips to the clinic, she has had to push the pram, carry the diaper bag and baby, and soothe the child when he cried.\n\n\u201cBut I have no choice because he has to get his vaccinations and regular check-ups.\u201d\n\nBreastfeeding problems\n\nSeparately, a spokesperson for the Breastfeeding Mothers\u2019 Support Group, a non-governmental organisation that provides counselling services and workshops for mothers, said that it has seen an increase in requests from mothers who cannot access urgent lactation-related consultations, despite having a serious breastfeeding issue.\n\nThe group gets about 100 enquiries a month over messaging platform WhatsApp and while that has not changed, there are more people asking for help on lactation and related needs than before.\n\n\u201cIt appears that some hospital lactation support departments have been marked as a non-essential service.\n\n\u201cMothers have reported that they have been rejected by hospitals or were unable to set up appointments due to the circuit breaker measures,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nHospitals continue to offer support\n\nIn response to TODAY\u2019s queries, Dr Cornelia Chee, head and senior consultant of the department of psychological medicine at the National University Hospital (NUH), said that anecdotally, the hospital has seen an increase in postnatal anxiety rather than postnatal depression.\n\nSimilarly, Associate Professor Helen Chen, head and senior consultant of the department of psychological medicine at KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital (KKH), said that even though they cannot provide statistics, the hospital has observed that the circuit breaker period has been \u201cparticularly challenging\u201d for new mothers.\n\n\u201cIt is not unanticipated though, since these new mothers\u2019 movements would be restricted and they would have to cope with the demands of a newborn baby and other responsibilities at home,\u201d she said.\n\nTo help new mothers during this period, Assoc Prof Chen said that the clinical team at KKH has been actively contacting its patients who are just about to deliver or have just given birth, particularly those who have little family support or postpartum assistance.\n\nKKH has also been building up its capacity to provide video consultations for mothers who need more psychological or psychiatric help but are apprehensive about visiting the hospital this period.\n\nDr Yang Liying, a consultant at Singapore General Hospital\u2019s department of obstetrics and gynaecology, said that the hospital calls all its postnatal patients shortly after discharge to check on their recovery process and find out how they are coping.\n\n\u201cFeedback from the nurses suggests that the mothers are mostly coping well and are instead asking the nurses about their wellbeing and telling them to be safe,\u201d Dr Yang said.\n\nOver at NUH, Assoc Prof Su Lin Lin, head and senior consultant at NUH\u2019s division of maternal-fetal medicine, said that the staff nurses at the ward continue to call its postnatal patients 24 hours after they have been discharged.\n\n\u201cIf necessary, we do further follow-up calls to check on the wellbeing of our mothers and babies,\u201d she added.\n\nNUH also encourages its patients who need breastfeeding support to consult its lactation consultations through teleconsultations.\n\n\u201cWe strive to provide as much support as possible to our new parents in the ward and equip them with the necessary knowledge and skills before discharge, so that they feel more confident coping at home following discharge.\u201d \u2014 TODAY"}}
