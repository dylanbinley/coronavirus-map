Taxis may begin at 0600 in Loma Linda and drive East on Route 39 to La Casa Presidencial in Zapote. ANEP Uni\u00f3n members may begin at 0900 and March from Central Park in San Jos\u00e9 to Congress. Expect ancillary protests and/or disruptions to traffic patterns in these and other areas.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy recommends that tourists and residents \u201cexercise caution in these areas.\u201d The protests are expected to be non-violent.\n\nTaxi drivers and ANEP (the National Association of Public and Private Employees) said they will join the High School Teachers Association (APSE) and the National Association of Educators (ANDE) in striking for the continued right to strike.\n\nThe president of ANDE, Gilberto Cascante, is among those criticizing proposed law 21.049, which would regulate the right to strike. The union leader says the law seeks to take away rights from workers.\n\nMeanwhile, proponents of the bill, including the Costa Rican Chamber of Industries (CICR), say it would help preserve essential services that are imperative for Costa Rican society and foreign investment."}}
