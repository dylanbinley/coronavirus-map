The US will offer the draft resolution of extending arms embargo in a UNSC session on Tuesday.\n\nChina and Russia have clearly announced that they will veto such a resolution, however, Foreign Policy has reported that Washington may even fail to attract the required 9 votes to pass the resolution in the first place, Mehr news agency reported.\n\nSource: Iranian media"}}
