It also provoked the first public response from Lauer, who said in a defiant and graphic letter made public by his lawyer that \u201cmy silence was a mistake.\u201d\n\nVariety first reported Nevils\u2019 charges after obtaining a copy of Farrow\u2019s book. The Associated Press typically does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault, unless they step forward publicly as Nevils has done.\n\nNevils, who was working for Meredith Vieira in Sochi, met her for drinks one night and Lauer joined them. Nevils said she had six shots of vodka and wound up going to Lauer\u2019s room.\n\nShe said that Lauer pushed her onto a bed and asked if she liked anal sex. Nevils said she declined several times, but then Lauer \u201cjust did it.\u201d She described the encounter as \u201cexcruciatingly painful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,\u201d Nevils told Farrow, according to Variety. \u201cIt was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\u201d\n\nIn his letter, Lauer admitted to his extramarital affair with Nevils. He said on that night in Sochi that they consensually performed a variety of sexual acts.\n\n\u201cShe was a fully enthusiastic and willing partner,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt no time did she behave in a way that made it appear she was incapable of consent. She seemed to know exactly what she wanted to do.\u201d\n\nLauer\u2019s defense of his behavior extends beyond his relationship with Nevils. He said he has \u201cnever assaulted anyone or forced anyone to have sex. Period.\u201d\n\nHe also acknowledges other extramarital encounters, and criticized the women involved for having \u201cabandoned shared responsibility\u201d for the affairs to shield themselves from blame behind false allegations.\n\n\u201cThey have avoided having to look at a boyfriend, a husband or a child in the eye and say, \u2018I cheated,'\u201d Lauer said. \u201cAnd I will no longer provide them the shelter of my silence.\u201d\n\nLauer said the night in Sochi was the first of several sexual encounters he had with Nevils over several months, including one in his dressing room at NBC, which \u201cshowed terrible judgment on my part.\u201d\n\nNevils\u2019 lawyer did not immediately return a message for comment on Lauer\u2019s letter Wednesday.\n\nEleanor McManus, who co-founded the group Press Forward to support victims of sexual abuse in the news industry, said Lauer\u2019s letter was \u201cunbelievable.\n\n\u201cLauer\u2019s statement demonstrates not only his lack of remorse, but his lack of understanding of sexual harassment and the #MeToo movement,\u201d said McManus, who said she was harassed by journalist Mark Halperin (who lost jobs at NBC and elsewhere because of these and other accusations). \u201cNowhere in his letter does Lauer acknowledge the power he yielded as a celebrity and the star of NBC\u2019s highest-rated show. The two people in that hotel room in Sochi did not have equal power.\u201d\n\nFarrow\u2019s publisher, Little, Brown & Co., said that the book has been fact-checked and incorporates the responses of individuals and institutions that were included. When it is published, \u201creaders will understand the full context and impact of Farrow\u2019s work, and the bravery of the sources who entrusted him with their stories.\u201d\n\nNBC News Chairman Andrew Lack sent a memo to his staff on Wednesday, saying that any suggestion that NBC knew of Lauer\u2019s conduct prior to the night before he was fired for \u201cinappropriate sexual conduct\u201d was wrong. There were no claims or allegations of improper conduct by Lauer prior to that, he said, although settlements were reached with two women regarding Lauer after he was fired.\n\n\u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time,\u201d NBC News said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague.\u201d\n\nNevils\u2019 story was reported Wednesday on the show Lauer hosted for two decades. His former co-host, Savannah Guthrie, called it shocking and appalling.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disturbed to our core,\u201d Guthrie said.\n\nLauer said in his letter that he ended the affair poorly and understands how that must have made Nevils feel.\n\nHe said that he hadn\u2019t responded publicly before to allegations in order to spare his family pain, but that now he has their support to address them publicly.\n\n\u201cAnyone who knows me will tell you I am a very private person,\u201d Lauer wrote. \u201cI had no desire to write this, but I had no choice.\u201d\n\nCredit : Associated Press (AP) | Photo Credit : (AP)\n\nLike this: Like Loading..."}}
