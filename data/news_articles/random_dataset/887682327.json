Greer was accused in May 2016 of repeatedly sexually assaulting Mirlis, of New Jersey, over several years in the early- to mid-2000s. Mirlis attended the school from 2001 to 2005.

Mirlis has allowed his name to be used.\n\nThe state originally also charged Greer with four counts of second-degree sexual assault. But in a surprise motion made after the state and defense rested their cases in September, Dow asked Superior Court Judge Jon M. Alander to dismiss those counts because Dow had found a clause in state law requiring a complainant in such cases to notify authorities within five years. Mirlis had waited until 2016 to go to New Haven police.\n\nAsked for comment on the subpoena and the new motion by the defense, Dressler said in an email: \u201cThe subpoena is nothing short of a dangerous attempt to silence my First Amendment rights as a member of the free press. This is America, not China. Mr. Greer\u2019s attorneys, as prominent members of the Connecticut bar, should be ashamed of themselves for supporting Greer in his antics. I will be looking into suing Mr. Greer and his attorneys for vexatious suit and abuse of process.\u201d\n\nSenior Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Maxine Wilensky, one of the two prosecutors in the Greer case, said she had no comment on the defense motion.\n\nThe witnesses cited in the motion were described as \u201cthe only defense fact witnesses.\u201d\n\nLedbury testified she has been Greer\u2019s secretary for the past 22 years. She said she never saw Mirlis with Greer outside the school classrooms. Mirlis testified he had been in Greer\u2019s office on many occasions.\n\nDeRosa, who taught at Yeshiva New Haven and had Mirlis as one of his students, testified Mirlis was \u201cuncooperative\u201d in the classroom as well as \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cacting out a great deal.\u201d\n\nAccording to the defense motion, \u201cduring the course of the trial Mr. Dressler contacted the two defense fact witnesses in ways both found to be alarming and intimidating.\u201d\n\nThe motion reported that while Ledbury was in the courthouse waiting to testify, \u201cDressler made a comment to her that, while seemingly innocuous on its face, she took as an attempt to intimidate her or persuade her not to testify.\u201d The writ did not quote what Dressler said to her.\n\nBut the motion added that at the beginning of the trial Dressler and a reporter (not from the New Haven Register) \u201cblocked her car outside the courthouse while the reporter took photos.\u201d\n\nThe next day Dressler allegedly told Ledbury: \u201cI hope you know either way you\u2019re out of a job.\u201d The motion said she interpreted this \u201cas a threat that Dressler or someone else would take steps to endanger her livelihood, even if Daniel Greer were found not guilty.\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Ledbury indicates she believes at least one part of her testimony was affected negatively by the Dressler contacts and resulting anxiety,\u201d the motion said.\n\nIn addition, the motion described an encouter Dressler allegedly initiated on the weekend before DeRosa testified. \u201cDeRosa was outside on the front lawn of his wooded, secluded home in Southbury, and was unexpectedly approached by an individual he later learned was Lawrence Dressler. Dressler commented he was a \u2018hard guy to find\u2019 and started what Dr. DeRosa described as a tirade against Greer, talking about bad things he supposedly had done. DeRosa understood this to be an effort to try to convince him not to testify on Greer\u2019s behalf.\u201d\n\nAccording to the motion, the encounter \u201cwas particularly upsetting to Dr. DeRosa because he suffers from a spinal disability and was outside without the brace and/or cane he normally uses for physical support. He felt vulnerable and fearful because he was unable to defend himself. He remained anxious about the encounter even after Mr. Dressler left his property.\u201d\n\nThe motion said DeRosa had trouble sleeping the night before he testified. The motion quoted him saying \u201cmy court appearance and testimony were affected by Mr. Dressler\u2019s visit to my home.\u201d\n\nThe defense attorneys wrote that Dressler\u2019s conduct shortly before the witnesses testified \u201cwould be disturbing if undertaken by a private citizen. Dressler has admitted, however, to being a member of the state team prosecuting this case. Such witness interference by an agent of the state amounts to prosecutorial misconduct and a deprivation of the constitutional right to a fair trial.\u201d\n\nThe defense attorneys added: \u201cWe have no evidence the state specifically sanctioned or was aware of Dressler\u2019s contacts with defense witnesses. However, that does not mean the state is not bound by his conduct, if he was acting as an agent of the state at the time.\u201d\n\nThe motion quoted Dressler saying he was surprised the state \u201casked a criminal like myself to assist\u201d in the case against Greer. Dressler has said he received a 20-month prison sentence \u201cfor my involvement as a closing attorney in a mortgage fraud conspiracy.\u201d It was not immediately clear what Dressler\u2019s official role, if any, was in the case.\n\nThe defense attorneys also wrote: \u201cMr. Dressler has been open and honest in often vicious postings about his desire to see Daniel Greer and the Yeshiva of New Haven ruined, and Greer arrested and incarcerated.\u201d\n\nThe attorneys implied Dressler might have tampered with the witnesses. They said his approaches to the witnesses \u201cwere at best troubling and at worst much more sinister and potentially unlawful.\u201d\n\nrandall.beach@hearstmediact.com"}}
