Kennedy wrote to then-Premier of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis in the 1960s.\n\nThe former Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s parody letter opened with: \u201cDear Premier Khrushchev, don\u2019t be a dick, OK? Get your missiles out of Cuba.\u201d\n\nEverybody will say, \u2018yay! Khrushchev! You\u2019re the best! But if you don\u2019t, everybody will be like \u2018what an asshole\u2019 and call your garbage country \u2018The Soviet Bunion,\u2019\u201d it goes on to read. \u201cYou\u2019re really busting my nuts here.\u201d\n\nThe date for the parody letter \u2013 Oct. 16, 1962 \u2013 makes it appear to have been written on the day that missiles capable of reaching U.S. soil were discovered in Cuba.\n\nClinton's letter is almost a direct copy of one shown during a monologue earlier this week by late night host Jimmy Kimmel -- but with one difference. While Kimmel's version was censored, Clinton's is not.\n\nThe strange way the parody letter was written was clearly no coincidence, as it echoes the tone of the widely-panned letter Trump sent to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over his decision to invade Syria earlier this month. When the Oct. 9 letter was made public, Trump's unconventional approach to diplomacy was evident throughout.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s letter, the president told Turkey\u2019s leader, \u201cdon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d\n\nHe also added \"don't let the world down\u201d before mentioning that the Kurds were willing to negotiate and \"make concessions that they never would have made in the past.\"\n\nThe effectiveness of Trump\u2019s letter is arguably in question as \u201cTurkish presidential sources\u201d told the BBC that Erdogan received the letter and \u201cthoroughly rejected it and put it in the bin.\u201d\n\nAt the time of publication, Trump had not responded to the parody letter."}}
