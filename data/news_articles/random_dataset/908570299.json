Bernie Sanders and the Demo\u00adc\u00adra\u00adt\u00adic Par\u00adty elite took cen\u00adter stage at the Feb\u00adru\u00adary 25 demo\u00adc\u00adra\u00adt\u00adic debate in South Car\u00adoli\u00adna, host\u00aded by CBS News and the Con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal Black Cau\u00adcus Insti\u00adtute. Every oth\u00ader can\u00addi\u00addate on stage had a key goal: to prove that Bernie Sanders is too divi\u00adsive, too left-wing, and not savvy enough to unite the coun\u00adtry against Don\u00adald Trump. They were abet\u00adted by mod\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtors who came ready to fire one red-bait\u00ading ques\u00adtion after the next.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what the Democratic establishment seems to be hoping for: to resuscitate the boogeyman of communism and red-baiting, and to use that to take down Sanders.\n\nThe first debate ques\u00adtion \u2014 \u200b\u201cHow will you con\u00advince vot\u00aders that a Demo\u00adc\u00adra\u00adt\u00adic social\u00adist can do bet\u00adter than Pres\u00adi\u00addent Trump with the econ\u00ado\u00admy?\u201d \u2014 shows just how out of touch the CBS mod\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtors are with the aver\u00adage work\u00ader in this coun\u00adtry. The offi\u00adcial unem\u00adploy\u00adment rate may be rel\u00ada\u00adtive\u00adly low, but wages for work\u00aders are near\u00adly stag\u00adnant, more than half a mil\u00adlion peo\u00adple are home\u00adless, and mil\u00adlions are unin\u00adsured or under\u00adin\u00adsured. Mean\u00adwhile, the for\u00adtunes of the super-rich are grow\u00ading rapid\u00adly and dra\u00admat\u00adi\u00adcal\u00adly, and each day we hear about the new hun\u00addred-mil\u00adlion-dol\u00adlar home Jeff Bezos bought, or the elec\u00adtric Porsche that Bill Gates is the new own\u00ader of. Yet the impli\u00adca\u00adtion of this debate ques\u00adtion is that this sys\u00adtem is work\u00ading, and that being a Demo\u00adc\u00adra\u00adt\u00adic Social\u00adist is a lia\u00adbil\u00adi\u00adty, some\u00adthing CBS has no evi\u00addence of \u2014 and that Sanders firm\u00adly reject\u00aded. \u200b\u201cWe\u2019re going to cre\u00adate an econ\u00ado\u00admy for all,\u201d Sanders said in response, \u200b\u201cnot just wealthy cam\u00adpaign contributors.\u201d\n\nThrough\u00adout the night, many can\u00addi\u00addates tried as best they could to cart out and weaponize \u200b\u201cdemo\u00adc\u00adra\u00adt\u00adic social\u00adism\u201d as an attack against the nation\u00adal front-run\u00adner. Sen. Amy Klobuchar repeat\u00aded a posi\u00adtion she\u2019s expressed before. \u200b\u201cI am the only one in the New Hamp\u00adshire debate, when asked, if we had a prob\u00adlem with a social\u00adist lead\u00ading the tick\u00adet, that raised my hand,\u201d she said. Tom Stey\u00ader said, \u200b\u201cWe are look\u00ading at a par\u00adty that has decid\u00aded that we\u2019re either going to sup\u00adport some\u00adone who is a demo\u00adc\u00adra\u00adt\u00adic social\u00adist or some\u00adbody who has a long his\u00adto\u00adry of being a Repub\u00adli\u00adcan.\u201d Yet polling shows some of Sanders\u2019 pro\u00adgrams are over\u00adwhelm\u00ading\u00adly pop\u00adu\u00adlar: 70% of Amer\u00adi\u00adcans sup\u00adport Medicare for All, accord\u00ading to an Amer\u00adi\u00adcan Barom\u00ade\u00adter sur\u00advey from 2018.\n\nSome of the can\u00addi\u00addates made remarks that were red-bait\u00ading by impli\u00adca\u00adtion. May\u00ador Pete Buttigieg said, \u200b\u201cI am not look\u00ading for\u00adward to a sce\u00adnario where it comes down to Don\u00adald Trump, with his nos\u00adtal\u00adgia for the social order of the 1950s, and Bernie Sanders with a nos\u00adtal\u00adgia for the rev\u00ado\u00adlu\u00adtion\u00adary pol\u00adi\u00adtics of the 1960s.\u201d The \u200b\u201crev\u00ado\u00adlu\u00adtion\u00adary pol\u00adi\u00adtics of the 1960s\u201d that Buttigieg dis\u00admissed are what brought us the Civ\u00adil Rights move\u00adment, which Sanders was an active par\u00adtic\u00adi\u00adpant in, hav\u00ading been arrest\u00aded in 1963 protest\u00ading racial seg\u00adre\u00adga\u00adtion in Chica\u00adgo schools.\n\nPer\u00adhaps the most stun\u00adning moment of the evening came from Face the Nation\u200b\u2019s Mar\u00adgaret Bren\u00adnan, who said, \u200b\u201cYou\u2019ve praised the Chi\u00adnese Com\u00admu\u00adnist Par\u00adty for lift\u00ading more peo\u00adple out of extreme pover\u00adty than any oth\u00ader coun\u00adtry. You also have a track record of express\u00ading sym\u00adpa\u00adthy for social\u00adist gov\u00adern\u00adments in Cuba and in Nicaragua. Can Amer\u00adi\u00adcans trust that a demo\u00adc\u00adra\u00adt\u00adic social\u00adist pres\u00adi\u00addent will not give author\u00adi\u00adtar\u00adi\u00adans a free pass?\u201d There was, of course, no ques\u00adtion of what would be done to change the track record of sor\u00addid U.S. inter\u00adven\u00adtions abroad, includ\u00ading in Nicaragua where the U.S. armed and fund\u00aded the Con\u00adtras and their bru\u00adtal cam\u00adpaign against the Sandinistas.\n\nBloomberg said, \u200b\u201cVladimir Putin thinks that Don\u00adald Trump should be pres\u00adi\u00addent of the Unit\u00aded States. And that\u2019s why Rus\u00adsia is help\u00ading you get elect\u00aded, so you will lose to him.\u201d Sanders was, once again, forced to explain his non-rela\u00adtion\u00adship to Vladimir Putin. The irony of this ques\u00adtion posed by Bloomberg isn\u2019t lost on work\u00ading peo\u00adple, who have been bom\u00adbard\u00aded by his over\u00adwhelm\u00ading media pres\u00adence thanks to the unprece\u00addent\u00aded amount of his per\u00adson\u00adal for\u00adtune he\u2019s spent buy\u00ading his way into the elec\u00adtion process. Yet, instead of focus\u00ading on Bloomberg\u2019s unprece\u00addent\u00aded spend\u00ading, it almost felt like there was a revival of the Cold War on stage.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what the Demo\u00adc\u00adra\u00adt\u00adic estab\u00adlish\u00adment seems to be hop\u00ading for: to resus\u00adci\u00adtate the boogey\u00adman of com\u00admu\u00adnism and red-bait\u00ading, and to use that to take down Sanders. But the truth is that Sanders\u2019 pro\u00adgram is wild\u00adly pop\u00adu\u00adlar, and that Sanders has remained com\u00admit\u00adted to it, even through\u00adout the attacks he weath\u00adered on both the debate stage and through\u00adout his cam\u00adpaign. His mes\u00adsag\u00ading has stayed con\u00adsis\u00adtent \u2014 he almost nev\u00ader wavers from it, even when it sets him\u00adself apart from the oth\u00ader candidates.\n\nThis is most clear on ques\u00adtions about for\u00adeign pol\u00adi\u00adcy. From the debate stage, Sanders acknowl\u00adedged the bru\u00adtal his\u00adto\u00adry of U.S. inter\u00adven\u00adtions. \u200b\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, \u200b\u201cocca\u00adsion\u00adal\u00adly it might be a good idea to be hon\u00adest about Amer\u00adi\u00adcan for\u00adeign pol\u00adi\u00adcy, and that includes the fact that Amer\u00adi\u00adca has over\u00adthrown gov\u00adern\u00adments all over the world in Chile, in Guatemala, in Iran.\u201d He also called Israeli Prime Min\u00adis\u00adter Ben\u00adjamin Netanyahu a \u200b\u201creac\u00adtionary racist,\u201d while acknowl\u00adedg\u00ading \u200b\u201cyou can\u00adnot ignore the suf\u00adfer\u00ading of the Pales\u00adtin\u00adian peo\u00adple.\u201d These are rel\u00ada\u00adtive\u00adly remark\u00adable admis\u00adsions from any major par\u00adty pres\u00adi\u00adden\u00adtial candidate.\n\nThe only depar\u00adture from the sus\u00adtained attacks against Sanders through\u00adout the night came from Eliz\u00ada\u00adbeth War\u00adren, as she con\u00adtin\u00adued to focus relent\u00adless pres\u00adsure on Michael Bloomberg \u2014 from his defense of the racist prac\u00adtice of redlin\u00ading, to his use and refusal to blan\u00adket\u00adly release for\u00admer women employ\u00adees\u2019 from non-dis\u00adclo\u00adsure agree\u00adments he had forced them to sign. The atten\u00adtion on Bloomberg took the heat off Sanders a lit\u00adtle, but not much: He was still the main punch\u00ading bag of the night.\n\nSen. Eliz\u00ada\u00adbeth War\u00adren did, how\u00adev\u00ader, join in some of the crit\u00adi\u00adcisms of Sanders, agree\u00ading that \u200b\u201cpro\u00adgres\u00adsive ideas are pop\u00adu\u00adlar ideas,\u201d but that only she would be effec\u00adtive at actu\u00adal\u00adly get\u00adting it done.\n\nYou\u2019d think that Sanders was unpop\u00adu\u00adlar based on the stu\u00addio audience\u2019s response to him, which includ\u00aded moments of silence in response to his most pop\u00adu\u00adlar cam\u00adpaign planks, and even occa\u00adsion\u00adal boo\u00ading. That\u2019s because tick\u00adets cost any\u00adwhere from $1,750 to $3,200, accord\u00ading to reports. Any\u00adone with that kind of cash to spare on the tele\u00advised train wreck we all watched is prob\u00ada\u00adbly not one of the 40% of Amer\u00adi\u00adcans with less than $400 in sav\u00adings. After all, every\u00adthing has a class character.\n\nBut red-bait\u00ading and the rich won\u2019t stop Bernie. It should go with\u00adout say\u00ading, and yet we have to keep repeat\u00ading it because it\u2019s con\u00adsis\u00adtent\u00adly ignored or down-played: Bernie Sanders is the nation\u00adal front-run\u00adner in the Demo\u00adc\u00adra\u00adt\u00adic Pri\u00adma\u00adry, and has won the first three states \u2014 some\u00adthing no oth\u00ader can\u00addi\u00addate has ever done before. He is poised to either win or come in a very close sec\u00adond in South Car\u00adoli\u00adna, and is lead\u00ading the polls in Cal\u00adi\u00adfor\u00adnia and Texas. The can\u00addi\u00addates and mod\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtors are out of touch with the vast major\u00adi\u00adty of vot\u00aders in this coun\u00adtry, who agree that Sanders\u2019 plat\u00adform isn\u2019t rad\u00adi\u00adcal, but just and deserved. These vot\u00aders are not only plan\u00adning to vote for him in their pri\u00adma\u00adry elec\u00adtions, but are also donat\u00ading, vol\u00adun\u00adteer\u00ading and orga\u00adniz\u00ading for him in record num\u00adbers. In spite of the attacks Sanders weath\u00adered on Tues\u00adday night, there is no sign that the momen\u00adtum and enthu\u00adsi\u00adasm ener\u00adgiz\u00ading his cam\u00adpaign and the grass\u00adroots move\u00adment around it is going any\u00adwhere but up."}}
