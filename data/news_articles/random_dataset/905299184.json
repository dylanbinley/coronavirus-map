They are similar to those indigenous Americans, who, dazzled by the colorful mirrors offered by the Spanish conquerors, gave away their gold and silver in exchange for those trinkets.\n\nNow, it is true that Pepe is a \u201cstage artist\u201d and can tell every audience what they want to hear. He knows how to sugar-coat so that they voluntarily consume toxic ideas without being aware of the truth. However, this ability has an insurmountable limit: the clash with reality.\n\nTherefore, Pepe\u2019s \u201cfans\u201d are those who have not themselves suffered the consequences of his actions, first as a guerrilla and then as a ruler. But those who know the whole story because they have lived it, are outraged by Mujica\u2019s fables and frivolous attitude in the face of painful events.\n\nOne of those people is Jorge Zabalza, another former Tupamaro guerilla. He says, \u201cI am one of the guys who followed Mujica; I am ten years younger than him. But we also pushed, we wanted to. There was a need. It was the spirit of \u201968. That year there had been a lot of events worldwide, the struggle for democracy in Czechoslovakia, Tlatelolco Square, the big demonstrations in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the Black Power, the demonstrations against the war in Vietnam and Woodstock in the United States. All this created an ideological climate. You felt the need for revolution. That there was little reflection; it\u2019s true. The ideal society we wanted had not been discussed much, of course, it was yearning\u2026\u201d\n\nAs a result, Zabalza knows well how things were at that time. He affirms that \u201cMujica is the symbol of the guy who renounced his past, who fantasized about it, transformed it into an epic story, and used it to build the electoral wealth that allows him to be one of the major operators of capitalism in Uruguay today.\u201d\n\nRecently, the \u201cdocumentary\u201d by Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica titled \u201cEl Pepe: a supreme life\u201d was released on Netflix. Subsequently, a journalist asked Zabalza if he was hurt by Mujica\u2019s frivolous reference to the Pando \u201craid.\u201d\n\nThe so-called \u201cToma de Pando\u201d (Pando raid) was an operation carried out by the Tupamaros in October 1969, which involved some forty guerrillas. The result was the death of three Tupamaros (Jorge Salerno, Alfredo Cultelli, and Ricardo, Zabalza\u2019s brother), a policeman (Enrique Fern\u00e1ndez D\u00edaz), and a civilian, Carlos Burgue\u00f1o, who was passing by and was the victim of a shoot-out between the police and the Tupamaros.\n\nBut the version Mujica gives in the documentary is that \u201cthe action ended with some drinking beer, others in prison, and some were wounded, but they recovered. But the most important thing is that after a few days, we were operating out in the streets.\u201d\n\nZabalza responded to these statements by saying, \u201cwhy do you remember having a beer and not remember the deaths? It makes me very angry; I am outraged.\u201d \u201cIt upsets me a lot. It makes me angry because he has no right to refer to himself that way. He made up a new story because the comrades who died were gurises\u201d, he added.\n\nThe journalist notes that the references to Pando are often like an epic as if it had been an adventure, almost celebratory, devoid of all pain. To which Zabalza adds, \u201cAnd then I went and had a beer.\u201d\n\nThis brings us back to another frivolous comment by Mujica when in Venezuela, the brutal Chavista dictatorship was running over peaceful protesters. At that time, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to get in front of the tanks.\u201d\n\nZabalza explains that Mujica built a \u201cstory\u201d about the history of the Tupamaros through the interviews. Others \u201cnever wrote down our experiences. Mujica did it through the media. He is part of the show; he is an actor of the political show.\u201d\n\nAccording to Zabalza, Kusturica \u201cwas in love with Pepe,\u201d and that\u2019s why he portrayed him in the film as \u201ca rock star.\u201d This confirms that the \u201cstory\u201d he tells in his \u201cdocumentary\u201d is closer to fiction than to reality.\n\nOn the other hand, Zabalza exhibits more humanity than Mujica when he recalls the \u201cPando raid.\u201d He expresses his grief for the young comrades who died there. He is also self-critical about what happened to Burgue\u00f1o.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in collateral damage. The blame lies with us there. The narrative at that time was that a police bullet killed Burgue\u00f1o. But there was a crossfire and this is our fault. Whenever something about Pando comes up, I talk about it because Burgue\u00f1o was a man of the people. The responsibility for his death, at least for me, is ours. Or it\u2019s shared with the police. We have to assume our share.\u201d\n\nZabalza also acknowledges that the Tupamaros executed innocent people such as Pascasio B\u00e1ez (a rural laborer), Roque Arteche (a Tupamaro), Juan Bentancor (a factory worker), and Vicente Oroza (a bus driver). Regarding these murders, he admits, \u201cwe did things that make no sense\u201d and recognizes that these deaths \u201care tantamount to crimes against humanity.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Mujica is admired for having created and donated part of his presidential salary to Plan Juntos, an organization dedicated to building houses for the poor. In the style of \u201chumble\u201d Pepe, that program had high public exposure in the mass media, especially on radio and television, nationally and internationally.\n\nHowever, it would seem that there is a lot of talk about that too. Mujica stated that he would provide housing solutions for 15,000 families in extremely precarious conditions. Accordingly, he promised that 4,000 houses would be built during his term in office. However, when he left office, the results were very different. Plan Juntos had carried out only 1008 \u201cinterventions,\u201d which included building some houses but also renovating other homes in precarious situations.\n\nZabalza is critical of the leftist Uruguay governments that promised they would build a lot of housing to meet the needs of the needy population. \u201cBut today, 15 years later, the shortage is the same as it was in 2004. They haven\u2019t done anything. People continue to live in slums (favelas).\u201d In fact, more so than earlier.\n\nThis critical view is corroborated by the World Bank. Recently, a delegation from the international organization visited (along with the elected officials who will take office in March) eleven settlements in the Pantanoso Creek basin. The purpose of their visit was to learn first-hand about the reality of the situation and to help the new government solve this terrible problem because according to the monitoring conducted by the Montevideo City Hall, the Pantanoso has fecal coliform, ammonia, nitrogen, and phosphorus levels well above those permitted by national and international regulations.\n\nAccording to World Bank data, about 190,000 people are living in settlements in Uruguayan territory. Celia Ortega, a representative of that organization, said that it is \u201cstriking\u201d because \u201cthe poverty numbers (in Uruguay) are decreasing, but the settlements are still growing.\u201d\n\nThere is an explanation for the paradox: the measures taken by the governments of Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez and Mujica were not focused on helping people out of poverty, but on presenting \u201cfavorable statistics.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, Mujica tends to talk about painful matters frivolously, and he is also a great fabulator."}}
