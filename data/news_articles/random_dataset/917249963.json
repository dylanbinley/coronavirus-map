The high-schooler was found stabbed to death in a rural area days later.\n\nBryce Dickey, 18, of Spring Creek, is charged with sexual assault and open murder with the use of a deadly weapon. Elko County prosecutors have also proposed the alternative charge of felony murder during a sexual assault or attempted sexual assault, and they\u2019re reserving the option of seeking the death penalty.\n\nOn Wednesday, after a two-day preliminary hearing, Elko County Justice of the Peace Mason Simons said there was probable cause for Dickey\u2019s criminal case to be bound over to district court. Dickey will enter a plea at a future hearing.\n\nAfter the hearing concluded Wednesday afternoon, Britney\u2019s mother, Alisha Tolhurst, told The Daily Beast the proceeding was \u201ca lot to take in.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe overall feeling is, it\u2019s another step in the right direction for finding justice for our daughter,\u201d Tolhurst said. \u201cWe\u2019re still digesting things that we heard.\u201d\n\nBritney, born Gabrielle Lynn Ujlaky, went missing on March 8. Her body was discovered three days later in the remote Burner Basin area, which is known as a local hangout for hunters and high school students. Investigators initially said Britney disappeared after entering the pickup truck of a mystery man in a cowboy hat, but that story was apparently fabricated by Dickey, who was the last person to see Britney alive.\n\nBritney\u2019s parents previously told The Daily Beast that Britney referred to Dickey as a close friend, met him through the local rodeo circuit, and even listed him as her \u201cbig brother\u201d in her cellphone contacts. After Britney was found dead, Dickey attended a candlelight vigil and comforted her family and friends.\n\n\u201cSomebody had told me he\u2019d been having a hard time with his \u2018sister\u2019 being gone,\u201d Tolhurst said. \u201cI walked up to him and grabbed his face with both of my hands. I said, \u2018Please, honey. Please don\u2019t beat yourself up. You\u2019re a good kid.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe looked me dead in the eyes and didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Tolhurst told The Daily Beast of her encounter with Dickey at the vigil. \u201cThis kid is a psychopath.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will never, ever be able to understand how someone she trusted hurt her,\u201d Tolhurst added.\n\nTolhurst described Dickey as a \u201cshy little cowboy kid,\u201d who\u2019d politely reply to her by saying, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d She said Dickey and his father would visit the Mexican eatery where she used to work. \u201cI knew him well,\u201d Tolhurst said of the alleged killer. \u201cIn fact, when he and his dad came into the restaurant, I made such a big deal about telling his dad, \u2018You have such a nice kid. I just love him.\u2019\u201d\n\nBritney\u2019s father, James Ujlaky, was first to testify at the hearing on Tuesday. He said Britney was watching his band practice in Elko, near Angel Park, on the Sunday that she disappeared. Dickey picked Britney up before the practice concluded, Ujlaky testified, and Britney told her dad she\u2019d beat him home.\n\nBut Britney never showed up. Ujlaky reported his daughter missing to the Elko County Sheriff\u2019s Office hours later, after being unable to reach her. \u201cI was repeatedly calling her all the way home and I sent a text, \u2018Why aren\u2019t you answering my calls?\u2019\u201d Ujlaky testified, according to a local newspaper, the Elko Daily Free Press.\n\nCheyenne Fry, a friend of Britney\u2019s, testified that she exchanged Snapchat messages with Britney the day she disappeared. Dickey was pictured in one of two Snapchat videos Britney shared with Fry that afternoon. \u201cShe looked pale and I asked if she was OK. She said she was having a day,\u201d Fry testified.\n\nAccording to Fry, Dickey called her that afternoon and claimed he dropped Britney off at Spring Creek High School but \u201ctried to stop her\u201d from hopping into a pickup truck with an unidentified new friend. Fry said she did not know of Britney having any kind of romantic relationship with Dickey. \u201cShe didn\u2019t like him like that,\u201d Fry testified.\n\nFry previously told The Daily Beast that Britney \u201clooked up to\u201d and \u201ctrusted\u201d Dickey. \u201cShe was beautiful, smart and amazing and trusted you as long as you didn\u2019t screw her over or she knew you were a good person,\u201d Fry said last month. \u201cShe was wrong about Bryce.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Washoe County assistant medical examiner Dr. Julie Schrader told the court that Britney\u2019s manner of death was homicide, and that her cause of death was strangulation and a stab wound to the neck. Schrader testified that Britney was alive when she was stabbed.\n\nAuthorities discovered a pair of brown, blood-stained boots in Dickey\u2019s bedroom closet and a knife was tucked inside one of the shoes. They also found a sweatshirt with blood stains inside a toolbox in a pickup truck, according to the testimony of Elvira Koeder, a Washoe County forensic investigator.\n\nThe bloody boots and sweatshirt were also mentioned in a declaration for probable cause filed with the criminal complaint against Dickey.\n\nIn that declaration, cops said search warrants executed on addresses associated with Dickey yielded a pair of brown boots, which contained blood, along with a sweatshirt containing blood inside a vehicle at one of those residences.\n\nDickey was arrested March 19 shortly after one of several interviews with police.\n\nJames Ujlaky called the Elko County Sheriff\u2019s Office on March 8 around 8:45 p.m. to report Britney missing. A deputy then contacted Dickey, who claimed Britney told him to drop her off at Spring Creek High School to meet a friend. Dickey claimed that male friend was tall, wearing a cowboy hat, and driving a green Ford F150 pickup.\n\nBetween 8:30 and 9 p.m., two patrol deputies separately spoke to Dickey and a \u201cmale juvenile\u201d who were out searching for Britney, the declaration states.\n\nOne of those deputies, Michael Loup, testified at Tuesday\u2019s hearing that Dickey claimed Britney got into a green Ford F150 pickup truck with a stranger. \u201cHe told me he was unable to see the license plate,\u201d Loup said.\n\nDickey also allegedly informed Loup that Britney\u2019s primary means of communication was through Snapchat. When Loup asked Dickey if Britney had any boyfriends, Dickey and his friend indicated Britney was speaking to a man from out of state.\n\nAccording to the probable cause declaration, a deputy contacted Dickey again on March 9, and the murder suspect claimed he drove around with Britney for three-and-a-half hours before dropping her off in the high-school parking lot.\n\nDuring an in-person interview on March 10, Dickey said he picked Britney up at 1:30 p.m. from Angel Park in Elko. Dickey showed police Snapchat messages he sent to Britney\u2019s phone at 6:14 p.m. and 6:20 p.m., asking where she was and if she was okay. Dickey denied having a sexual relationship with Britney, the declaration states.\n\nDickey told investigators that a friend of Britney\u2019s contacted him at 5 p.m. on the day Britney vanished. The friend told Dickey she couldn\u2019t get a hold of Britney, the court filing says.\n\nOn March 11, Elko County investigators\u2019 search for Britney came to an end. Authorities discovered her body, which was dumped at the Burner Basin area and was \u201cpartially covered by a tarp and was partially clothed,\u201d the declaration states.\n\n\u201cThere was also what appeared to be several areas of blood near the edge of the roadway with a trail of disturbed earth leading to the body,\u201d the document adds. \u201cA condom wrapper was observed lying in the roadway near the south side of the road.\u201d\n\nThe Elko Police Department interviewed Dickey on March 13, and Dickey once more described the vehicle of the \u201cmystery man\u201d who supposedly took off with Britney. Dickey\u2019s descriptions of the vehicle \u201ccontradicted earlier statements [he] made during previous interviews\u201d with sheriff\u2019s deputies, the declaration alleges.\n\nDickey again denied he was ever in an intimate relationship with Britney. Asked why his DNA would be found on Britney, Dickey said it wasn\u2019t unless there was a possible \u201chair.\u201d The alleged killer consented to providing a DNA sample.\n\nOn March 14, authorities searched the desert area where Britney\u2019s body was discovered and found a pair of Apple earbuds and a used condom. Three days later, investigators learned both Britney\u2019s and Dickey\u2019s DNA profiles were located on the condom.\n\nOne of Britney\u2019s friends showed investigators Snapchat videos and images of Britney and Dickey in a vehicle together between 3:30 and 4 p.m. on March 8. The friend told police that Britney was wearing Apple earbuds and some jewelry (which authorities did not find).\n\nSurveillance footage in the area showed Britney walking to Angel Park at 3:22 p.m. on March 8 and getting into a blue Chevy pickup truck matching Dickey\u2019s vehicle\u2014which was nearly two hours later than when Dickey claimed to pick Britney up.\n\nVideo also showed what appeared to be Dickey\u2019s vehicle passing the entrance to the Spring Creek High School parking lot at 3:45 p.m., further contradicting his statements to police, according to the declaration.\n\nOn March 19, the Elko County Sheriff\u2019s Office interviewed Dickey once more. They told him they had evidence that implicated him in Britney\u2019s death. According to the declaration, \u201cMr. Dickey ultimately admitted to investigators that he had engaged in sexual contact with [Britney] with the use of a condom.\u201d\n\nToward the end of Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Dickey\u2019s lawyer, Gary Woodbury, asked Elko County detective Nick Stake whether the medical examiner\u2019s report would include whether Britney had alcohol in her system when she died. Stake said such tests would be part of the autopsy report, once it\u2019s complete.\n\nWoodbury then asked Stake about a supposed sexual encounter, followed by a confrontation, that Dickey claimed to have with Britney.\n\nStake testified that Dickey claimed in a March 19 police interview that he and Britney engaged in sexual activity. Woodbury then asked Stake whether Britney was upset about the alleged encounter and had been \u201cthreatening\u201d Dickey.\n\n\u201cI did not hear anything that would lead me to believe there were threats,\u201d Stake testified.\n\nSupport for victims of sexual violence:\n\n"}}
