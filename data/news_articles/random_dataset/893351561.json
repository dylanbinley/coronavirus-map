German forces pushed the center of the line so far back that its bulging appearance on maps gave the battle its common name. It is also referred to as the Ardennes Counteroffensive.\n\nThe forces were able to hold off the German counteroffensive, which had the goal of breaking the allied front in two. Once reinforcements arrived, the Allies were able to push back and turn the tide of the battle by Christmas.\n\nFOREIGN OFFICIALS ATTEND\n\nThe Consul General of Belgium in New York, Frank Geerkens, and the Consul General of Luxembourg in New York, Jeanne Crauser, attended Monday\u2019s event to express their nations\u2019 gratitude for the Americans who fought in the battle.\n\n\u201cThe people of Luxembourg will always be grateful to the American people and to the American soldiers who fought to defend their freedoms,\u201d Crauser said.\n\nAfter the Allied forces turned back the Nazis, the Battle of the Bulge carried on for a little over a month before coming to an end Jan. 28, 1945. Following the battle that killed around 19,000 Americans, the Allied forces were able to make their way into Germany bringing the war in Europe to an end within five months.\n\nMonday\u2019s event was organized by the Staten Island chapter of Veterans of the Battle of the Bulge. Its president, William Abell, expressed his gratitude, but noted the dwindling number of World War II veterans.\n\n\u201cWe only have two veterans here (at the event),\u201d Abell, whose father served in the Battle of the Bulge and son just returned from Afghanistan, said. \u201cWe were a group of maybe 75 at one time. Now we\u2019re down to two or three or four guys, so that hurts.\u201d\n\nAttendees included representatives from local veterans\u2019 organizations, and a group of about 50 students from St. Adalbert\u2019s School in Elm Park.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defence Mark Esper gives a speech during a ceremony to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge at the Mardasson Memorial in Bastogne, Belgium on Monday, Dec. 16, 2019. The Battle of the Bulge, also called Battle of the Ardennes, took place between Dec. 1944 and Jan. 1945 and was the last major German offensive on the Western Front during World War II.

U.S Secretary of Defense Mark Esper attended multiple events in Belgium and Luxembourg commemorating the anniversary, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"Their efforts not only defended America but also ensured that the peoples of Europe would be free again,\u201d Esper said."}}
