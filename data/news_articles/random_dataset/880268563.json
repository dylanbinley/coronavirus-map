The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he\u2019s meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Friday, fueling optimism about a positive outcome from this week\u2019s high-level trade talks.\n\n\u201cBig day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet on Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. and China began their principal-level negotiations in Washington on Thursday. Trump\u2019s comment about a meeting with Liu contrasted with a report from the South China Morning Post that said the two sides made no progress in deputy-level trade talks this week and Liu will cut his visit short.\n\nStocks surged after the president\u2019s tweet, rebounding from a wild overnight session sparked by the SCMP article as well as multiple other media reports.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Liu told Chinese state-run media Xinhua, \u201cThe Chinese side has come with great sincerity and is willing to make serious exchanges with the U.S. on issues of common concern such as trade balance, market access and investor protection, and promote positive progress in the consultations,\u201d Liu said.\n\nStill, tensions between the two economic superpowers reached a fever pitch earlier in the week. The U.S. blacklisted 28 Chinese entities over alleged human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, while putting visa restrictions on Chinese officials involved. China responded \u201cstay tuned\u201d for retaliation against the blacklist.\n\nBloomberg News reported overnight that the White House is working up a partial deal to suspend next week\u2019s tariff increase in exchange for a currency pact. The New York Times also reported that the Trump administration is granting licenses for some U.S. companies to sell nonsensitive supplies to Chinese telecom giant Huawei."}}
