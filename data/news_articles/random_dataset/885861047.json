Mass rallies calling for an overhaul of the ruling system have rocked the capital Baghdad and the Shiite-majority south since October 1 \u2014 the largest and deadliest popular movement in Iraq in decades.\n\n\n\nThe bloody unrest has sparked serious concern from the UN, human rights groups and the White House, which on Sunday called on Baghdad \u201cto halt the violence against protesters\u201d and pass electoral reform. After weeks of paralysis, Iraq\u2019s top leaders seem to have agreed to keep the system intact, but the UN in Iraq (UNAMI) urged them to enact a host of changes. These include electoral reforms within two weeks, the prosecution of those responsible for the recent violence as well as of corrupt officials, and the passing of anti-graft laws.\n\n\n\nYesterday, UNAMI chief Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert met the country\u2019s highest Shiite authority, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, in the holy city of Najaf. She said the seat of Shiite religious power in Iraq, known as the marjaiyah, had stressed that \u201cpeaceful demonstrators cannot go home without sufficient reforms\u201d to answer their demands.\n\n\u201cThe marjaiyah expressed its concerns that the political forces are not serious enough to carry out such reforms,\u201d said Hennis-Plasschaert. \u201cIf the three authorities \u2014 executive, judiciary and legislative \u2014 are not able or willing to conduct these reforms decisively, there must be a way to think of a different approach,\u201d she warned without elaborating. There was no statement attributable directly to Sistani, who is 89 and never appears in public. In his recent sermons, delivered by a representative, Sistani has described the protesters\u2019 demands as \u201clegitimate\u201d and called for the rallies to be handled with \u201crestraint\u201d.\n\nRallies flare up\n\nIn recent days, more than a dozen protesters have been killed as security forces have cracked down on demonstrators. They have cleared streets and squares in Baghdad, in the port hub of Basra and the southern city of Nasiriyah, where four protesters were shot dead on Sunday. Security forces there even chased down demonstrators into a children\u2019s hospital and fired tear gas inside.\n\nYesterday, protesters struggled to come out in large numbers there and security forces reopened roads in Basra, stifling attempts to stage sit-ins near the provincial headquarters. In Baghdad, live rounds rang out in neighborhoods close to the main protest camp of Tahrir (Liberation) Square. But thousands of demonstrators took to the streets again in Hillah, Diwaniyah and Kut.\n\n\n\nAside from the crackdown, activists and volunteer medics have described a widening campaign of arrests and intimidation intended to keep them away from protests. The UN has warned that \u201ca climate of anger and fear has set in,\u201d and its human rights council was to meet later yesterday for a periodic review of Iraq\u2019s rights record.\n\n\u2018We want total change\u2019\n\nIraq\u2019s President Barham Saleh had last month proposed an early vote after reforms, but the suggestion seems to have been widely rejected by the political class. Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi cast them as unrealistic and even firebrand cleric Moqtada Sadr, who first demanded snap elections supervised by the UN, has gone silent.\n\n\n\nThe initial fissures among the political elite appear to have closed this week following a consensus brokered by Major General Qasem Soleimani, the head of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 foreign operations arm. Soleimani, who often appears in Baghdad in times of political crisis, has led a series of meetings with Iraq\u2019s top-tier politicians, sources told AFP.\n\n\n\nThe agreement, they said, included a series of reforms in exchange for keeping the broader system in place. Those proposals will likely fall short of the demands of protesters, who demand a complete overhaul of a regime they see as deeply corrupt. Demonstrators say the current system means government jobs are doled out based on bribes or nepotism, shutting out applicants who are politically independent.\n\nYouth make up 60 percent of Iraq\u2019s nearly 40 million people and the unemployment rate among them stands at a staggering 25 percent, according to the World Bank. One in five people lives below the poverty line, despite the vast oil wealth of OPEC\u2019s second biggest producer. \u201cWe don\u2019t want amendments, we want change \u2014 total change,\u201d one protester in Baghdad said yesterday. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this government, or parliament, or any political party.\u201d \u2013 AFP"}}
