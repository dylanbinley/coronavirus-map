Using what you have does/could lead to cache poisoning and other exploits ... which are bad for those who access your Moodle. Same as http vs https.\n\n\n\nSo in your internal network, an internal DNS server would map private IP to a FQDN (fully qualfied domain name) that is the same as public DNS ... use the public FQDN.\n\nIn your Moodle config wwwroot has one value that matches the public FQDN.\n\nNow since you have been running it the way you have and developed some content with the 'short name' (www/) or IP address ... which could have been the private IP or the public IP, you need to run search and replace. The DB for moodle uses the $CFG->wwwroot to concatate (build) internal links ... those are full links with protocol + hostname + tld.\n\nLeaving it the way you have it configured now will mean hickups that you really can't control. Best to have server be 'in control' than browser.\n\n\n\n'SoS', Ken\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
