Republicans including Speaker Larry Householder (R-Glenford) have said they\u2019re hoping to do a fix before the EdChoice application process opens February 1. But State Sen. Teresa Fedor (D-Toledo) said she doubts it.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve known about it since the budget. The deadline for that change is February 1. The House isn\u2019t returning until the last week of January. So are they serious?\u201d\n\nFedor said the House won't return for a voting session till January 28. She criticizes Republicans for shortchanging Ohio children.\n\nBuilding for the future\n\n\u201cBoth the House and the Senate have to start getting serious about public education and supporting public education for the benefit of our children and to modernize our education system. They deserve that, not politics as usual in the Statehouse.\u201d"}}
