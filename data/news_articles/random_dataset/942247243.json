Also, well detailed proposals for revenues generation by the agency for 2021-2022 must be included in the expected comprehensive records,\u201d Senator Adeola said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Senate to probe hike in price of foreigners\u2019 residence permit\n\nMany of the heads revenue generating agencies invited by the committee on Friday for interactive sessions on their 2021 revenues projections, like the DPR were absent on alleged grounds of indisposition and hospitalisation.\n\nAmong them include the Nigeria Inland Waterways (NIWA), Bank of Industry (BOI) and Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON).\n\nThey were, however, ordered by the committee to reappear next Monday.\n\nHeads of BOI and SON were said to be indisposed or hospitalised while NIWA\u2019s boss reportedly travelled abroad.\n\nMeanwhile, when the committee chairman demanded for the hospital the SON DG, Osita Aboloma was being treated, the agency\u2019s Director of Budget, David Okon replied \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d.\n\nJoin the conversation\n\nOpinions"}}
