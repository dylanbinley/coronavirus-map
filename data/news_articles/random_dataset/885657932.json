Shoals\u2019 boyfriend, who knew Darling by his nickname, then got out of his girlfriend\u2019s SUV and approached the pair, according to Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Lorin Jenkins.\n\nThe unidentified suspect then pointed a gun at Shoals\u2019 boyfriend before digging through his pockets and taking $20, Jenkins said. When the boyfriend refused to get the other occupants out of the SUV, the suspect handed the gun over to Darling.\n\nThat\u2019s when Darling fired around eight shots at the SUV, striking Shoals in the back of the head a she attempted to drive away, Jenkins said. After the SUV struck a parked car, Shoals\u2019 boyfriend began driving her toward a hospital until they crossed paths with an ambulance.\n\nShoals was ultimately transported to the University of Chicago Medical Center and pronounced dead the following day, according to Jenkins and the Cook County medical examiner\u2019s office.\n\nA witness who saw Darling running from the scene with a gun recognized him by his nickname and told investigators that he previously lived near the intersection of 71st Street and Union Avenue. Detectives used that information to identify Darling, according to Jenkins, who said Shoals\u2019 boyfriend and the other witness then identified him from photo lineups.\n\nTen days after the shooting, officers investigating another incident in the 7300 block of South Union found a loaded .40 caliber pistol, Jenkins said. Subsequent testing found the gun matched ballistic evidence found at the scene of the fatal shooting.\n\nDarling was arrested last week on a warrant in Atlanta and flown back to Chicago to face the murder charge, according to Chicago police. Anne French, Darling\u2019s public defender, said the alleged gunman has lived in Cook County his entire life and is currently unemployed.\n\nDarling was convicted in 2016 of felony counts of aggravated assault to a police officer and aggravated unlawful use of a weapon after pointing a loaded gun at cops in Englewood, Jenkins said. He was sentenced to two years in prison, court records show.\n\nAfter noting that his record shows he has \u201ca propensity to use weapons,\u201d Judge Charles Beach denied Darling bail. His next court date is scheduled Tuesday.\n\nRead more on crime, and track the city\u2019s homicides."}}
