The site itself was previously called \"The Six Grandfathers\" by the Lakota Sioux before it was carved with the presidents' faces.\n\n\"Nothing stands as a greater reminder to the Great Sioux Nation of a country that cannot keep a promise or treaty than the faces carved into our sacred land on what the United States calls Mount Rushmore,\" Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Chairman Harold Frazier said in a statement condemning Mount Rushmore and the Trump event.\n\nYoung has spoken out against Trump and the use of his songs at rallies in the past, writing an open letter earlier this year critiquing Trump's presidency and throwing support behind former Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\n\n\"Your policies, decisions and short term thinking continue to exacerbate the Climate Crisis,\" Neil Young wrote in the open letter to Trump. \"Our first Black president was a better man than you are,\" he continued, referring to former President Obama.\n\nFurther down in his letter, Young, a frequent Trump critic, also took aim at the president over his campaign's usage of his song, \"Keep on Rockin' in the Free World\" at events, saying it's \"not a song you can trot out at one of your rallies.\""}}
