Jurisdiction is a key factor in this and other similar cases around the country as plaintiffs face bigger hurdles in federal court.\n\nIt was first filed in D.C. Superior Court, the equivalent of D.C.\u2019s state court. Defendants like Exxon removed it to federal court, where they had success fighting off lawsuits by Oakland, San Francisco and New York City at the trial court level.\n\n\u201cThe District states that removal was improper because the District\u2019s Complaint does not raise any federal claims, and the Superior Court is the appropriate forum for adjudicating the exclusively District law claims brought pursuant to the Attorney General\u2019s authority under the Consumer Protection Procedures Act,\u201d the motion to remand says.\n\nThe latest trend is to send these cases back to various state courts, like federal judges in Rhode Island, Baltimore and Colorado have. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has also overturned the decisions against Oakland and San Francisco and told the federal trial judge to reconsider the jurisdiction issue.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s 30-page decision was written by Judge Sandra Ikuta, a George W. Bush nominee, and joined by judges Morgen Christen and Kenneth Lee. In it, the panel said Judge William Alsup erred last June when he dismissed the climate lawsuits because they failed to state a claim that could be resolved by the judiciary.\n\nAlsup\u2019s decision was a blow to the politically connected private law firms that are pursuing climate lawsuits on behalf of cities and counties around the country and will earn tens of millions of dollars in fees if they win their multibillion-dollar claims.\n\nSince Alsup's ruling, climate change plaintiffs have scored several significant victories, including winning remand to state court of lawsuits by the cities of Baltimore, Providence, R.I., and Boulder, Colo. Opponents of climate litigation say it represents an attempt by environmentalists and profit-seeking private lawyers to use the courts to achieve goals they cannot accomplish through the political process.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit didn\u2019t return the Oakland and San Francisco cases directly to state court, instead giving Judge Alsup another chance to determine whether his court has jurisdiction to hear the lawsuits. If he doesn\u2019t find jurisdiction, the panel ruled, the cases must return to state court. One possibility the judge raised, of using federal maritime, is precluded because the oil companies didn\u2019t raise it in prior filings, the appeals court ruled.\n\nWeekly Newsletter Sign-up and get latest news about the courts, judges and latest complaints - right to your inbox.
