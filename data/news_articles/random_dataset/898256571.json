Davis was also facing charges of bail jumping, and intimidating a victim with the threat of force that was read in but dismissed for his plea deal.\n\nThe charges stem from a July 1st incident where Davis was found inside an apartment at Rocket Apartments by another man. Davis pulled a knife on the man, 25-year-old Camry Cooper, and started swinging to attack Cooper. Cooper was stabbed in the back and penetrating his lung.\n\nDavis is being credited for 190 days already served in prison. He will also spend his extended supervision in Indiana once his prison sentence is completed."}}
