The shouts of \u201cKate! Kate!\u201d overwhelmed the arrivals space at New York\u2019s Rainbow Room, site of the seventh-annual Fashion Media Awards, produced by fashion-industry publication The Daily Front Row.\n\nThat cacophony was no match, however, for the quiet, but decidedly more impactful moment that followed once the awards ceremony commenced, when Indya Moore picked up the award for Cover of the Year, for appearing on Elle\u2019s June 2019 issue. \u201cSome of you may be uncomfortable with the politics of my speech,\u201d the model and Pose actor began. \u201cRight now the Supreme Court is voting on whether or not trans people can access employment, shelter and health care in the same ways that you all have access\u2026it\u2019s hard to celebrate being celebrated at a time when people like me are being murdered.\u201d\n\nMoore said they wanted to use the moment to highlight the plight of black transgender women murdered by gun violence and, with that in mind, worked with stylist Ian Cogneato to create dangling earrings that featured framed photos of the murder victims. Cogneato worked with jewelry designer Areeayl Yoseefaw to design the pieces, while Moore said that, as the ceremony neared, they hoped they would be able to stop at 16 victims. And then Bailey Reeves, a 17-year-old trans teen from Baltimore, was murdered Sept. 2.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m carrying her in this frame,\u201d Moore said as they held up Reeves\u2019 photo for the audience. Of the Elle cover, the first time a transgender person has appeared on the U.S. version of the magazine, Moore noted that \u201cfor me there is little honor in being the first, but there is only honor in not being the last,\u201d before adding that they hoped agencies like IMG, William Morris Endeavor and CAA would \u201ccontinue to uplift marginalized people.\u201d\n\nPresenters and award recipients alike took a moment in their subsequent speeches to thank Moore for their words, while earlier on the red carpet, British Vogue editor in chief Edward Enninful \u2014 awarded Magazine of the Year, presented by Yara Shahidi and model Adut Akech, his September cover stars \u2014 pointed to societal changes as a key reason for the magazine\u2019s success during his tenure. \u201cWe\u2019re such a small team in London,\u201d he told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cWe\u2019re all working in what we believe in \u2014 inclusivity, diversity \u2014 and the world has really embraced us, so I\u2019m really honored.\u201d\n\nHost Graham Norton kicked off the night by introducing Tommy Hilfiger, who presented Zendaya with her Fashion Force award. \u201cRight after she receives her award, she\u2019s going right back to work in our studio,\u201d Hilfiger noted of their continued fashion collab, which launched last year. \u201cYou are a changemaker, and it\u2019s so inspiring to watch you making fashion more inclusive, more diverse and more meaningful.\u201d\n\nWearing a velvet suit and pussy-bow blouse from her latest Tommy collab, Zendaya explained that she considers fashion to be an emotional choice, while her longtime stylist, Law Roach, also helps to put it in perspective. \u201cHe asks me, \u2018When you step outside, what is that emotion inside you, what do you care about? That\u2019s the only opinion that should ever matter,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nOther honorees included Emily Ratajkowski, presented with the Fashion Entrepreneur award for her Inamorata swim and body brand, as well as Frederic Fekkai with the Beauty Innovator award, photographer Zoey Grossman (who shot Moore\u2019s Elle cover) and Halima Aden as the year\u2019s Breakthrough Model, presented to her by fellow model Ashley Graham, who showed off her recently announced baby bump in a skintight crimson latex dress.\n\nThe night\u2019s guests included Daily Front Row editor in chief Brandusa Niro, Christian Louboutin, Maye Musk, Sailor Brinkley Cook, Alexander Lundqvist, as well as a healthy representation of social-media stars and influencers. On the red carpet Musk discussed her friendship with Louboutin and recalled the two pairs of shoes he gave her for her 70th birthday, one pair each at the parties that took place in both New York and Los Angeles.\n\nTold how fantastic she looks for 70, Musk noted, \u201cActually, I\u2019m 71.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut 71 is the new 51,\u201d Louboutin added.\n\nThe night\u2019s other surprise? Honored with the Style Icon award, Moss\u2019 acceptance speech ultimately was brief, just a few words beyond \u201cThank you very much.\u201d But there was a reason for her brevity, as she revealed in the elevator as she departed the Rainbow Room with friends at the end of the night. \u201cI\u2019ve just never been one for giving speeches,\u201d she was overheard saying. \u201cOff the stage, you can\u2019t shut me up.\u201d\n\nSept. 10, 8:30 a.m.: Updated after Moore tweeted Sept. 9 that their preferred pronouns are they/them."}}
