She thought about finding a commissary kitchen where they could continue to cook for feed the front lines and other community organizations, which the team has been doing throughout the pandemic, and do a little takeout and delivery on the side. Instead, she has become the queen of pop-ups.\n\nSince May, Branca held a five-night pop-up at the open-air, rooftop Bok Bar in South Philly, settled into a kitchen residency at the Goat in Rittenhouse, and started planning for the private Fitler Club\u2019s first pop-up open to the public, taking place this Sunday. Later this month, she\u2019ll set up one-night events at the rooftop Sunset Social and outside at Walnut Street Cafe, and plans to host something in the Poconos.\n\nPart of the decision to go the pop-up route was based on rent, Branca says. Even at a commissary kitchen with no retail space to host diners, she was looking at a five-year lease, which she wasn\u2019t ready to commit to. At regular restaurant spaces, the rents she was seeing matched pre-pandemic prices, despite dining rooms being closed and the business model for restaurants turning on its head.\n\n\u201cWhen we share space with friends who [own restaurants], we contribute to their rent a little bit, but we aren\u2019t taking on that huge risk of signing up for five years in a space,\u201d says Branca, who owned Sat\u00e9 Kampar with her husband, John.\n\n\u00a9 Courtesy of Ange Branca For a pop-up series at the Bok Bar, Ange Branca of Sat\u00e9 Kampar grilled whole fish.\n\nAt least with the pop-ups, especially the long-term one at the Goat, she can keep her core staff intact, though their hours are less predictable. It\u2019s also an opportunity to cook dishes that wouldn\u2019t have made sense at her East Passyunk Avenue restaurant.\n\n\u201cWe built the kitchen and restaurant at Sat\u00e9 Kampar for one specific experience,\u201d says Branca. \u201cEven though there are so many Malaysian dishes that I love, sometimes I held back from serving them because it didn\u2019t quite work for the experience.\u201d\n\nThe grill at the restaurant, for example, was specifically built for satay, the marinated skewered meats that were the focus of the menu. While that grill didn\u2019t have space to accommodate whole fish alongside the other menu items, at her Bok Bar pop-up Branca decided whole grilled fish was perfect for the outdoor setting.\n\n\u201cI saw the sunset the first night at Bok Bar and it reminded me of the sunset at beach towns in Malaysia,\u201d she says. \u201cWe would always go to these little huts with a big charcoal grill and eat whatever the fishermen caught that day, grilled really simply with rice and a variety of sauces. It\u2019s a fun and relaxing way to eat, and very connected with nature.\u201d\n\nThe Bok Bar pop-up sold out each night. But tackling the Goat summer residency required a different process. \u201cWe were trying to figure out how to make our food make sense at an Irish pub, with beer and sidewalk seating,\u201d Branca says. She opted to go with the double patty, omelet-wrapped, sambal mayo-tinged Ramly burger, a Malaysian street food favorite that pairs well with beer.\n\nFor the Fitler Club on August 16, she\u2019s teaming up with Fishadelphia, a Philly-based seafood company with a focus on local fish, to highlight lesser-known, sustainable types of fish and encourage diners to branch out from salmon and tuna. There are two seatings for the dinner; both are $65 per person.\n\n\u201cMy view of sustainability is to eat all types of fish that are available,\u201d Branca says. \u201cAnd you eat fish from head to tail. We\u2019re not going to fillet anything \u2014 everything will be grilled from head to tail.\u201d\n\nAt the upcoming Sat\u00e9 Kampar pop-up at Walnut Street Cafe in University City (the date has not been announced), Branca wants to take diners on a tour through Malaysia by cooking dishes from different villages she\u2019s visited. The idea is to recreate some of the regional flavors she remembers from visits home, and give people a taste of travel during the pandemic, while actual travel is ill-advised.\n\n\u201cI have so many memories of traveling through Malaysia,\u201d Branca says. \u201cThe menu [for Walnut Street Cafe] is set up to tell those stories, because we can\u2019t travel. And of course I want to go back home so badly, so I\u2019m using these dinners to transport myself.\u201d"}}
