A dry scalp is often itchy and flaky. Such dryness and flakiness may cause an intense itch or even burning when one goes to get hair colored.\"\n\nWhile many people may associate dry scalps with dandruff or flakes, Dr. Fusco explains that dryness can present itself in a variety of different ways.\n\n\"Everyone has a different definition of dandruff,\" she explains.\n\n\"To some people, it is just a dry flaky scalp,\" she maintains. \"In the most severe cases, it is something called seborrheic dermatitis, where there is an overgrowth of yeast on the scalp.\"\n\nWhile the overgrowth of yeast, called Pityrosporum, is seen in more acute cases, Fusco says that flakes can be a result of something as simple as sensitivity to a particular ingredient or even from cleansing hair too infrequently.\n\n\"Some individuals find that by not shampooing frequently enough, they get a buildup of dead skin, oil and hair care products that can lead to itching and appear as dandruff,\" Fusco continues.\n\n\"Certain hair care ingredients can aggravate or even trigger what appears to be a dry flaky scalp,\" she adds, mentioning that Formalin, Paraben, Hecachlorophene and Miranol are four ingredients have been proven to cause shampoo-induced dermatitis.\n\nAdditionally, she suggests avoiding products with alcohol, paraben, and acrylates because they can exacerbate dryness, while products with natural oils, hyaluronic acid, tea tree oil and Vitamin B3 can increase moisture.\n\n\"Any dandruff shampoo with zinc pyrithione will both hydrate and combat dandruff,\" she suggests.\n\nAt-home hair masks like the Macadamia Professional Nourishing Repair Masque ($36, Amazon) and Living Proof Restore Dry Scalp Treatment ($43, Ulta) are a favorite of the doctor's because of the use of Vitamin 3 to balance scalps ecosystems, but Dr. Fusco also says using humidifiers can help.\n\nOur team is dedicated to finding and telling you more about the products and deals we love.

It is natural and dissolves as it rinses so it leaves no residue.\"\n\nWhile at-home hair masks might be a good option for some patients, others may be better off consulting a dermatologist.\n\n\"If it is persistent, uncomfortable or persistently itchy, a visit to a dermatologist may be necessary to determine if it\u2019s eczema, an allergy, seborrheic dermatitis or psoriasis.\"\n\nMore from :\n\nHere are the top-rated auto-curlers, starting at just $50\n\nHurry!
