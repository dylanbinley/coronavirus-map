As a result, Kroger plans to develop an exit strategy for the Kingsdale site in Upper Arlington,\u2019\u2019 according to the statement.\n\n\"We are still growing and investing in that growth, as demonstrated by our $3.1-million investment at Kroger located at 1955 West Henderson Road, Upper Arlington, in 2019.\"\n\nKroger bought the 6.2-acre Kingsdale site for $10.5 million in January 2015, within days of Macy\u2019s announcement that it was closing the store. Lazarus opened the store in 1970 and operated it until it became a Macy\u2019s.\n\nKroger said when it bought the site that it planned to redevelop a mixed-use project on the property, but it never presented plans and the site remained empty.\n\nKingsdale, at Tremont Road and Northwest Boulevard, also contains a Giant Eagle Market District store.\n\nLast month, the Columbus Landmarks preservation group named the 105,000-square-foot former Lazarus building one of its nine most-endangered buildings of 2020.\n\nImmediately north of the former Macy\u2019s store, a Barnes & Noble store at the point of Kingsdale is also shuttered. A phone message at the store said the store has closed and directed customers to other Barnes & Noble stores.\n\njweiker@dispatch.com\n\n@JimWeiker"}}
