(More are likely to sign on following the summer recess.)\n\nThe bill\u2019s broad appeal is no coincidence.\n\n\u201cIt gets the largest reaction response from membership,\u201d Hadassah CEO Janice Weinman said in a recent interview, adding that it is her biggest applause line when she goes out to chapters.\n\nPaikin Barall is a good fit for its bipartisan mission: She was a political appointee in the President George W. Bush State Department\u2019s antisemitism monitoring office, and then for a number of years was director of mid-Atlantic advocacy for the Orthodox Union. The latter job required cultivating the Democratic-majority legislatures that typify East Coast states.\n\n\u201cKaren has been instrumental in our congressional outreach,\u201d Weinman said.\n\nOn Friday, following two weeks of partisan warfare in Washington on what it means to be pro-Israel \u2014 culminating with President Donald Trump\u2019s gibe that Jews who vote Democratic are \u201cdisloyal\u201d to the Jewish state \u2014 Hadassah put out a call for bipartisanship.\n\n\u201cPitting people and parties against one another will sacrifice the goal of respect for diversity and coexistence,\u201d the group said. \u201cHadassah is committed to the bedrock values of our two nations and urges our leaders to end the politicization of this essential relationship.\u201d\n\nHarder still may be keeping an increasingly polarized Jewish electorate on board. The group\u2019s Israel agenda tacks slightly to the right, endorsing bills targeting the boycott Israel movement \u2014 bills that left-wing Democrats reject as infringing on free speech rights. Hadassah also advocates for changes in Palestinian textbooks considered anti-Israel.\n\nOn the left, the group advocates for reproductive rights, and its state chapters are organizing protests against increasingly restrictive abortion laws.\n\nHadassah\u2019s language on reproductive rights will never please most Republicans, but also hews closely to how Orthodox groups describe their position on abortion, reflecting a membership in which all religious streams are represented.\n\n\u201cReproductive health choices, based on full and accurate medical information and guidance, must be made in accordance with a woman\u2019s own religious, moral and ethical values,\u201d a handout says.\n\nThe group\u2019s core mission remains to raise funds for the two Jerusalem hospitals bearing its name. Again, its pitches are tailored to the younger Jewish women Hadassah hopes to attract.\n\nHospitals remain a nexus of Jewish-Palestinian coexistence in an environment where that is increasingly rare, and that\u2019s an aspect the organizations stresses in its U.S. outreach. Hadassah\u2019s Israel-based podcast, \u201cThe Branch ,\u201d has as its focus what it terms Israel\u2019s \u201cshared society.\u201d\n\nHadassah says it is on the right track after a financial crisis at the once-private hospitals led to a restructuring plan supervised by Israel\u2019s Finance Ministry.\n\nHadassah is partnering as well with the former Jewish Women\u2019s Renaissance Project on a heavily subsidized yearlong program called Momentum \u2014 informally \u201cBirthright for Moms .\u201d The program, which is designed to connect Jewish families to Jewish tradition and Israel, includes eight days in Israel.\n\nAlso emphasized are Hadassah\u2019s breast cancer research (for an Ashkenazi Jewish population at slightly higher risk) and infertility treatment (for a demographic heavy with professional women who are likelier to wait until their mid- to late 30s to start families).\n\nThe new Hadassah member is younger and wants a professional networking element attached to her extracurricular activities. Hadassah now boasts \u201caffinity groups\u201d for physicians, nurses and lawyers who meet and are as likely to exchange information about their fields, including innovations and job opportunities, as they are to raise money for Israel.\n\nWeinman said that membership, including female members and male associates, has fallen to 300,000 from a peak of 358,618 in 1986-87.\n\n\u201cIt has gone down not because we have not maintained a level of membership but because of attrition,\u201d Weinman said. \u201cWe are not making up in the same numbers those who have died.\u201d\n\nPrograms now are shorter, Weinman said, to accommodate busier women and include a transactional element.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s less of an extended commitment the way Hadassah members in the past have made,\u201d she said. Today\u2019s Hadassah meetings are pitched as benefiting members as much as they are opportunities for giving, although Weinman is quick to point out \u201cthey are not frivolous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey choose their subject not from a generic or ideological perspective but personal, what affects their families and futures, how do they network,\u201d she said.\n\nHadassah\u2019s unwitting role in Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme, the worst in U.S. history, remains a sore point. An official half-jokingly warned a reporter not to mention his name ahead of the Weinman interview.\n\nHadassah scaled back operations after the Madoff scandal blew open in late 2008, and eventually shut its Washington office, among other measures. In 2011, Hadassah returned $45 million to other investors, just under half its earnings under the fraudulent scheme, which paid early investors from money garnered from more recent investors instead of from actual earnings on the investments.\n\nMadoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison for his crimes.\n\nJewish lawmakers from both parties told JTA that they were pleased to see Hadassah back in business.\n\n\u201cIts advocacy is unmatched and it\u2019s an honor to work with its members on important legislation, such as the Never Again Education Act, to combat anti-Semitism through Holocaust education, and the Peace and Tolerance in Palestinian Education Act, bipartisan legislation I introduced with Rep. Brad Sherman,\u201d said Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y.\n\nSen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., the lead sponsor of the Never Again act in the Senate, told JTA: \u201cI\u2019m working with faith-based organizations like Hadassah on important policies like the Never Again Education Act because we must educate our students on the important lessons of the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nA decade after the Bernie Madoff debacle \u2014 one so serious that Hadassah officials refuse to even utter the Ponzi schemer\u2019s name \u2014 the women\u2019s Zionist organization is back."}}
