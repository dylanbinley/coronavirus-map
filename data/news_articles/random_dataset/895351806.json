Firefighters used ladders up to the balcony below the window from which the residents had jumped.\n\nA fire at a Lawndale apartment building forced several people, including children, to jump from the third floor window early Friday in a dramatic escape caught on video.\n\n\"There were people hanging out of that third floor window on the front side of the building and a couple people started to hang jump out,\" Hroma said. \"Smoke started to pump out of that window so they were probably starting to feel some heat from the fire below them and in the rear of the building.\"\n\nA total of eight adults and 10 children were in the building at the time, officials said. All were accounted for and evacuated to a warming truck on the scene, authorities said. No injuries were reported.\n\nThe fire was escalated to a still-and-box for more resources, according to Hroma, who said it was brought under control by around 5 a.m., with firefighters staying on the scene to finish extinguishing the flames.\n\nThe cause of the fire remained under investigation."}}
