TPA did pass but TAA didn\u2019t. TAA is considered necessary for TPA to work. TPA is the fast-track authority. It\u2019s the process, not the deal itself.\n\nTAA is being brought back on Tuesday and Wednesday. What will the GOP do to make it acceptable if anything?\n\nStripping TAA out of TPP is unacceptable to Progressives and it is unlikely the conference vote will pass both the House and Senate if TAA remains as is.\n\nAll trade deals include a TAA.\n\nIf TAA goes down, so does TPA. TAA spends large sums of taxpayer money to compensate workers for lost jobs by way of unemployment and social welfare programs et al. TAA is actually pork barrel spending to get trade deals through and doesn\u2019t really work. The trade deals are usually worth it.\n\nAnother alternative to get TAA passed is for the House to reconsider TAA, perhaps putting even more tax dollars into it. It would need 80 votes to pass which would include a large number of Republicans. The pressure is being put on them as I write this.\n\nThere was a lot of talk about the Democrats being offended by Barack Obama impugning their character on the day of the vote as he was trying to convince them to vote for it, but what they really want is more money for TAA or a halt to proposed amendments limiting climate change and immigration.\n\nTPP, which is the trade deal Republicans want to boost our economy, shows they can fight for things when they want to.\n\nJohn Boehner is probably bringing TAA back for a vote Wednesday. He might be confidant it will pass after he presents a better deal for the Democrats.\n\nTPA is fast-tracking a trade bill \u2013 TPP \u2013 that allegedly sets up a massive Trans-Pacific Union with a treaty that will not need 67 votes in Congress to pass and which will turn over some amount of power to the Union. We don\u2019t know how much because we the people aren\u2019t allowed to read even the draft. It could affect our sovereignty but we don\u2019t know for sure or to what degree. It\u2019s a pig in a polk.\n\nLarry Kudlow railed on behalf of the TPA \u2013 fast-track authority \u2013 and the TPP bill itself on his show Saturday.\n\nKudlow said TPA is a simple agreement that presidents are routinely given. It\u2019s not new and its merely a process.\n\nHe thinks opponents are being revengeful but I don\u2019t believe that. The reason is a lack of trust, not revenge. Kudlow thinks opponents are protectionists and xenophobes only. He said the handful of congressmen against it are trouble makers.\n\nWe can\u2019t be protectionists but does that mean we have to be globalists? One of the Sentinel writers, Jim Soviero said that people should consider if Barack Obama is a free trader or a globalist and use that as a benchmark.\n\nKudlow assured Americans trade is in our best economic interests and the concerns about immigration and climate change are just not true. TPP will go online once it\u2019s finished and there will be an opportunity to vote against it. While it\u2019s a treaty, TPA waves that constitutional requirement of 67 votes however.\n\nOne of Kudlow\u2019s callers and a strong supporter \u2013 Tom \u2013 called Kudlow The Oracle in a complimentary way. He said he was against TPA because he read it and he pointed out number 7 in TPA which he interpreted as saying you cannot back off the environmental stuff that\u2019s in the bill and that Mr. Obama is doing right now in this country. The listener said that to him it means that we are stuck with Mr. Obama\u2019s oppressive regulations.\n\nKudlow said those words are meaningless because TPA is only a process and that language is to make the left comfortable. Kudlow wasn\u2019t aware of number 7 and had no knowledge of it. He hadn\u2019t read TPA. If he hasn\u2019t read it, why is he discussing it?\n\nThe section the caller referred to is probably this one:\n\n(7) to seek provisions in trade agreements under which parties to those agreements ensure that they do not weaken or reduce the protections afforded in domestic environmental and labor laws an encouragement for trade;\n\nThis clause likely means we won\u2019t compromise the environment for trade \u2013 trading on the environment can\u2019t be used as a bargaining chip. I don\u2019t think the clause is a problem, but, again, in the hands of Barack Obama, who knows. I\u2019ve linked the TPA at the bottom and you can read it and judge for yourself.\n\nKudlow conceded the words might need to be removed but that could be done.\n\nWhat Mr. Kudlow (who I also consider an Oracle) is ignoring is the fact that people on the right simply don\u2019t trust Mr. Obama and with good reason. He is adept at twisting words to meet his agenda \u2013 words matter and he doesn\u2019t necessarily interpret them the way the rest of us do. Who knows what he will negotiate away and when it comes back to Congress, the Democrats can get it passed if 67 votes are not required.\n\nOn Friday, Nancy Pelosi gave a speech on the House floor and I\u2019ve included three sections of interest because it seems possible that Nancy Pelosi will move ahead with TAA and take her followers with her if she gets a better deal.\n\n\u201cEnvironmental justice \u2013 looking at these prohibitions on dealing with climate and 11 other countries in the world, and then our own. [There are GOP amendments to prevent Mr. Obama from negotiating climate change and immigration goals] Now, again, I commend the President, because in the Fast Track bill, there are some good provisions on the environment \u2013 issues, I\u2019m talking about an ethic, a responsibility, a comprehensive view of the future. And again, the Pelosi Amendment addressed the indigenous people, all these people who will be not of the first, shall we say, priority for many of these countries as they make their economic decisions.\u201d\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\u201cSo while I\u2019m a big supporter of TAA, if TAA slows down the Fast Track, I am prepared to vote against TAA. Because then, its defeat, [I\u2019m] sad to say, is the only way that we will be able to slow down the Fast Track.\u201d\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\u201cFor these and other reasons, I will be voting today to slow down the Fast Track, to get a better deal for the American people \u2013 bigger paychecks, better infrastructure, help the American people fulfill the American Dream.\u201d\n\nThese amendments are very troubling to the left. That doesn\u2019t mean they have ulterior motives but they might.\n\nNancy Pelosi is right when she says voting against TPA slows the process. That\u2019s all many of us want.\n\nThere are a number of items in the draft bill itself that have been leaked. One issue of concern is that foreign governments can sue companies here in the U.S. and the taxpayers would be on the hook for it. While TPA is not the bill itself, it is giving up the 67 votes in the Senate so Mr. Obama can negotiate in secret, publishing TPP only when it\u2019s complete.\n\nWhy do we have to fast-track something \u2013 the draft of which \u2013 most of Congress hasn\u2019t read? What\u2019s the rush?\n\nContact John Boehner Monday at (202) 225-0600 or Call the Switchboard to contact your representative at (202) 224-3121. Take down the Capitol Hill phone lines.\n\nTPA: Trade Promotion Authority | United States Trade \u2026\n\nh/t John Velisek.
