That will give us a window to iron out questions and issues, and make sure we're as prepared as we can be when it comes time to move,\" she said.\n\nHer comments came as the Ministry of Health announced 29 new cases of COVID-19 in New Zealand. It's the fourth day in a row the number of new cases has dropped, bringing the total number of cases to 1239.\n\nThere continues to be a strong link to overseas travel, with 41 percent of cases being contracted this way. A further 44 percent are contacts of cases in New Zealand and two percent are community transmission. The rest are under investigation.\n\nIn terms of testing, the Ministry of Health's Director-General Dr Bloomfield says there were 3990 tests processed on Wednesday. The daily average over the last week is 3547.\n\nArdern also said early work was underway on a phone application to help with contact tracing."}}
