The brand was launched in 2009, nearly a decade ago, offering sporty leggings and tank tops for younger girls. The decision in 2017 to scale back Ivivva was an effort to pull the company out of a same-store sales slump and put investments toward its core adults business.\n\nThe winding down also means Lululemon will be pulling any remaining assortments of Ivivva merchandise out of eight Lululemon stores, where it still has shop-in-shops.\n\nMeanwhile, Lululemon has said it's working toward doubling its men's business, doubling online sales and quadrupling its international business by 2023.\n\nIt recently opened a massive, 20,000-square-foot store in Chicago, the first of its kind, which it plans to scale to other cities. It also launched a personal care line and is exploring other categories, such as footwear, where it can add new items outside of apparel to stores.\n\nLululemon shares have skyrocketed more than 55% this year. The company has a market value of $25.1 billion."}}
