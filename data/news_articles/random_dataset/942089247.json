Only travel if you are content to unexpectedly 14-day quarantine if required (I speak from experience!)\"\n\n(Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nHe told Sky News that Covid-19 is \"an unpredictable virus that doesn't play ball and can sometimes just take off in a country\".\n\nWhile sudden spikes \u2013 a 164% increase in cases in Croatia and a 93% increase in Austria \u2013 have knocked those countries off the \u201cair bridge\u201d list, a sharp decline in newly reported cases in Portugal has meant that Portuguese holidays are now back on the agenda.\n\n(Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nTravel companies have been quick to capitalise on the change, with prices of flights to Faro and Lisbon soaring overnight.\n\nDespite the massive price hikes, consumer group Which? said the change in rules for Portugal was \"likely to come too late to help many struggling holiday companies\" because so many summer holidays had already been cancelled.\n\n(Image: Pippa Fowles / No10 Downing Street)\n\nThe website\u2019s travel editor Rory Boland told the BBC that the government had \"now made it clear that countries can be removed or added from the travel corridor list at a moment's notice\".\n\nSaying that current government policy makes it \"too risky\" holidaymakers to travel to most popular destinations because of the danger of new quarantine regulations coming into force while they were away he added: \"Those holidaymakers who want to heed the government warning to not undertake non-essential travel to Spain, France and now Croatia and Austria are finding it increasingly difficult to claim a refund.\""}}
