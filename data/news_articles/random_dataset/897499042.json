Kanesh, told the court during mitigation that there were no casualties in the incident.\n\n\u201cThe beams fell due to strong wind at the time and there was a supervisor at the site,\u201d he said while asking for a lower fine.\n\nDepartment of Occupational Safety and Health prosecutor Mohd Najib Anuar told the court that the company should have ensured it adhered to all safety requirements and procedures before undertaking the works.\n\n\u201cThe company should have ensured the safety of the worksite during works at the site,\u201d he said.\n\nThe same company was faced with an amended charge for failing to provide engineering calculations by an accredited engineer for earth backfill works for a temporary slope which led to a landslide on October 19 in 2018 and thus failing to ensure safety and health of workers on the site.\n\nThe company\u2019s project manager Lai Sin Kian was also faced with an amended charge for the same offence.\n\nOsmera, who appeared on behalf of the company, and Lai both claimed trial to the charges under Section 15(1) of the OSH Act 1994.\n\nMazdi then fixed February 19 for trial.\n\nYuta Maju was the main contractor for the RM545.6 million Bukit Kukus highway project.\n\nA crane at the project site hit a beam which fell off the elevated highway to the ground below during construction works on October 11 in 2018.\n\nOn October 19, a landslide occurred on another portion of the construction site of the highway claiming the lives of nine foreign workers on the site.\n\nA 1.6km segment of the Bukit Kukus paired road linking Paya Terubong to Lebuh Bukit Jambul is scheduled to be open to public by August this year."}}
