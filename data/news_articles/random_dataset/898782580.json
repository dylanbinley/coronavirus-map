The announcement caught senior royals off-guard, who immediately cited \"complicated issues that will take time to work through.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s full statement from the queen read:\n\n\"Today my family had very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family.\"\n\n\"My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan's desire to create a new life as a young family. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working Members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family.\"\n\n\"Harry and Meghan have made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives.\"\n\n\"It has therefore been agreed that there will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK.\"\n\n\u201cThese are complex matters for my family to resolve, and there is some more work to be done, but I have asked for final decisions to be reached in the coming days.\u201d"}}
