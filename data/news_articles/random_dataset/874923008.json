For this revolutionary concept on the chemical nature of solutions Arrhenius was awarded the 1903 Nobel Prize for Chemistry.\n\nIn 1889 Arrhenius explained that most chemical reactions proceed only when an energy barrier, which he called the activation energy, is overcome. He formulated the famous Arrhenius equation expressing the quantitative relationship between activation energy, temperature and rate of reaction.\n\nBuilding upon the work of other great scientists like Fourier, Tyndall and Pouillet, in 1896 Arrhenius was the first to use the basic principles of physical chemistry to estimate the extent to which increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide would increase the Earth\u2019s surface temperature through the greenhouse effect. He calculated that human-caused carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel burning and other combustion processes were large enough to cause global warming.\n\nHis original work on this topic lies at the core of modern climate science. It is mind-boggling that here in 2019, 123 years after Arrhenius\u2019 pioneering work, there seems to be so little understanding of fossil-fuel atmospheric warming, as though it is some sort of evil fantasy concocted by Chinese communists, or Al Gore, or other unidentified malevolent enemies of Alberta out there trying to do us in.\n\nCredit U of L chemist Marc Roussel for his letter of Sept. 7 confirming that \u201cthe physics is clear: it will get hotter.\u201d\n\nOwen Holmes\n\nLethbridge\n\nShare this story:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10"}}
