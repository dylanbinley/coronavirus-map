At least 60 senior members of the security agencies and representatives of the civil society will undergo an interactive course facilitated by the US Institute for Security, Governance, Defence Security Cooperation Agency and the UK Department for International Development.\n\nThe course seeks to train the security agencies and civilians on the methodology of effective governance and creating a secure environment for the reforms process.\n\nLesotho\u2019s security agencies have been accused of impunity and human rights violations particularly during the previous Pakalitha Mosisili-led seven parties\u2019 coalition. Apart from civilians who were tortured and killed, two army commanders, namely, Lieutenant General Maaparankoe Mahao and Lt-Gen Khoantle Mot\u0161omot\u0161o were assassinated by fellow soldiers in 2015 and 2017 respectively.\n\nFormer army commander Lt-Gen Tlali Kamoli and several other high profile soldiers are currently in custody awaiting trial for murder and other atrocities committed during the tenure of the previous regime.\n\nUS Ambassador Gonzales has previously spoken out against human rights abuses, saying Lesotho risked losing out on the multi-million-dollar second compact under the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) due to concerns about \u201cunacceptable\u201d corruption and police brutality against citizens.\n\nAnd recently, Ms Gonzales cautioned the security agencies against sliding back to the era of impunity.\n\nShe urged Lesotho to stay the course and fully implement the security sector and other reforms.\n\n\u201cLesotho must make progress on reforms and not slide back,\u201d Ms Gonzales said.\n\n\u201cWhere challenges and/ or weaknesses exist, institutions must acknowledge and take steps to address them. From the Lesotho Correctional Service (LCS) to the Lesotho Mounted Police Service (LMPS), from the National Security Service (NSS) to the Lesotho Defence Force (LDF), it is essential that the security sector respects the rule of law and civilian leadership. Lesotho cannot afford to go back to the days of the security sector being dragged into politics. We cannot go back. So I urge you to stay the course.\u201d\n\nShe also said that so much had changed over the years since Lesotho gained its independence in 1966 and the changes had brought new security threats that needed to be addressed.\n\n\u201cNew technologies have emerged, terrorist groups and criminal networks have brought new threats, and natural disasters such as floods, drought and climate change continue to create new national security threats that the government of Lesotho must address.\n\n\u201cDoing so requires whole-of-government and whole-of-security sector approaches and this makes coordination and collaboration, clear institutional mandates and information and intelligence sharing absolutely essential. It is essential for Lesotho\u2019s senior law enforcement, military and government officials to work together.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Defence Minister, Tefo Mapesela, said the symposium had come at an opportune when the country was seized with the reforms process.\n\n\u201cLesotho\u2019s security institutions have historically been blamed for the political instability and insecurity of the country and the government therefore recognises the need for the reform of the security sector.\n\n\u201cIt is my sincere hope that this seminar will assist our security sector to better understand roles and missions of security institutions, strategic communication, leadership skills and government responses to national security challenges,\u201d Mr Mapesela said."}}
