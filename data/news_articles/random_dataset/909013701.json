According to Sotiris Tsiodras, the Athens University professor who heads the Health Ministry\u2019s committee of experts on contagious diseases, the third case involves a \u201cyoung woman\u201d who, he said, is being treated at the capital\u2019s Attikon hospital.\n\nMeanwhile experts at the National Health Organization (EODY) have been tasked with tracing those who have come into contact with her recently including fellow passengers on her flight to Athens from Milan.\n\nAs Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis appealed for calm, noting that \u201cour biggest adversary in such cases is panic,\u201d Health Minister Vassilis Kikilias said all Carnival festivities would be cancelled to avert the spread of the virus, in line with the response in other European countries affected by the virus.\n\nTwo schools in Thessaloniki \u2013 the primary school which \u201cpatient zero\u2019s\u201d son attends and an adjacent secondary school \u2013 were closed as a precaution for 14 days, the virus\u2019 maximum incubation period.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised, we expected this,\u201d Tsiodras said, adding that, \u201cthis virus does not respect borders.\u201d He reiterated that those with symptoms of the coronavirus \u2013 high temperature, cough and difficulty breathing \u2013 should remain at home and contact their doctor of EODY for advice.\n\nAs part of the response to contain the virus, it was decided on Thursday during an emergency session of the Athens Urban Transport Organization (OASA) that city buses will be disinfected daily, with an emphasis on bars and handles. It was also decided that television screens on buses will display messages with guidelines on hygiene for citizens to avert the virus\u2019 spread.\n\nThe Medical Association of Athens is launching an information campaign for citizens while the Panhellenic Pharmacists\u2019 Association is this week to distribute 500,000 informative leaflets to pharmacies with instructions for citizens on hygiene rules.\n\nMeanwhile, the national unions representing hospital doctors and workers have called for the immediate recruitment of additional employees to ensure intensive care units are adequately staffed and for the bolstering of medical supplies."}}
