His burial is yet to be announced.\n\n\u201cAmong other things, President Nkurunziza is remembered for accepting our advice to come out of the bush and negotiate with then President Buyoya in Arusha; a move that brought peace to Burundi,\u201d Museveni said while at the Burundian embassy in Kampala.\n\n\u201cI salute his contribution and his demise at such a young age is simply sad. Hakuna maneno mengi, ni kusema pole peke yake,\u201d President Museveni said Tuesday."}}
