Board members on Tuesday voted unanimously to issue the bond, which Greg Florian, vice president of finance and administration, said would be repaid over 12 years.\n\n\u201cWe want to offer our students a learning environment where they are engaged, not only as students, but as leaders and teachers that can help lead those classrooms,\u201d President Cris Valdez said.\n\nThe resolution approved by board members is one of the first steps in the beginning phases of the project, which will involve remodeling the main campus facility that provides classrooms, laboratories, offices and other support space. Local architecture firm, Because Life Deserves Design (BLDD), was previously selected by the board to carry out the plans to renovate various spaces throughout the campus.\n\nFlorian said the construction will be divided into two major phases. Work could wrap up in spring 2022."}}
