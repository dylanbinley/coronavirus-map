He also shared what he sees to be some of the challenges facing Vinnies stores today, such as understanding all of the different motivations that drive young people to participate in the second-hand economy, identifying any barriers to attracting young shoppers and new volunteers, ensuring they receive quality donations and continuing to improve the ways we can recycle items not fit for resale.\n\nThese are some of the issues that students could help solve. \u201cWith students from Business, Marketing, Sociology and Applied Psychology backgrounds enrolled in the Research Methods class, we are able to look at these challenges from multiple angles,\u201d says Dr St Guillaume.\n\n\u201cVinnies NSW is very pleased to be working collaboratively with the Notre Dame University. While the project is helping the students to build their desired skillsets and knowledge, it will also be of pivotal importance to Vinnies in gaining an insight into the motivations of younger customers. This will ensure we can continue to provide much-needed funds for our programs and services,\u201d says Mr Coyte.\n\nThe state\u2019s 230-plus Vinnies stores provide untied funds for charitable programs and initiatives run by St Vincent De Paul Society, which means the research done by Notre Dame students is set to have a positive impact on the bottom line of the shops and, in turn, benefit people in need. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be partnering with an organisation that has values aligned with our own here at Notre Dame,\u201d said Lecturer in the School of Business, Dr Jos\u00e9 Sakakibara."}}
