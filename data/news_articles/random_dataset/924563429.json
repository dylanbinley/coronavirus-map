However, in large, part the aim of the update will be to restate the position we\u2019ve set out a number of times on testing and supporting residents and is set out clearly in the HPS guidance of 1 May.\n\n\u201cThe guidance will be kept under constant review by the Care Homes Clinical and Professional Advisory Group and, should further updates be required in the future, we will share them with care homes as quickly as is possible.\u201d\n\nNew NRS statistics will be released today, Wednesday, May 20."}}
