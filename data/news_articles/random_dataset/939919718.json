The threat of a no-confidence motion has seen him finally accept the fact that he got this badly wrong.\u201d\n\nThe Scottish Greens and Liberal Democrats have not said if they will back the no-confidence motion.\n\nScottish Greens education spokesman Ross Greer said he welcomed John Swinney\u2019s \u201cadmission that the Scottish Government got this badly wrong\u201d.\n\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: \u201cAn admission of error is step one in resolving this major issue but the detailed solution is what matters.\n\n\u201cWhy we ever got into this sorry state is a question that needs answered too.\u201d"}}
