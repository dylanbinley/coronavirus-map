However, the advice from the Scottish Government is not to meet and protest outside as social distancing may not be possible, no matter the space that is used.\n\n\"Protest is always welcome and is part of our democratic process, but during this crisis the possibility of spreading the virus is still too great. I would recommend that people make their voices heard in other ways until we can safely meet in large gatherings once again.\u201d\n\nOne of the event's organisers, Liam Godwin, said they would restrict numbers to a maximum of 20 people, possibly no more than five households, to allow for social distancing.\n\nHe went on to point out that they had decided to make it more of an online campaign demanding justice for George Floyd such as one organised in Orkney on Thursday, and is urging people to join in and celebrate their solidarity.\n\nA Black Lives Matter peaceful protest taking in Nairn.

It is important to highlight the fact that the UK is not necessarily innocent.\"\n\nReferring to the Highland Clearances, the Thurso-based PhD student said that the Highlands had its own history of inequality.\n\nHe added: \"We think it is important to take a stance against this whenever we can \u2013 we are just a group of people trying to do our best.\"\n\nThey plan to assemble at 12.30pm and to \u201ctake the knee\u201d at 1pm.\n\nThose that would prefer to attend online can do so by sending photos of themselves holding their signs with words of support and solidarity tocaithnesscares@gmail.com\n\nMrs Ross has written to Scotland's education secretary John Swinney to ensure that the education system is representative of everyone in Scotland and signed a parliamentary motion by Fulton MacGregor reaffirming there is no place for racism in Scotland or anywhere else.\n\nShe added: \"I will always stand up for everyone\u2019s human rights, no matter their gender, background, race, culture, sexual orientation, beliefs or the colour of their skin.\""}}
