That includes the contents in the building to include the machinery, the metals that they use here as well as the damage to the building itself,\u201d says Stevens.\n\nThis comes after a fire broke out at the manufacturing facility around 5 PM on Wednesday. The company tells 47 ABC the investigation isn\u2019t complete but they believe it started in the part of the building where they do electrical plating with nickel and gold.\n\n\u201cI think the fire was caused by some plastic containers that we have in the plating shop,\u201d says James Collins, the CEO of EGIDE SA.\n\nOfficials are now figuring out how to safely clean things up since there were hazardous chemicals inside this building. \u201cBecause the fire company used water to put out the fire, there\u2019s a lot of concern over the environmental impact,\u201d says Collins.\n\nEGIDE tells 47 ABC they\u2019re prioritizing a safe and quick clean up, not only for the company\u2019s sake but for the more than one hundred people they employ. \u201cThis is a bump in the road that we want to take care of quickly and per regulations but the company will stay in Cambridge,\u201d says Collins.\n\nCollins says the company will try and support employees if the closure only lasts for a little while but otherwise they\u2019ll have to ask them to file for unemployment until they get back up and running."}}
