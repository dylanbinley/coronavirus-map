The program is intended for working parents on the front lines of combating the virus, including health care workers and first responders.\n\nMore information about registering for this new program can be found at www.bnymca.org/programs/school-break-days/.\n\nThe suspension involves group exercise classes, sports, senior activities, Kid Care, team practices, youth programs and swim lessons."}}
