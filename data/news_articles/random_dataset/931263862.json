We need a clear pathway for staff to follow. This is kind of the beginning for this.\"\n\nBut she said it \"needs to be clear\" this \"can't be an easier pathway than doing it the proper way\".\n\nShe said the current processes to address unauthorised homes required \"an enormous amount of time and energy\".\n\n\"It's very expensive, very draining but council doesn't end up with the money for the infrastructure,\" she said.\n\nCr Ndiaye said it would be helpful to have a timeline during which people could follow the process set out by the new policy, to clear a backlog of \u00adunauthorised dwellings but also prevent that process from being more desirable than the legitimate development application channels.\n\n\"I don't want it to be an ongoing thing,\" Cr Ndiaye said.\n\n\"I want there to be a period of time people can follow this process - like an amnesty.\"\n\nCr Ndiaye believed this \u00adperiod of time should span \u00adbeyond 12 months.\n\n\"We have, I think, a duty of care to our community not to just throw people out,\" she said.\n\n\"We also have a duty to provide staff with a process they can go through.\n\n\"All those things that come into play come into play with a normal DA as well. It's not in any sense a free-for-all.\n\n\"We have needed, this whole time, a pathway. And this has brought it to us on the back of an approval.\n\n\"Hopefully we can see some improvement in this space.\"\n\nMost councillors supported the resolution, with Cr Michael Lyon voting against it."}}
