Whatever you say, the Turkish minority of Western Thrace has been here for centuries and will remain Turkish.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish press also attacked the Greek President of his labelling, dubbing his statements \u201coutrageous\u201d.\n\nProkopis Pavlopoulos had said on January 18th during his visit to Evros in north-eastern Greece: \u201cRegardless of what is said and from whom, the truth under international law is one, a truth impossible to delete in any way. The truth is that under the Lausanne Treaty, the Muslim minority living in Thrace is a religious minority in no way a national minority.\u201d"}}
