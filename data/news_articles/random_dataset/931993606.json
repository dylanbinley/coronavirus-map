Groups that still hold this view include adults with a biblical worldview (93 percent); those attending an evangelical church (60 percent); born-again Christians (60 percent); political conservatives (57 percent); people 50 or older (53 percent); and Republicans (53 percent).\n\nSome religious groups had only a minority who viewed life as sacred, including those attending Pentecostal (46 percent), mainline Protestant (45 percent), or Catholic (43 percent) churches. Evangelicals were the group most likely (60 percent) to say that life is sacred, while spiritual skeptics were the least likely (13 percent).\n\nMore than one-in-three adults (37 percent) say \u201clife is what you make it, but it has no absolute value,\u201d while a little more than one-in-ten say \u201clife does not attain its full value until we reach our highest point of evolution and expression.\u201d Another one out of ten adults admitted they did not know how to appraise the value of human life.\n\nA majority of Americans are also unclear on the Bible\u2019s view of abortion. More than one-in-three (37 percent) say the Bible is ambiguous about abortion, while nearly another one-quarter of adults admit they do not know (22 percent). Almost one-in-three evangelicals also say the Bible is ambiguous on abortion.\n\nThe research also finds that almost seven out of ten of Americans (69 percent) see human beings as \u201cbasically good.\u201d A majority of every population subgroup examined adopted that view, ranging from a little more than half to more than three-quarters of those groups (including 70 percent of evangelicals). The segment least likely to say \u201cpeople are basically good\u201d are people with a biblical worldview (52 percent).\n\nA small majority of Americans (56 percent) believes human beings are created by God, and made in his image, but are fallen and in need of redemption. One out of every eight (12 percent) claims people are simply \u201cmaterial substance \u2013 biological machines.\u201d Another one-eighth (12 percent) argues that people are \u201cpart of the mind of the universe.\u201d Smaller numbers of people describe humans as \u201can illusion,\u201d claiming we do not exist; or as \u201csleeping gods, part of the soul of the universe.\u201d\n\nWhy It Matters: While these findings are lamentable, they are not altogether surprising. We should expect that Americans will adopt a paganized view of humanity as they move further away from a biblical worldview. But what is unexpected is that so many self-professed evangelicals are unable to answer these questions from the Bible.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple way to explain how the Bible answers these questions:\n\nAre people basically good? \u2014 Those who claim humanity is basically good are using circular reasoning, comparing the goodness of humanity to the relative goodness of some subset of humans. But when we compare our goodness against the true standard of goodness\u2014God\u2014we find that we are not good at all. This is why Paul says in Romans 3:10-12, \u201cNone is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.\u201d\n\nAre human beings God\u2019s creation, made in his image, fallen, and in need of redemption ? \u2014 Each of those claims is clearly stated in Scripture: Genesis 1:27 states that \u201cGod created man in his own image\u201d; Galatians 5:4 states that \u201cyou have fallen away from grace\u201d; and Galatians 1:3 says \u201cChrist redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us.\u201d\n\nIs human life sacred? \u2014 The reason some Christians may answer \u201cno\u201d to this question is a misunderstanding of the term \u201csacred,\u201d i.e., connected with God or dedicated to a religious purpose and so deserving veneration. Genesis 9:6 makes it clear that human life is sacred because we are made in the image of God: \u201cWhoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made mankind.\u201d\n\nIs the Bible ambiguous on abortion? \u2014 Ambiguous means open to more than one interpretation. While the Bible does not directly refer to abortion, a clear understanding of the relevant terms and concepts makes it clear that it is forbidden by Scripture. The term abortion means the removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus from the uterus, resulting in or caused by its death. An intentional abortion would therefore entail the killing of an innocent human life, which is clearly forbidden in Exodus 20:13."}}
