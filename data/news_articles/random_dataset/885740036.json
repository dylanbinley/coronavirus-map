They will make the judgment themselves and (decide) what kind of representatives they want for themselves in Parliament.\u201d\n\nMr Yeo confirmed his commitment to serve his constituents. \u201cAs for us PAP activists, we continue being focused on only one thing, to work very hard, with sincerity, and to show them that we will be here no matter how hard it is, we will be here serving them.\u201d\n\nThe PAP activist, along with polytechnic senior lecturer Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah, chief executive Rachel Ong, and lawyer Kawal Pal Singh, spoke at the PAP event last night concerning their activities and achievements in the recent past.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOn November 5, a motion was moved in Parliament by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, calling on AHTC to require Mr Low and Ms Lim to recuse themselves from the town council\u2019s financial matters.\n\nThe motion brought by DPM Heng, who is also Singapore\u2019s Finance Minister, would \u201caffirm the vital importance of MPs maintaining high standards of integrity and accountability.\u201d\n\nMr Heng\u2019s motion came on the heels of the recently delivered verdict of High Court Judge Kannan Ramesh, wherein he called out Ms Lim and Mr Low for improper and dishonest conduct.\n\nThe Judge said that the WP MPs \u201cacted dishonestly\u201d and were \u201cin breach of their fiduciary duties,\u201d which Mr Heng\u2019s motion reiterated, adding that Ms Lim and Mr Low\u2019s behavior \u201clacked integrity and candour\u201d.\n\nThe motion also said, \u201cMs Lim and Mr Low were fully aware that their conduct was of questionable legality,\u201d and asks the Members of Parliament to \u201caffirm the vital importance of MPs maintaining high standards of integrity and accountability\u201d.\n\nMr Low told the press on November 6 that on the matter of his and Sylvia Lim\u2019s future roles in the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC), that this is for the AHTC to decide.\n\nAdditionally, he said he will not participate in voting, or even talking about this issue.\n\nAt present, Mr Low is a member of AHTC\u2019s estate and community-liaison committee as well as an elected member of the town council.\n\nAs for what his political party (Workers\u2019 Party WP) would do in this regard, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to prejudge or anticipate what the town councillors will do.
