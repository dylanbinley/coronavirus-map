With so much at stake, and with a \u201cMiddle Eastern intelligence official\u201d telling two American newspapers that Israel was behind the blast at Iran\u2019s main nuclear fuel enrichment facility in Natanz, it seems highly probable that Israel was behind at least some of the destruction.\n\nBut instead of focusing on the very real threat of Iran achieving nuclear power, a recent op-ed by Simon Tisdall, foreign affairs commentator for The Guardian, characterises the latest sequence of events as \u201cbullying\u201d in a July 12 op-ed entitled, \u201cSabotage, sanctions and the bullying of Iran is bound to backfire on the west\u201d and even managed to blame the West for Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\n\nStay informed Let us know where to email your free, daily news roundups: I still want to receive the following emails from HonestReporting: Communiques and Alerts IsraBite Daily News Roundup What's New? Israel in Focus Development & Outreach SIGN UP NOW\n\nWhile most understand that the prospect of a nuclear Iran is one the world cannot accept, Tisdall chooses to focus not on Iran\u2019s slow, relentless march to the bomb, but on the response of countries compelled to act of genuine concern that one of the most repressive regimes on the planet may be on the way to gaining access to the most terrible weapon known to humanity.\n\nAs the suggestion that Iran is being \u2018bullied\u2019 wasn\u2019t bad enough, Tisdall goes on to claim that measures taken against Iran are the real cause of Iran\u2019s nuclear obsession:\n\nThe problem for Trump and fellow bully-boys Netanyahu and the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, is that their toxic recipe isn\u2019t working. In truth, the very opposite of what they supposedly want is happening\u2026 Iran, which has always maintained it does not want nuclear weapons, is now moving closer to acquiring a weapons manufacturing capability as a direct consequence of US bad faith.\u201c\n\nYou read that right. Tisdall not only credulously, uncritically cites Iran\u2019s claims that \u201cit does not want nuclear weapons,\u201d but then goes on to blame America\u2019s \u201cbad faith\u201d for the fact that Iran is inching closer to acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\nSpeaking of Israel\u2019s purported strikes against Iranian infrastructure, Tisdall disparagingly refers to possible American knowledge of the attack as \u201cconnivance,\u201d and uncritically quotes an Iranian spokesman who warned, \u201cThe method Israel is using is dangerous, and it could spread to anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nOf course, this is a regime that has spread its very own dangerous \u201cmethods\u201d far and wide in the Middle East, establishing proxy militias to fight in and control swathes of Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza and Syria.\n\nRelated Reading: The Regional Threat Explained\n\nMiscasting Opposition to a Nuclear Iran as Western Imperialism\n\nAt one point, Tisdall gives some background, explaining that \u201cBoth the US and Israel regard Iran\u2019s missile programme as a threat.\u201d\n\nVery true. But that sentence is woefully incomplete. So too does Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn fact, the Arab angle is almost entirely missing from this article \u2013 the specter of the rise of an nuclear Iran has Saudi and much of the Sunni Middle East extremely concerned, to the point that old foes have become new allies in a united front against Iran.\n\nThe convenient exclusion of Saudia Arabia serves to cast opposition to Iran as an outgrowth of the \u201cWestern imperialism\u201d that the Guardian so loves to castigate.\n\nPortraying Americans and Israelis as \u2018Hardline\u2019\u2026\n\n\u201cA political clean sweep beckons for those in Iran who, like their hardline American and Israeli counterparts, prefer confrontation to common sense.\u201d\n\nThis ties in with a common media misrepresentation of Benjamin Netanyahu as a warmonger. In reality, even staunch critics in Israel recognize the truth that, far from seeking \u201cconfrontation,\u201d Netanyahu is a risk-averse leader who has repeatedly declined to go to war.\n\nThe extent of Tisdall\u2019s willingness to attack the West is laid clear in the juxtaposition of two sentences: In one, he euphemistically refers to Iran\u2019s funding and arming of militias across the Middle East as mere \u201charmful meddling in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.\u201d In the next, he thunders that it \u201cIt is Trump, not the mullahs, who almost started a war by assassinating Revolutionary Guards general Qassem Suleimani in January \u2013 an extrajudicial killing the UN says was unlawful.\u201d\n\n\u2026 While Describing Iranian Leaders as \u2018Moderate\u2019\n\nIf Tisdall regards Israeli and American leaders as \u201chardliners,\u201d then how should the leaders of repressive Iran, a theocratic country which regularly brutalizes its own population, be described? Surely something more extreme?\n\nNot according to Tisdall.\n\nAs far as he\u2019s concerned, President Hassan Rouhani and foreign minister Javad Zarif are simply \u201cpro-western reformists and moderates.\u201d This is the same Rouhani who appointed Moustafa Pour-Mohammadi as Justice Minister. Pour-Mohammadi was dubbed \u201cminister of murder\u201d by Human Rights Watch, because he was responsible for Iran\u2019s mass execution of political prisoners in the 1980s. This is the same Javad Sarif who in 2006 refused to acknowledge that 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust.\n\n\u201cReformists\u201d and \u201cmoderates\u201d are, it seems, very relative terms. While the two may not be as extreme as others, they are far from truly pro-Western, and merely more diplomatic in promoting the Iranian drive to dominate the Middle East.\n\nRelated Reading: The Iran Regime\u2019s Incitement to Destroy Israel\n\nThe Real Story of Iran\u2019s Nuclear Obsession\n\nIran\u2019s 18-year long pursuit of nuclear weapons is well-documented. It has ploughed millions into developing centrifuges; built an array of research and enrichment facilities; employed hundreds, if not thousands, of scientists and other workers; and defied international pressure \u2013 all in the name of securing nuclear power.\n\nWhile Iran has insisted that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful, the international community has made clear it neither trusts nor believes Iran, with a group of world powers known as the P5+1 securing a deal in 2015 that saw tough economic sanctions lifted after Iran agreed to restrict certain nuclear development and permit international inspectors to enter the country.\n\nFor years, Israel remained suspicious, and in 2018, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went public with evidence procured from Iran that showed it had duped the international nuclear inspectors and cheated the agreement. Months later, the Trump administration announced that it would pull out of the deal with Iran and reimpose sanctions. In response, Iran has ramped up its nuclear development to ever-higher levels, sparking concerns of hostilities.\n\nRelated Reading \u2014 Iran: The Global Threat\n\nSo, just to be clear: Iran is one of, if not the single greatest state sponsor of terrorism on the planet. Its network of proxies reach into Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, and threaten to bring instability to the entire Middle East, and beyond. It has developed a fearsome obsession with Israel, holding events such as missile exhibitions displaying rockets marked with the phrase \u201cIsrael must be wiped off the map,\u201d and the wildly offensive \u201cInternational Holocaust Cartoon Competition.\u201d\n\n(Video: September 2019)\n\nAll of the above should serve to make abundantly clear that Iran is an international pariah which has long been single-minded in its pursuit of achieving nuclear power. Since 2002, Iran has worked relentlessly to develop nuclear capabilities with the aim of eventually attaining nuclear weapons, a threat so serious that it has led to the rise of alliances between Israel and multiple Sunni states, united in concern at the specter of the rise of a nuclear Iran.\n\nBut to read Tisdall\u2019s column, readers would be forgiven for having cause and effect reversed, and thinking that the Iranians\u2019 drive for the bomb is a reaction to Western interference.\n\nNothing could be farther from the truth.\n\nEnjoyed reading this article?
