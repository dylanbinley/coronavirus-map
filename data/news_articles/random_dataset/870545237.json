The reality star posted another sexy snap from the vacation.\n\nTeresa Giudice, 47, is back at home but she\u2019s got plenty of vacation photos to share! The Real Housewives of New Jersey star posted a super sexy set of photos rocking a low cut black mini dress to her Instagram account on Wednesday, September 4. Teresa looks away for the camera in all three photos as she poses in the seductive dress that shows off her sculpted legs, ample cleavage and toned arms. The mom of four has an incredible figure, and was also glowing with her gorgeous golden tan! In the photos, Teresa poses in front of a gorgeous pool at the five-star Belvedere Hotel in Mykonos \u2014 where she stayed on the getaway \u2014 and captioned the stunning images \u201cWherever you go, go with all your heart \ud83d\udc95.\u201d\n\nTeresa accessorized the deep-v, sleeveless dress with long earrings, gold bracelets and a pricey pair of Yves Saint Laurent tribute sandals. The sky high, open toe sandal features a platform and retail for just under a thousand dollars. Her makeup was glamorous and smoky, as always, while her highlighted brunette hair was blown out to perfection. Teresa finished her look with a summer ready white nail polish on her toes. She shared a photo from the same night on her Instagram account two days ago, tagging the location as celebrity hotspot Scorpios Mykonos. The restaurant is known for its a-list clientele, and recently hosted super models Gigi and Bella Hadid.\n\nThe trip wasn\u2019t without controversy, as Teresa\u2019s husband Joe Giudice, 47, remains in the custody of ICE while his fate is decided. As we\u2019ve reported, Joe was released from a Pennsylvania federal prison facility in March following a 41-month sentence for conspiracy and bankruptcy fraud. While Joe has lived in the United States since he was a small child, he was technically born in Italy \u2014 and could be facing deportation back to his native country. To add to the drama, Teresa was spotted not wearing her wedding ring on the trip, but a source exclusively told us that she just didn\u2019t want to lose the ring at the beach. They also added that the mom \u2014 who also served time in prison for the same charges \u2014 was just looking to \u201clive her best life.\u201d\n\nThe reality star has had a busy few days since touching back down in New Jersey, as her eldest daughter Gia headed off to college. The 18-year-old begins her freshman year at Rutgers College in New Brunswick, NJ \u2014 about 45 minutes away from home \u2014 this week. Gia\u2019s move was a family affair as her sisters tagged along, in addition to uncle Joe Gorga, who did all of the heavy lifting.\n\nFans seemed concerned about Teresa\u2019s trip to Greece amongst the family drama, writing, \u201cWhere\u2019s your husband??? Smh. Wrong. All wrong. Joe didn\u2019t even get to see his daughter off to college , but you go ahead and have a good time. Unreal.\u201d Others complimented her look, commenting \u201cStunning\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 you just get better and better\ud83d\udd25 like fine wine \ud83c\udf77\u201d and \u201cYou look fantastic!\u201d"}}
