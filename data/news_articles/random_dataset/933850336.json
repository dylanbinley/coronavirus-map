When solar operations are finished, land can easily be returned back to use for farming or mineral extraction, with minimal environmental impact.\n\nSolar energy production in Iowa has grown from around two megawatts in 2012 to about 115 today, according to the Lyons, Nebraska-based Center for Rural Affairs. Spurring that, in part, may be the fact that costs for developing utility-scale solar energy declined 89% from 2009 to 2019.\n\n\u201cUsing just 21 of Iowa\u2019s 55,857 square miles of land for solar photovoltaic (installations) would provide 10% of Iowa\u2019s electricity needs,\u201d according to the center\u2019s letter to supervisors."}}
