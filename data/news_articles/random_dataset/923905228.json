He'll be given credit for time served, which means he's due to be released in just a few months.\n\nGloria Henry, who organized the protest, called for him to serve more time in jail.\n\n\"I want everyone to know that all lives matter,\" she said. \"And if something like this was to happen to you, reach out and help the person, don't leave the person there to die.\"\n\nProsecutors say glass from the scene where Pierson was killed was matched with Gallimore's truck. They dropped a driving without a license charge he had been facing in connection with the incident."}}
