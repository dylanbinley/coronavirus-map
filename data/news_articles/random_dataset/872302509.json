This came in the final communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of their ordinary session (152) here, in which they said military escalation threatened Libya's stability and that of the neighbouring countries. The Ministers called for an immediate ceasefire, and a return to political talks, as the only way forward to retaining the country's stability and defeating terrorism. GNA Foreign Minister Mohamed Siala told the Russian Sputnik news agency 'the Arab Ministers meeting has ruled out completely military solution, and the decision was issued without any country expressing any reservation, which means an Arab unanimity on Libya.' =Lana="}}
