Deputy Prime Minister Salem al-Khanbashi told AFP that \u201cmen, women and children\u201d were among the 14 dead in Aden, where \u201cflooding also caused streets to shut down in most neighbourhoods\u201d. He added that sanitation infrastructure had been severely damaged and called for urgent aid to combat the spread of diseases, \u201cespecially cholera and other deadly viral infections\u201d. A government official told AFP at least 10 homes were destroyed and 90 others severely damaged. The flooding compounds the country\u00b4s troubles, as it struggles to fend off water-borne diseases and braces for the spread of the novel coronavirus, after recording one case so far. Oxfam said on Wednesday that it was \u201cextremely worried\u201d about the recent storms, which have also hit other provinces across the country."}}
