The Rocklands Hostel will be useful for Tahitian students or for medical evacuations, the Temaru government claimed at that time.\n\nBut most pro-autonomy parties criticized the move saying the hotel is both costly and unnecessary.\n\nThe French Polynesia Assembly already voted last January 29-13 to adopt a critical two-year-old inquiry report on the former Temaru government\u2019s purchase of the Rocklands Hostel.\n\nThe Tong Sang government announced two months later, in March, that the decision to sell the hotel had been taken.\n\nThis will be done when the outlook for the real estate market will be better, French Polynesia Vice-President Edouard Fritch claimed.\n\nA French audit delegation also insisted last June that French Polynesia should sell some of its most valuable assets - including the Rocklands Hostel."}}
