With little notice of the closures, school district scrambled to provide meals to students who rely on them.\n\nIn the Tigard-Tualatin School District, Metzger Elementary School was one of the first schools where kids could get a grab-and-go breakfast.\n\nCOVID-19 concerns may have shut down the school, but it didn\u2019t keep lead cook Rusty Nass from her kitchen.\n\n\u201cToday we\u2019re going to have French toast and a cheese omelet. Juice and milk, and this is the main meal,\u201d Nass told FOX 12.\n\nMetzger Elementary families have long known they could depend on Nass, but in uncertain times, that\u2019s more important than ever.\n\n\u201cI thrive on it,\u201d said Nass. \u201cI\u2019ve been with the district for 15 years, I\u2019ve known these kids since they were toddlers, preschool, little ones, all the way up to high school.\u201d\n\nTables set up outside the school Monday offered free food \u2013 some of it donated by community members.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to grab the kids some breakfast to start the day. They usually eat breakfast at school, and lunch,\u201d said parent Tressa Sotocobos.\n\nNass says she usually serves roughly 140 kids breakfast. She made enough for 50 on Monday not knowing how many would come by, and she said she would adjust if she needed to.\n\n\u201cWith schools being closed, it\u2019s kind of hard to add that extra grocery bill to feed the kids breakfast and lunch,\u201d Sotocobos said.\n\nThe school is also making sure grab-and-go lunches are ready for kids in need.\n\nWhile Sotocobos was taking her kids with her to work, she\u2019s not sure how well that will work out. She could soon face hefty child care bills.\n\n\u201cIt will be an additional $130 for a week of care times two,\u201d Sotocobos told FOX 12.\n\nFor the families who grabbed meals on Monday, there was comfort in knowing they weren\u2019t along and that others cared about them.\n\nBesides whipping up French toast, Nass also handed out generous gift cards \u2013 given to the school for its families by a local church group.\n\n\u201cThey just handed me a hundred dollar gift card from Costco so that\u2019s going to help. I\u2019m kind of tearing up about it. That\u2019s going to help a lot,\u201d said Sotocobos.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a family, we\u2019re a community, and we look out for each other,\u201d Nass said.\n\nOfficials at Metzger Elementary say you don\u2019t need to have a kid at the school to get a free breakfast or lunch. They will give them to anyone in the community in need between the ages of one and 18.\n\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.
