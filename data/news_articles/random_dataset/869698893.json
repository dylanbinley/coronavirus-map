Today, the Faberg\u00e9 Museum includes more than 1,000 pieces, making it the world\u2019s biggest collection of works by the legendary jeweller best known for his imperial Easter eggs.\n\n\u201cAny true collector makes a collection to put it on public display sooner or later and, ideally, create its own museum,\u201d Vekselberg said in an e-mail.\n\nFaberg\u00e9 Museum director Vladimir Voronchenko, a childhood friend of Vekselberg, said he\u2019s building it into a \u201cglobal brand\u201d. Nearly 690,000 people visited last year, an almost eight-fold increase from 2014, making it one of the most popular cultural destinations in St Petersburg.\n\nVekselberg is co-founder of Renova Group and has interests in more than a dozen companies, including a stake in United Comopany Rusal, the world\u2019s largest aluminum producer outside China, as well as shares of equipment makers Sulzer and Oerlikon. He\u2019s the nation\u2019s 10th-richest person with a $13.7bn fortune, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index.\n\nIn April 2018, the US treasury department included Vekselberg and Renova on a list of oligarchs, companies and senior government officials subject to sanctions that the US said was punishment for the country\u2019s actions in Crimea, Ukraine and Syria, and for attempting to subvert Western democracies. Voronchenko said the sanctions haven\u2019t affected museum operations.\n\n\u201cLike me, Viktor has always been an active collector,\u201d Voronchenko said, adding that they both started in the early 1990s with icons and classic paintings of old Russian masters.\n\nIn 2004, Vekselberg acquired an iconic collection of more than 200 Faberg\u00e9 items from the Forbes family for about $100m. Carl Faberg\u00e9, who provided Russian emperors and noblemen with numerous precious works over four decades, fled the country shortly after the Bolshevik revolution in 1917. He\u2019s best known for a series of 50 Easter eggs that Russia\u2019s last two czars gave as gifts to close relatives. The Faberg\u00e9 Museum has nine of them.\n\nVekselberg said his purchase of the Forbes collection was made possible after he and his partners sold a 50% stake in Tyumen Oil in 2003 for almost $7bn. \u201cFortunately, I had enough available money.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the famed eggs, Vekselberg\u2019s Faberg\u00e9 collection includes other pieces of jewellery, silverware and religious objects. The museum also displays works of other Russian jewellers and silversmiths who were Faberg\u00e9\u2019s contemporaries. The entire collection includes more than 4,000 items.\n\nEmperors and Dukes\n\nIrina Stepanova, head of Sotheby\u2019s Russia, said Faberg\u00e9 pieces are always among the top lots when they come up at auction. In 2007, a Faberg\u00e9 egg made in 1902 for the Rothschild banking family fetched an auction record \u00a38.9m. \u201cBuying a Faberg\u00e9 item is like buying Marie Antoinette\u2019s tiara,\u201d Stepanova said. \u201cYou get a thing that was in the hands of emperors and grand dukes.\u201d\n\nAfter the collapse of the Russian empire, Faberg\u00e9 masterpieces were dispersed around the world. Many were sold by the fledgling Soviet republic to American industrialist Armand Hammer in exchange for wheat and other products.\n\nHammer helped make Faberg\u00e9 a household name among collectors in the US, which has two world-class sets of works: the Lillian Thomas Pratt collection donated to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and Dorothy and Artie McFerrin\u2019s private collection.\n\nDali and Kahlo\n\nIn contrast with the US, most museums in Russia are state-owned, though there are some exceptions. Energy billionaire Leonid Mikhelson is building a $130m centre of contemporary art in Moscow. Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club, and his former partner, Dasha Zhukova, founded Moscow\u2019s Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in 2008, and covers part of its annual $22m budget.\n\nVoronchenko said he has sought to attract new visitors with exhibits unrelated to Faberg\u00e9. In 2017, works by Salvador Dali were on display, and early last year the museum showcased paintings by iconic Mexican artist Frida Kahlo.\n\nVekselberg views the endeavour as more of a hobby and a charity than anything else. \u201cThe museum isn\u2019t a business for me.\u201d\n\nBloomberg"}}
