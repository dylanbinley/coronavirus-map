He also said presently, we were in Phase II of the outbreak, which has now been classified as a pandemic by World Health Organisation.\n\nHe added that coordinated effort will help avoid Phase III, which is community transmission.\n\nRecently, a 23-year-old man who had coronavirus-like symptoms got himself admitted to a private hospital. However, he was later asked to visit Naidu hospital to get tested. \u201cI had cough and fever and hence visited a private hospital. They asked me to got to Naidu to get my samples tested. However, they did not allow me as I did not have foreign travel history. They asked me to go back to the private hospital,\u201d he said. There, the man was asked to get a written document stating that he did not have coronavirus. The man said he had recently travelled from Bihar and worked at Pune.\n\nWhen asked, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Pune President Dr Sanjay Patil said a provision was being made to set aside isolation wards/beds at 10 private hospitals. He also said strict action should be taken against those spreading fake videos about coronavirus and causing panic among public.
