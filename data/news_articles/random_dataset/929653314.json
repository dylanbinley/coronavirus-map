Tshaka's body was found dumped in an open field in Mthatha by a passer-by on 5 June 2020. Zenani has since appeared in the Mthatha Magistrate's Court on Thursday, 11 June. He will be appearing in the same court again on 18 June 2020 for a formal bail application,\" read the statement.\n\nIn KwaZulu-Natal, Msunduze Reserve, a 52-year-old Bhekukwanda Cele has appeared in the Ndwedwe Magistrates Court, charged with the alleged murder of his estranged wife, 31-year-old Nwabisa Mgwandela.

The suspect remains in custody until his next court appearance.\n\nIn another incident in the Western Cape, last month a suspect was arrested for the alleged murder of his girlfriend, 34-year-old Nomfazi Gabada. The suspect, Sithembele Klaas, was initially arrested earlier this month but the case was withdrawn. The investigating officer persevered in this matter and obtained a warrant for the arrest of Klaas. He was then traced and rearrested on Saturday. Klaas will be brought before a Magistrate at the Khayelitsha Magistrates Court today.\n\nPolice in the statement said in all the cases where suspects have been arrested, the victim was in a relationship with the suspect.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines South Africa Governance Women By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.
