The comparison drew widespread attention in a time of reckoning for the recent killings of Black Americans in the name of law enforcement.\n\nIn a press release, Bristol County for Correctional Justice shared a picture of a tie sold on ConfederateShop.com that featured a similar pattern and color scheme, though its stripes were noticeably thinner than those on Hodgson\u2019s tie. The website calls the product an \"Old South Confederate Necktie.\"\n\nAnother Confederate apparel store, DL Grandeurs Confederate and Rebel Merchandise, sells a version of the tie with wider stripes that bears a stronger resemblance to the one worn by Hodgson.\n\nHodgson said the tie is not a Confederate symbol, and indicated through a spokesman that he does not support neo-Confederate or white supremacist groups.\n\n\u201cI wore the tie in this 17-year-old photo because it had patriotic colors (red, white and blue), and not because it \u2018resembled\u2019 some fringe neo-anglo-confederate-whatever group from hundreds of years ago that I\u2019d never heard of until yesterday,\u201d Hodgson said on Twitter.\n\nThe sheriff dismissed the comparisons as politically motivated and indicated through a spokesman, Jonathan Darling, that he has no plans to apologize for wearing the tie or displaying the portrait.\n\n\u201cNo one has ever had a problem with it or questioned it until the left-wing political activists peddled the fictional confederate narrative to the media last week,\u201d Darling said. \u201cHe is not planning on removing it.\u201d\n\nBut LaSella Hall, president of the NAACP\u2019s regional chapter in New Bedford, said the tie deserves a closer investigation because of the company Hodgson keeps, citing his public appearances with Trump, who recently criticized nationwide efforts to remove Confederate memorials, and Hodgson\u2019s role on the board of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which features several members Hall said he considers white supremacists.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s likely that he is sympathetic with white supremacists,\u201d Hall said, \u201cjust like if you go to a disco club there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re going to do some dancing.\u201d\n\nU.S. Sen. Ed Markey, embattled in a reelection campaign that\u2019s seen both candidates criticize Hodgson, weighed in as well, triggering a spat with the sheriff on Twitter.\n\n\u201cNo one, especially someone in law enforcement, should be wearing confederate symbols and doubling down on them when called out about it,\u201d Markey wrote.\n\nBut Ted Widmer, a Civil War historian teaching at the City University of New York, found the tie\u2019s symbolism more ambiguous. Widmer said there\u2019s a blurry line between Confederate iconography and more widely accepted symbols of U.S. patriotism.\n\n\u201cConfederate iconography was fairly rooted in U.S. iconography,\u201d Widmer said. \u201cThey had stars and stripes and red, white and blue. And that\u2019s because the strangeness of the Civil War: we were fighting against our fellow Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think as responsible historians we have to give people the benefit of the doubt,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this case, what the sheriff is saying is plausible. He might\u2019ve just bought a tie with stars on it that he liked. If we don\u2019t know I think we need to say that we don\u2019t know. We\u2019re seeing a lot of movement and anger on both sides, and to me that means we need to be really precise.\u201d\n\nHoward Graves, an analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center who researches white supremacist groups, has said the design on Hodgson's tie is popular among people involved in neo-Confederate movements.\n\nContext, however, is key, he said.\n\n\"Every use of white star on a blue background in front of a red banner isn\u2019t necessarily created to deliberately evoke the confederate battle flag, as is the case with the necktie featured in the photograph in question,\u201d Graves said.\n\nDarling said Hodgson does not remember where he purchased the tie, \u201cbut based on the year he knows he didn\u2019t buy it online.\"\n\nThe sheriff probably purchased it from \"a store somewhere in the Dartmouth area,\" Darling said.\n\nStaff writer Ben Berke can be reached at bberke@enterprisenews.com"}}
