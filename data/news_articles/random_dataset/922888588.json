Its monarchy is one of the youngest in Europe and began in 1815 following the Congress of Vienna at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Full independence under the Grand Dukes came just under 20 years later, when the Treaty of London enshrined Luxembourg's existence in international law and ended years of rule by the Burgundians, French, Prussians and the Dutch. Although part of Luxembourg was later incorporated into what would, in 1839, become Belgium, the country remained intact through the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the First and Second World Wars. In 1890 the grand duchy passed to Adolf, Duke of Nassau who ruled until 1905 - he was famed for his efforts to strengthen the territory's autonomy. But, during the war, Luxembourg was occupied by German troops. The royal family fled and a government-in-exile was established in London. In 1964 Grand Duchess Charlotte abdicated in favour of her son, who becomes Grand Duke Jean. In 2000, Crown Prince Henri became Grand Duke of Luxembourg on the abdication of his father, Jean. Crown Prince Henri remains in his position today. Much of the executive power lies with the prime minister - a grand duke appointee - and his cabinet. The duchy's figurehead remains a powerful and influential figure.

For the moment, I'm enjoying spending time with my husband.'\n\nPrince Guillaume is the eldest child of Grand Duke Henri Luxembourg and his wife Grand Duchess Maria Teresa and the heir to the Luxembourg throne.\n\nHis child will follow him in the line of succession for the throne, pushing Guillaume's four siblings - Prince F\u00e9lix, Prince Louis, Princess Alexandra and Prince S\u00e9bastien - further down the list.\n\nPrince Guillaume said the birth was 'the most magical thing' as he and wife Princess St\u00e9phanie became parents for the first time (pictured together)\n\nThe couple's special news comes after a difficult 2019, which saw the passing of Guillaume\u2019s grandfather, Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg.\n\nThe Grand Duke, who died last April at the age of 98, surrounded by his family, abdicated in 2000 in favour of his son Henri.\n\nHe was a soldier in the British army during the Second World War, and participated at the D-Day landings."}}
