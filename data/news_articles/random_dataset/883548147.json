Interpol must get involved and everyone must get involved.\"\n\nIntelligence and anti-corruption bodies in Botswana alleged that Motsepe-Radebe was a co-signatory to accounts valued at billions with Botswana agent Welheminah Mphoeng Maswabi.\n\nHer lawyer Uyapo Ndadi: \u201cThe amounts involved in South Africa exceed $27 million and the amounts offshore amount to $1 billion. In fact, one charge is serious, which she\u2019s alleged to have transferred $2.95 million to finance terrorism.\"\n\nMotsepe-Radebe said she and her brother, business mogul Patrice Motsepe, were suing the newspaper that\u2019s been publishing reports about her.\n\nShe also wanted all the allegations against her investigated."}}
