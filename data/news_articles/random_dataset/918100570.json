They live in a Tampa apartment with son Sebastian, 11, who was born in Venezuela, and daughter Madison, 4, born in Tampa.\n\nTAMPA \u2014 The Paredes family had been counting the days until the end of March, when they plead their case before immigration officials for a stay of removal allowing them and their two children to remain in the United States for another year.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic delayed their annual appointment until October, buying them more time.\n\nThey\u2019re using it, in part, to help stop the spread of the virus by making homemade cloth masks for others \u2014 people, especially Spanish speakers, who may not have another of getting them.\n\nWilliams Paredes, 37, said he is answering a community need, as he did when he worked as a police officer for the city of Maracaibo, Venezuela.\n\n\u201cWe had to do our job, no matter what, to protect the community because it was our responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how me and my family turned into mask makers.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks ago, he enlisted the help of his mother-in-law, Carmen Davila, who knows how to sew.\n\n\u201cWe like to help and do something else other than watch television or eat cookies,\u201d said Davila, 57, of Tampa. \u201cAnd, here we go. Williams wanted to make sure there will be enough masks to go around.\u201d\n\nHis wife Jenniffer Infante and their two children, Sebastian, 11, and Madison, 4, joined in, and so far, the family has turned out 150 masks from their apartment home on Carlton Arms Drive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re unstoppable,\u201d Paredes said.\n\nThey\u2019ve distributed them to neighbors, friends, homeless people and those who still are working. Paredes is still running his car window-tinting business, but there are fewer customers now, and his wife, who had a part-time retail job, is out of work.\n\nSomeone heard about their mask-making and donated $300 that Paredes used to buy more yards of colorful fabric.\n\nThey know their masks aren\u2019t medical grade, but they can help. The latest advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Protection is to wear cloth face coverings where other social distancing is difficult to maintain, like grocery stores and pharmacies.\n\n\u201cSomething is something,\" Paredes said, \u201cespecially when people feel helpless during this pandemic.\"\n\n\u201cThey want to wear face masks and we\u2019ll help them.\u201d\n\nInfante, 36, said sewing face masks is a way for the family to show its gratitude to a community that has supported them.\n\nThe family obtained tourist visas and fled Venezuela for the United States in 2014 with their son. Infante said her husband received death threats in Venezuela from drug cartels for his role in a major drug bust. They applied for political asylum but were denied in 2017.\n\nMeantime, their daughter was born.\n\nA year ago, they met with representatives from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Tampa hoping to stop the deportation process. Friends, members of the Venezuelan community and human rights activists turned out to demonstrate on behalf of the family.\n\n\u201cA lot of people support us in our legal battle to get a temporary benefit and to have an opportunity, a chance, to build a new life in this great country,\u201d Infante said.\n\n\u201cOur dream came true but today we think that it is our responsibility to do something for them.\u201d\n\nTampa Bay Times coronavirus coverage\n\nJOIN THE FACEBOOK GROUP: See updates and tips posts, and ask questions of our journalists.\n\nSign up for our DayStarter newsletter\n\nToday's top headlines and information delivered to your inbox every morning.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nFind all our newsletters\n\nFOLLOW OUR COVERAGE ON SOCIAL MEDIA: Facebook.
