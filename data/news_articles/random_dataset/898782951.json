Officers were asked to recall in depth if they were able to switch off from work issues and how this affected their ability to do the job.\n\nThe findings suggested more than 70% had experienced an assault or aggression by a prisoner and over 40% reported needing to take time off work to recover from such incidents. Only a third felt \"extremely\" or \"well\" supported by their employers during this time, the research suggested.\n\nProf Kinman said: \"Officers who experienced aggressive incidents tended to have problems switching off from work. These officers were more likely to suffer from sleeping problems, including insomnia and nightmares.\n\n\"We know poor sleep can threaten the health and safety of individuals, as well as potentially comprising the wellbeing of colleagues and prisoners, through fatigue and lack of vigilance.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the MoJ said: \"We are spending an extra \u00a32.75 billion to transform our jails and enhance security to make them safer for staff and prisoners.\n\n\"We've also recruited 4,400 more prison officers over the last three years and are giving them body-worn cameras, police-style restraints and pepper spray to allow them to do their jobs more safely.\"\n\nPrison staff have access to counselling and attackers can face up to a year more behind bars, the department added."}}
