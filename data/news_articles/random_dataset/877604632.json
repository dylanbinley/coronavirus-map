After further refinement, the HRC ordinance was adopted May 1, 2018.\n\nThe nine-member commission was charged with studying and recommending programs and policies to enhance communication and understanding among all community members. It also was charged with developing and maintaining programs that build positive relations among communities and enhance problem solving skills among residents.\n\n\u201cMuch of the initial focus was centered on providing training for the commissioners to help them prepare for their work on the HRC,\u201d says Reynolds. \u201cThe early efforts of the Lansing HRC have included attendance at several community events to interact with our residents and solicit information from the community about topics/issues the HRC should look to address. They also have been working on a call for future projects.\u201d\n\nThe nine members are: Michael Bolz; David Iwaszko; Jamica Quillin; Rich Schaeffer; Micaela Smith; Darvell Stinson; Regina Titsworth; Leo Valencia, chairman; and Bobb Wright."}}
