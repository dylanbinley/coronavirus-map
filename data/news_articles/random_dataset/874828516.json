Ardern, 39, met Trump, 73, at the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, in what was the first formal meeting between the two leaders.\n\nUS President Donald Trump \u201clistened with interest\u201d about New Zealand\u2019s gun reforms introduced after the mass shooting in Christchurch, the Pacific country\u2019s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s moves on gun control have won global praise, especially in the United States, where lawmakers favouring gun control and activists have struggled to address firearms violence despite back-to-back mass shootings in Texas and Ohio last month.\n\nArdern, 39, met Trump, 73, at the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, in what was the first formal meeting between the two leaders.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the meeting, Ardern said New Zealand\u2019s gun buy-back and the process it had gone through was a big part of the 25-minute meeting, along with trade, tourism and what happened in Christchurch.\n\n\u201cIt was a conversation around our (gun) buy-back and the work we had done to remove military-style, semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles,\u201d Ardern said in videos posted by media members travelling with the prime minister.\n\n\u201cI sensed an interest,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cObviously, we were able to move very quickly and with consensus and that stood out to the world. The fact that we had that political consensus among members of parliament. \u2026 I think that sparked interest amongst others.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand had near-unanimous support in parliament when it passed a law banning military-style semi-automatics in a first round of reforms within weeks of the mass shooting in Christchurch by a suspected white supremacist, in which51 Muslim worshippers were slain.\n\nThe country launched a gun amnesty scheme. It also plans a second set of reforms, to be debated in its parliament on Tuesday.\n\nIn the United States, Trump has discussed potential gun control legislation with lawmakers after a series of mass shootings in August that killed more than 30 people. Trump has said many areas were under discussion, including background checks.\n\nArdern said she would not want to predetermine what their discussions means for the United States and the laws there, just noting that Trump \u201clistened with interest\u201d.\n\nThe meeting between the two leaders was keenly watched, as Ardern is often contrasted with Trump for her views on issues including women\u2019s rights, climate change and diversity.\n\nHowever, news media organizations were not invited to the meeting.\n\nArdern has publicly rejected Trump\u2019s view on the threat of white nationalism, and recently said she \u201ccompletely and utterly disagreed\u201d with his comments telling four minority U.S. congresswomen \u2013 three of whom were born in the United States \u2013 to go back to where they came from.\n\nArdern also gave a keynote speech at the U.N. secretary-general\u2019s Climate Action Summit.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
