Fountain, the managing director of the Netherlands-based VOICE Network, an association of advocacy groups involved with sustainable cocoa farming.\n\nFountain said that the agreement with the three companies and groups that inspect cocoa farms for violations is \u201ca big deal. Companies will generally try to deregulate instead of asking for regulations. The companies are beginning to realize that all these voluntary promises are not enough.\u201d\n\nTodd Larsen, a top official with the advocacy group Green America, said that deforestation in West Africa has accelerated in the last decade because of cocoa farming and that there has been no improvement with child labor.\n\nA 2015 U.S. Labor Department report estimated that two million children still worked in dangerous jobs in cocoa-growing regions in West Africa. A new report could be released within a few months."}}
