He said the way Pakistan government and Kashmiris were fighting Indian oppression guaranteed that Kashmir\u2019s independence was inevitable. He said Pakistan did not want war but it should not be taken as weakness.\n\nThis region could not afford war and dialogue was the only solution to resolve such issues, he said, adding the nation stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the government, Pakistan Army and Kashmiri people.\n\nProf Dr Saleem Mazhar said all the minorities were facing cruelties in India. He said Kashmir issue was not a regional issue only as it had become an international issue due to human rights violations in the Valley. He said it was astonishing that the torch-bearers of human rights, that even stress to behave with animals in a good way and do not allow chopping down trees, were silent over serious and one of its kind human rights violations in IHK.\n\nOn the premises of Government College University (GCU) Lahore, students and faculty members formed a human chain after a seminar at the University's Bukhari Auditorium to express solidarity with their brethren in IHK, support their ongoing struggle against human rights violations, and pay homage to the Kashmiri martyrs who lost their lives fighting for their freedom.\n\nGCU Vice-Chancellor Prof Dr Asghar Zaidi chaired the seminar which was also addressed by Jammu Kashmir Human Rights Commission Chairman Hamayun Zaman Mirza, Sikh Punjabi teacher Kalyan Singh, eminent writer Prof Dr Saadat Saeed and Azhar Iftikhar.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Hamayun Zaman Mirza said silence of international community over bloodshed and severe human rights violations in Kashmir was criminal; more than 10,000 women and children were still missing in the Valley and nobody knew that whether they were alive or not.\n\nProf Asghar Zaidi called upon Pakistani youths to become a voice of their Kashmiri brethren, and highlight this human issue on all platforms, including social media.\n\nDr Saadat Saeed highlighted the history of Kashmiri freedom struggle, saying that peace in the region was not possible without giving Kashmiris right of self-determination in the light of UN resolutions.\n\nKalyan Singh said minorities were safer in Pakistan than India. He said even Sikh community was being oppressed in many areas of India.
