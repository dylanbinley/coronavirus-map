During a press conference in his home, he asked for the results to be declared \"polling station by polling station\", something the electoral code did not provide for.\n\nIn Togo, the constitutional court is the highest court of the State in constitutional matters and its decisions are without appeal.\n\nThe declaration ceremony attracted members of the government, the President of the National Assembly, and the Prime Minister Selom Klassou.\n\nMr. Gnassingb\u00e9 will be sworn into office to begin his fourth term in the coming weeks."}}
