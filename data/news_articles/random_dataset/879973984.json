America's Got Talent: Kenan Thompson Joins the Judges for Live Quarterfinals -- Watch This Week's Best Acts\n\nIn this week\u2019s This Is Us, You can\u2019t swing a dead possum without hitting a Pearson family sore spot. (And in one instance, the aforementioned deceased creature is the Pearson family sore spot.)\n\nKate and Toby have a fight about a toy, but it\u2019s really about CrossFit. Kevin wants to buy Nicky a new RV, but Jack\u2019s bro wants nothing to do with his nephew\u2019s \u201cHollywood douchebag\u201d money. And on the day Beth opens her dance studio, a stinky possum carcass \u2014 as well as Randall\u2019s realization that Deja\u2019s crush has a kid of his own \u2014 threatens to derail the whole shebang.\n\nRead on for the highlights of \u201cFlip a Coin.\u201d\n\nBABY STEPS | Let\u2019s start in the past. Post-housefire, long-haired, sad-cardigan Rebecca is heading to Parents\u2019 Weekend at Randall\u2019s school, but Kate would rather watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer and snack on the couch. (Side note: Who can blame her? Those are two of my favorite activities, EVER.) Rebecca allows her to stay home and even gives her some money to buy some CDs to replace albums they lost in the blaze.\n\nAt the shop, a clerk (hi, Euphoria\u2018s Austin Abrams!) strikes up a snarkily friendly conversation with Kate, and she dishes it right back to him. Their music-flirting includes discussion of Nirvana and Death Cab for Cutie, then he offers her a job.\n\nMeanwhile, at Carnegie Mellon, Randall doesn\u2019t pay any attention at all to what Rebecca\u2019s saying at lunch \u2014 might that have something to do with the fact that Beth and her mom, Carol, are sitting across the cafeteria? When Mama Pearson realizes what\u2019s up, she embarrasses him to no end by taking her tray and asking if they can sit with the Clarke women. It\u2019s all a little awkward, but then the kids take off for class, and Carol and Rebecca bond over being recent widows.\n\nStill, Carol later tells her daughter, she doesn\u2019t think Randall is a good fit for her. \u201cRandall and his family are still very broken,\u201d she observes. \u201cYou don\u2019t need broken right now, Bethany. You need strength. You deserve it.\u201d But Beth can\u2019t stop thinking about how Randall wordlessly handed her a lemon slice during lunch, because he remembered from their date that she liked a little citrus with her Coke. So she swings by his room later that night and kisses him before sauntering outta there, leaving him (very cutely) dazed.\n\nDANCE LIKE NO ONE IS SNIFFING | In the present, Randall, Beth and the girls prep for the grand opening of Beth\u2019s studio, an event that Mama C (aka Carol) also will attend. Randall promises to run interference with his mother-in-law, who he claims has never liked him. But they have bigger problems to deal with when they arrive at the studio and it smells like something died inside. Because something did.\n\nA pest control guy tells them there\u2019s a dead possum in the walls, and there\u2019s no way to get it out without ripping down a wall. While my response to that would then be \u201cFOR THE LOVE OF GOD, GET A SLEDGEHAMMER AND GO TO TOWN, MY GOOD MAN!,\u201d I understand that may not be logistically or financially prudent at this time.\n\n\u201cWho the hell\u2019s gonna want to sign up for dances in a rat cemetery?\u201d Beth worries, prompting both Randall and Carol to step up and try to save the day. But Carol doesn\u2019t like being challenged in her savior duties, so she tries to shut down her son-in-law\u2019s plans by announcing they\u2019ll just postpone the opening. But Randall channels Lost\u2018s Locke and snips, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I can and can\u2019t do, Carol!\u201d (He immediately apologizes for the tone, but lets her know that the content of his comment stands.)\n\nIn the end, Randall succeeds in moving everything outside, and the event is a success. Carol even admits that although she didn\u2019t think Randall was right for her daughter at first, that was before she saw his strength. Yay, right? One small snag, though: Deja invites Malik to the opening to meet her folks. And though everything goes really smoothly (and dad-jokey) at first, the news that Malik has a 6-month-old at home stops Randall cold \u2014 and when she finds out, Beth is all about shutting down Deja\u2019s nascent relationship, too. As she so eloquently puts it: \u201cNo, no, no, no, no, hell no. She\u2019s 14. She\u2019s not seeing a boy who puts babies in people.\u201d\n\nCALAMITY AND CACOPHONY | Kate and Toby, who apparently are getting along with Neighbor Gregory now \u2014 take Baby Jack to a music class. But they show up late, and he\u2019s overstimulated, meaning he cries the entire time. On the way home, they snipe at each other while he continues to fuss: Kate says they would\u2019ve been on time if Toby had been able to find Jack\u2019s Monkey toy, but he didn\u2019t know where it was \u201cbecause you\u2019ve been spending all your time at the gym.\u201d He says that she should\u2019ve prepped the music teacher about their son\u2019s blindness. They drive to calm the kiddo, and wind up apologizing to each other in the process. Then they wind up at the beach, and everyone seems a little happier. (However, you\u2019ll note, neither of them address Kate\u2019s gym snipe.)\n\nMANNY NO MORE | An incorrect Alcoholics Anonymous meeting time posted on a website means that Kevin, Nicky and Cassidy \u2014 who were kicked out of their previous meeting for being giggle monsters \u2014 have five hours to kill. And Cassidy, in particular, needs a meeting and/or a distraction: Her husband wants to move ahead with their divorce. Despite his thwarted desire to buy Nicky a new trailer, Kev is doing pretty well comparatively. However, when he finds out that The Manny is getting cancelled, the news throws him a bit. (And causes him to flashback to when he shot the show\u2019s pilot, just like I asked for a few seasons back!)\n\nIn a bunch of scenes, we see a very nervous, extremely white-tank-topped Kevin on set, confiding in Kate that he\u2019s worried the potential show isn\u2019t very good. The audience isn\u2019t laughing. His infant co-star won\u2019t stop screaming. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m funny-for-a-hot-person, not actually funny,\u201d he says. At one point, he says that maybe he\u2019d be happier in a \u201csmall town somewhere. I\u2019d find a good woman. Have a couple of kids.\u201d When Kate presses him, he admits that he hopes the pilot fails. But then he\u2019s called to set and somehow the baby stops crying and starts laughing, charming the audience and cementing his chemistry with his teeny castmate, which leads to the show\u2019s ultimate success.\n\nBack in the present, Cassidy is unsympathetic that Kevin is having Big Feelings about his former sitcom. \u201cMy marriage is getting cancelled,\u201d she grouses, and Kevin comes right down to her level. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why. You\u2019re so pleasant to be around,\u201d he snarks. But then he apologizes and organizes a little field trip: Everyone\u2019s going to the RV dealer!\n\nDespite Nicky\u2019s repeated insistence that he does not want or require a new home, Kevin schmoozes with the salesman and his wife \u2014 both of whom are huge Manny fans \u2014 and Cassidy, against her will, seems almost as charmed as the couple is. She and Kevin grouse about how much divorce sucks (remember, he went through it with Sophie), and Cassidy shares the story of how her husband proposed on a bridge in Spain after she returned from a military tour. As they drive to the meeting later, it\u2019s Nicky\u2019s turn to share: He bought his current trailer for Sally, the woman he was dating when he served in Vietnam. They lost touch when he withdrew from life after coming back, but one day he bought the trailer and drove to her house\u2026 but she wasn\u2019t there and he left, never talking to her again. Um, cool.\n\nThe next day, Nicky opens his door and sees Kevin standing next to a huge, gleaming RV. He reminds his nephew once more that he doesn\u2019t want anything to change \u2014 but the vehicle\u2019s not for him. Kev is going to live there. They\u2019re neighbors!\n\nBURYING THE LEDE | In the past, Rebecca returns home from Parents\u2019 Weekend and is pleased to see that Kate has bought some of her and Jack\u2019s favorite albums, too. Rebecca talks about moving to somewhere less transient and better-lit, and it feels like a turning point for the family. The ladies are happily dancing to Carole King when there\u2019s a phone message from Kevin. At the very end, he says, \u201cOh, and I got married to Sophie. Can you send me some money?\u201d Manny says whaaaaa?\n\nNow it\u2019s your turn. What did you think of the episode? Sound off in the comments!"}}
