Representatives from Meituan Dianping and short-video platform Kuaishou were also present along with online pharmacy 1Yaowang and social commerce player Yunji.\n\nA spokesperson from JD said (in Chinese) that he was firmly against making companies pick sides, adding that JD units would not restrict them from carrying out promotional activities on other platforms.\n\nAlibaba said (in Chinese) that its exclusive partnerships are voluntary agreements, and dismissed allegations of pressure as malicious.\n\nOn the same day, a suit against Alibaba for abusing its market dominance was cleared for trial. Home appliance maker Galanz accused Tmall (in Chinese) of creating abnormalities in search results which led to a drop in sales.\n\nContext: The issue of forcing sellers to exclusively list on one online marketplace came to light in October after high-profile players sparred on social media over their respective practices."}}
