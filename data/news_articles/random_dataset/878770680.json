The National Center for Veterinary Parasitology is also housed here in the veterinary complex at [Oklahoma State].\u201d\n\nCalling the college a center \"made it difficult for peer institutions, prospective faculty, professional and graduate students to know who we are and what we do,\u201d Risco added. \u201cAll the other veterinary colleges/schools have their name, and then under that umbrella falls their teaching hospital, their diagnostic lab if they have one and their research laboratories. However, the name is 'veterinary college' or 'veterinary school,' which is easy to find when searching online.\u201d"}}
