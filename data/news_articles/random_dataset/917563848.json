His fiction thriller Target Britain is also based on Pakistani origin terrorists. Owen has spent time as BBC\u2019s foreign correspondent in Bucharest, Geneva, Islamabad, Hanoi and Beirut but he remains enamoured with Pakistan. His award-winning podcast The Assassination based on investigation into the death of Pakistan\u2019s former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, which includes interviews with those accused of her murder won him accolades.\n\nApparently, Pakistan\u2019s traditional hospitality did not rub off on Owen as he continues to display an anti-Pakistan bias. His opinion pieces appear in Pakistan\u2019s leading daily Dawn. His latest Op-Ed titled \u2018Regional Politics\u2019 which appeared on 31 March, is attempted to be an expos\u00e9 on Pakistan\u2019s alleged links with militant groups. Numerous western writers, analysts and columnists regularly bash Pakistan following the proverb \u201cGive a dog a bad name and hang him\u201d, since the theme sells.\n\nIn his article \u2018Regional Politics\u2019 the erudite writer opines that the Taliban and Haqqani Network in Afghanistan, Jaish-e-Mohammad in Kashmir and Lashkar-e-Taiba in India have all been the subject of consistent and widespread international complaint. He laments that if it wasn\u2019t for the nuclear bomb and the unfailing ability of deft Pakistani officials to confuse their foreign counterparts, the country might well have been designated a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\nPakistan may have toyed with the idea of indulging in a proxy war against India as a tit for tat solution but since it is itself bearing the brunt of terror attacks, it would not deem it befitting to play with fire\n\nNaming Pakistan\u2019s deep state\u2019s alleged proxies, he categorizes them into two groups. First Pakistani liberals who according to him, have long worried about the impact of the militants on Pakistan itself. Labelling the TTP as the army\u2019s asset, Owen believes they morphed into a heavy liability.\n\nThe learned scholar reports that the US, India, Iran and many in Afghanistan complain that Pakistan\u2019s proxy forces are sources of regional instability that exacerbate Pakistan-India tensions and destabilise Afghanistan. He stigmatizes Pakistan that it is in a state of denial regarding state sponsorship of terrorist. Owen reaches to the harsh conclusion that Pakistan no longer has plausible deniability so much as implausible deniability. He infers that military strategists in Rawalpindi might think this is no bad thing: owning militants shows that the land of the pure is also a land capable of projecting power. But it has also led to difficulties, not least in the on-off supply of American military supplies.\n\nPertinently, Owen Bennet-Jones raises the question \u201cwhy shouldn\u2019t Pakistan have proxy forces?\u201d he provides the response himself, stating \u201cAfter all, with the exception of Greenland and a few other defenceless minnows, it\u2019s common practice for states to finance and equip militant groups that fight abroad.\u201d\n\nThe author provides the example of Iran rationalizing that having suffered years of severe sanctions designed to make the country weaker, in terms of regional power politics, is currently in the strongest position it has enjoyed for decades. He enumerates Hezbollah in Iran, the Shia militias in Iraq and the Houthis in Yemen, which according to Owen, have enabled Iran not only to defend itself from attack but also put its rivals on the back foot. He concludes that the exercise has been effective for Iran.\n\nMr. Bennet-Jones infers that Iran has taken a leaf out of the book of USA and the former Soviet Union during the cold war era, when they avoided direct confrontation by getting proxy rebel movements to overthrow what were effectively proxy governments.\n\nThis scribe begs to differ with Mr. Jones\u2019 view of Pakistan\u2019s alleged support of militants to launch proxy wars in India, to weaken it or loosen its stranglehold on Kashmir; notwithstanding Pakistan supports the freedom movement in Kashmir morally as well as diplomatically. Hindsight is 20/20. Mr. Jones must have read Elias Davidsson\u2019s The Betrayal of India: Revisiting the 26/11 Evidence, which is a detailed expos\u00e9 of the Mumbai Attacks being an inside job and a false flag operation. I hope Mr. Own Bennet-Jones has taken time out to browse through this scribe\u2019s book Rising Hindutva and its Impact on the Region, in which various false flag operations choregraphed by India have been discussed in detail.\n\nTrue that like many western countries, Pakistan maintains contact with the Taliban but not to the extent of arming them or launching them for terror operations. India on the other hand was caught with its hand in the till with the arrest of its leading RAW operative, Commander Kulbhoshan Jadhav, who spilled the beans on India\u2019s heinous agenda to destabilize Pakistan, sabotage the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and wreak havoc in urban locations in Pakistan.\n\nPakistan may have toyed with the idea of indulging in a proxy war against India as a tit for tat solution but since it is itself bearing the brunt of terror attacks, it would not deem it befitting to play with fire. Keeping up with the joneses practice of clandestinely supporting militants is not Pakistan\u2019s cup of tea.\n\nThe writer is a retired Group Captain of PAF.
