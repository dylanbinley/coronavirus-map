Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said after arriving in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday that it was an \"act of war\".\n\nPresident Donald Trump said the US had \"many options\" in response.\n\n\"There is the ultimate option, and there are options a lot less than that,\" he said. \"And we'll see. We are in a very powerful position.\"\n\nWhat's in the Saudi findings?\n\nThe evidence was presented at a defence ministry press briefing, where debris from the drone (UAV) and missile attacks was laid out.\n\nDefence ministry spokesman Col Turki al-Malki said the evidence showed the attacks were launched from the north and were \u201cunquestionably sponsored by Iran\u201d.\n\nHowever, Col Malki said the Saudis were still \"working to know exactly the launch point\".\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Col Malki presented maps, photographs and video from Saturday's attacks\n\nAmong the debris was what was said to be a delta wing of an Iranian UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle).\n\nCol Malki said: \"Data recovered from the computers [on the UAV] shows it's Iranian.\"\n\nHe said that 18 UAVs had been fired at the Abqaiq oil facility and seven cruise missiles had been launched at both targets. Four cruise missiles struck the Khurais oilfield and the other three fell short of Abqaiq.\n\nCol Malki said the missiles that struck had all come from a northerly direction. He showed video of one UAV hitting Abqaiq, along with maps and photographs of the damage.\n\nHe said of the Khurais attack that the \"precision impact of the cruise missiles indicate advanced capability beyond the Iran proxy's [Houthi rebel force's] capacity\".\n\nCol Malki said details of the launch points could not yet be given, but once they had been determined they would be announced.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Saudi's UK ambassador says the oil facility attacks were \"a blow for the world\"\n\nHe said: \"Despite Iran's best efforts to make it appear so, their collaboration with their proxy in the region to create this false narrative is clear.\"\n\nHe called the attacks \"an assault on the international community\u2026 Those responsible should be held accountable for their actions\".\n\nAn essential question unanswered\n\nAnalysis by BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent, Jonathan Marcus.\n\nThe Saudi military briefing, for all its charts and assembled wreckage, had little to say about the essential question. Were the weapons used in the attacks against the Saudi oil installations actually fired from Iranian soil?\n\nAll we got was a cryptic statement that they came from the north. There were more details of the weapons themselves: some 25 in all, a mix of UAVs and cruise missiles - the latter identified as the Iranian-built Ya-Ali. Iran was implicated as being deeply involved in the whole affair but that was it. The Saudi investigations are continuing.\n\nOff the record, US officials seem already convinced of Iran's direct involvement. So what is going on here? It is the Saudis who seem to be setting the pace. Is this an attempt to give sufficient time to assemble a watertight case against Tehran? Or is this more crisis management - stringing things out in the hope that escalation can be avoided?\n\nHow has Iran responded?\n\nThere has been no official response to the briefing so far.\n\nThe Irna news agency earlier reported that Iran had sent a diplomatic note saying; \"If any action takes place against Iran, the action will be faced by Iran's answer immediately.\"\n\nReuters news agency quoted an adviser to Iran's president as saying the briefing showed Saudi Arabia \"knows nothing\" about the attacks.\n\nA spokesman for Yemen's Houthi rebels said the satellite imagery had been fabricated and that the damage to the Saudi facilities had been played down.\n\nMilitary spokesman Brig-Gen Yahya Sarea stressed again that the Houthis were behind the attacks, and detailed the type and ranges of the missiles and drones they could deploy.\n\nWhat are the next moves?\n\nAlthough the US has made it clear it believes Iran was behind the attacks, President Trump has shown himself generally reluctant to become involved in military responses.\n\nOn Wednesday he said it was \"very easy\" to get into military conflict but suggested other lessons from the Middle East proved it then became difficult.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Abqaiq was struck in the early hours of Saturday morning\n\nBefore the Saudi briefing took place, Mr Trump announced he had instructed the Treasury to \"substantially increase US sanctions\" against Iran following the attacks.\n\nMr Trump said there would be more details within 48 hours. The current sanctions are already wide-ranging, aimed at reducing Iran's oil exports and crippling its economy.\n\nMr Pompeo later met King Salman's son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to discuss strategy on the issue.\n\nUN experts have left for Saudi Arabia to carry out an inquiry into the attacks, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, warning of the \"devastating consequences\" of a major confrontation.\n\nWhat's the background to all this?\n\nAbqaiq - run by the Saudi state oil company, Aramco - and the Khurais oilfield were hit in the early hours of Saturday.\n\nThe Houthis have repeatedly launched rockets, missiles and drones at populated areas in Saudi Arabia. They are in conflict with a Saudi-led coalition which backs a president who the rebels had forced to flee when the Yemeni conflict escalated in March 2015.\n\nIran is the regional rival of Saudi Arabia and an opponent of the US, which pulled out of a treaty aimed at limiting Tehran's nuclear programme after Mr Trump took power.\n\nUS-Iran tensions have risen markedly this year.\n\nThe US said Iran was behind attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf in June and July, as well as on another four in May. Tehran rejected the accusations in both cases."}}
