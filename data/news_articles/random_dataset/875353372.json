Karnataka\u2019s new Speaker is BJP MLA Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri.\n\nComing to the defence of the disqualified Karnataka MLAs, the state Assembly Speaker on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that legislators have a \u201cdemocratic right\u201d to resign and urged the court to lay down guidelines for Speakers so that such controversies can be avoided in future.\n\nThe bench headed by Justice N V Ramana, however, wondered how it could accede to the prayer to lay down guidelines, as the Speaker is a Constitutional authority.\n\n\u201cHow can we lay down guidelines for the Speaker? He is a constitutional authority,\u201d the bench, also comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Krishna Murai, said. \u201cWe cannot encroach in his domain.\u201d\n\nThe top court was hearing petitions by the 17 disqualified Karnataka MLAs challenging the decision of then-Speaker K R Ramesh Kumar, who had refused to accept their resignations and had instead disqualified them.\n\nAppearing for the office of the Speaker, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that while legislators can be disqualified for giving up membership of a political party, they cannot be disqualified for giving up membership of the House. An MLA who does not agree with the views of his party and resigns from the membership of the House can go back to the electorate and seek a fresh mandate, Mehta said.\n\nThis, he contended, is \u201crecognition of the right to resign\u2026. Loyalty to the party is one thing, but you cannot be blindfolded by the party\u2019s whip.\u201d\n\nMehta said the Speaker only has to see whether a resignation is voluntary. While an MLA changing political parties will amount to defection, he or she resigning from membership of the House and then shifting to another party would not, he added.\n\nSenior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for some of the MLAs, said there was no rule that the disqualification ought to be decided first while the resignation was kept pending. He requested the bench to either stay the forthcoming bypolls in the state or defer them until the question is decided.\n\nAppearing for one of the MLAs, senior advocate Sajan Poovayya said his client had resigned protesting the then H D Kumaraswamy government\u2019s move to allot 3,500 acres in his constituency to a private company.\n\nMehta also urged the court to lay down guidelines for the Speaker, stating that similar issues may come up again and should be settled once and for all.\n\nKarnataka\u2019s new Speaker is BJP MLA Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
