SIGN UP HERE.\n\nPresumptive Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden delivered a speech Wednesday about reopening America amid the coronavirus pandemic, and sadly for the former vice president, the speech did little to quash the theory that he\u2019s a really \u201csleepy\u201d guy.\n\nWhat critics of the speech found particularly telling was how Biden chose to conclude it. In one of the most lethargic, low-energy closings ever in speech history, he quietly demanded President Donald Trump \u201cwake up\u201d and \u201cget to work.\u201d\n\nListen:\n\nThe end of Joe Biden\u2019s speech was uh\u2026 awkward to say the least. #PleaseClap pic.twitter.com/dp3lWJR7BQ \u2014 Abigail Marone (@abigailmarone) June 17, 2020\n\n\u201cWake up, get to work, there\u2019s so much to be done,\u201d he said excruciatingly slowly as seconds of the American people\u2019s lives ticked away.\n\nHe then allowed a couple more lengthy seconds of the American people\u2019s lives to tick away before quietly whispering, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nIt took him about 15 seconds to say 13 words, giving him a talking speed of 52 words per minute. That\u2019s 118 fewer wpm than the speaking rate employed by motivational speaker Simon Sinek during his 2009 TED Talk, \u201cHow great leaders inspire action,\u201d *cough*, according to data collated by VirtualSpeech.\n\nBelow are more comparisons:\n\nYou know who does speak as slowly as Biden? Sleepy people!\n\nWith this factoid in mind, outspoken conservative Hollywood actor James Woods decided to tweak the ending of Biden\u2019s speech to make it more fitting.\n\nWatch the hilarious end result below:\n\nThe rest of Biden\u2019s speech was just a rehash of his gripes with the president.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump thinks if he puts his head in the sand, the American people will too, but it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d he kvetched. \u201cNot when hundreds of people are still dying every day and millions are unemployed wondering how in God\u2019s name are they going to keep the lights on and food on the table.\u201d\u2018\n\n\u201cNot when workers are weighed down with worries about their safety or what happens if they get sick. There are the steps that we need to be taking now to steer us steadily and strongly in the right direction, see us through this time, to make a more resilient future. They\u2019re all available.\u201d\n\nThe evidence suggests it\u2019s Democrats like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo who\u2019ve put their heads in the sand by pretending that their policy decisions to funnel sick patients to nursing homes wasn\u2019t a big deal.\n\n\u201c[He] did the exact wrong thing with nursing homes by insisting that they treat people who have the virus,\u201d Hoover Institution research fellow David Henderson said this week during an appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Ingraham Angle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really bad when you\u2019re old and you have other comorbidities. Whereas the governor of Florida, [Ron] DeSantis, said, no, let\u2019s not do that. And we see really a big difference in deaths between Florida and New York in nursing homes.\u201d\n\nIndeed. Yet according to Democrats and their media allies, DeSantis is the screw-up, while Cuomo is a hero equivalent to Jesus Christ. And that\u2019s why the media have continued attacking DeSantis while letting Cuomo completely off the hook:\n\n@NYGovCuomo has deleted his march 25 th order requiring nursing homes to take #coronavirus positive patients. Wait. He says he did nothing wrong. So why try to cover up his mistakes? It\u2019s hard to delete a disaster that big from history governor \u2014 George E. Pataki (@GovernorPataki) May 22, 2020\n\nI\u2019d love for a reporter to ask why @NYGovCuomo deleted his March 25th order to force nursing homes to admit recovering #coronavirus patients. Why the coverup? https://t.co/7qeR4e8hHF \u2014 Janice Dean (@JaniceDean) May 26, 2020\n\nStill waiting for ANY reporter to ask @NYGovCuomo about this *missing* March 25th order forcing recovering Covid patients into nursing homes. https://t.co/tzsIA1N2Xs \u2014 Janice Dean (@JaniceDean) May 26, 2020\n\nDuring Biden\u2019s speech, he also tried to rewrite history.\n\n\u201cFor weeks in January and February, but I wasn\u2019t alone, I was raising my concerns about how we need to take this virus seriously, all while Trump was ignoring the reporting from his own intelligence community in his daily briefings, and the warnings of his closest advisors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll the while praising the Chinese government for being transparent in handling this virus instead of demanding access for the CDC that Beijing was refusing to give in Wuhan. The American people have sacrificed so much to fight this virus. We\u2019ve lost lives, we\u2019ve lost businesses, we\u2019ve lost paychecks, and now thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s bungling, we may lose some of the progress we begun to make.\u201d\n\nIn reality, it was the Democrats who first denied that the coronavirus was a threat and then turned around and became the loudest proponents of the devastating, unproductive lockdowns that have destroyed businesses and lives.\n\nAnd to this day, it\u2019s the Democrats who are the most hellbent on preventing American life from returning to normal, even as they champion the interests of \u201cprotesters,\u201d looters and riots.\n\nListen to Biden\u2019s whole speech below:"}}
