Mark Gordon said he was doing his best to avoid similar measures here as the total number of coronavirus patients in the Equality State rose by more than 70 percent in roughly 24 hours.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to avoid that order,\u201d he told media during a press conference Wednesday. \u201cBut we do have the tools to be able to issue that kind of order. But as I said, we are trying to avoid that order because of the complexities it involves.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do have means to enforce it, either through law enforcement or other means,\u201d he added. Even without the order, he urged Wyomingites to stay at home as much as possible. Health officials across the country have said that a sound way to slow this virus \u2014 as any other \u2014 is to maintain social distancing.\n\nGordon\u2019s press conference comes as Wyoming continues to experience its largest surge of new COVID-19 cases. As of late Thursday afternoon, there are now 49 confirmed cases in Wyoming, with 21 identified in roughly the past 24 hours. Nationally, there are more than 63,700 known cases, according to the New York Times. More than 900 people have died. Both of those numbers have jumped in the hours since this article was first updated. They will continue to grow."}}
