Sequim Ave., are $15 and are available by calling the theater at 360-683-7326. At the time of writing, tickets were not available on OTA\u2019s website.\n\nDePrez, whom peers call a \u201cpioneer\u201d of the comedy scene in Portland in the 1980s, was diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) in 2002.\n\nBecause of his condition, more commonly known in the U.S. as \u201cchronic fatigue syndrome,\u201d he has been disabled since then.\n\n\u201cCalling it chronic fatigue syndrome doesn\u2019t really describe it well enough,\u201d DePrez said. \u201cIt\u2019s like calling diabetes \u2018chronically needing to drink a lot.\u2019 There\u2019s so much more to it than that.\u201d\n\nBecause of his condition, DePrez said that most days he can only be active and working for a few hours in total. On days like his performance, or when he\u2019s been on stage at OTA for \u201cFirst Date\u201d and \u201cLeaving Iowa\u201d in the last two years, he typically does little before heading to the theater.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that or I don\u2019t have the energy to get through the show,\u201d DePrez said.\n\nSequim\u2019s climate, with lots of sun and relatively low humidity, is a big help in dealing with his condition.\n\n\u201cSevere headaches and joint pain are a major, debilitating part of ME,\u201d DePrez said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m here I hardly have to deal with that.\u201d\n\nParts of his show will be about dealing with myalgic encephalomyelitis, according to DePrez, but the full show will touch on numerous topics.\n\nBecause of some of the content, the show is recommended for mature audiences only, OTA officials say.\n\nStage hopeful\n\nAccording to DePrez, his big ambition in high school was to become an actor and playwright. He was drawn to comedy when he realized that he could combine both fields into one in a way that he found satisfying.\n\nThe show also marks the 40th anniversary of his first stand-up comedy show in 1979.\n\nDePrez has only had limited on stage experience since his diagnosis in 2002 thanks in part to his condition, but also due to other life factors like spending close to 10 years serving as the primary caretaker for his mother when she was ill.\n\nHe put on a show in Portland in 2017, but admitted his timing for it could have been better.\n\n\u201cI should have been paying better attention to the news,\u201d DePrez said, laughing. \u201cOtherwise it wouldn\u2019t have been at the same time as the total solar eclipse!\u201d\n\nAs a writer, DePrez has sold articles to magazines ranging from the Christian Science Monitor to Playboy and is the author of the recovery humor book \u201c31 Days At A Time: Daily Meditations For The Serenity-Impaired.\u201d His song \u201cSingles Chanty\u201d was featured on the \u201cDr. Demento Show\u201d and he has opened for musicians such as Taj Mahal and Dr. John.\n\nOn Oct. 19, DePrez will be heading to Seattle to perform at the Aurora Borealis as part of the Comic Aid benefit show to support Seattle comedian Rod Long, who DePrez describes as \u201ca dear friend\u201d and who is dealing with pancreatic cancer."}}
