Even now, South Africa is debating an amendment to permit the expropriation of private property without compensation. That would be disastrous for that economy, and the South African people,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHe added: \u201cSocialist schemes haven\u2019t economically liberated this continent\u2019s poorest.\u201d\n\n\u201cA strong rule of law, respect for property rights, regulation that encourages investment, women\u2019s full participation, governments that respect their people \u2013 these are the key ingredients for true, inclusive, sustainable economic liberation,\u201d he said.\n\nSeeking ways of repositioning U.S. economic interests in Africa against the already entrenched position of China seems to be one of the reasons of Pompeo\u2019s three-country African tour, according to some observers.\n\nEthiopia was the last-leg of his visit after his trips to Angola and Senegal.\n\n\u201cThe Asian tigers lifted themselves up in the span of a few decades, because they liberalized and opened to trade,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat can happen here too \u2013 and indeed it must. More than 60% of the population in Africa is under the age of 25. Only nations hospitable to the private sector will stimulate the growth that delivers jobs and prosperity on the scale the continent needs.\n\n\u201cAnd to African leaders today \u2013 future generations are depending on those stable, corruption-free environments that attract foreign investment,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\n"}}
