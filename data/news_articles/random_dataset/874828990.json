Mitt Romney after the Utah Republican continued his call for the release of more information about Trump's July call with Ukraine's president where he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe video included a compilation of news clips from Romney's 2012 general election loss to Barack Obama paired with clips of Trump's own 2016 presidential election win over Hillary Clinton.\n\nEarlier Monday, Romney told reporters he believes a transcript of the President's conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, should be released. \"Understanding exactly what he said would be very helpful I think to determine whether the allegations, which are quite serious, are allegations that will have consequence,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday, CNN reported Trump pressed Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.\n\nTrump on Sunday acknowledged that he discussed Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper, including that he threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine unless the country's leaders did his bidding and investigated the Bidens.\n\nRead More"}}
