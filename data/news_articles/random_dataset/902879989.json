By the end of the first week of January, health authorities had confirmed that the virus was a novel coronavirus.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen coronavirus outbreaks before \u2013 think of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). This latest coronavirus began infecting more people in Hubei, before spreading to other parts of China. The Chinese New Year complicating things, as there were huge amounts of people travelling within and to and from China.\n\nThailand, Japan, the US, Germany and now England have all confirmed coronavirus cases. Last night, coronavirus was declared a global emergency by the World Health Organisation.\n\nA number of Irish people are currently on an evacuation flight out of China.\n\nOn this week\u2019s podcast, we answer the question of how worried we should be about the coronavirus in Ireland. How does a virus work? What exactly is a coronavirus? How does it spread? And is Ireland prepared?\n\nTo help answer these questions, joining Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Carroll in studio are Nigel Stevenson, associate professor in immunology at Trinity College Dublin, and Noteworthy investigative journalist Maria Delaney. We also speak to John Cuddihy, Director of the HSE\u2019s Health Protection Surveillance Centre, about how the Irish health system is dealing with the coronavirus threat.\n\nSource: The Explainer/SoundCloud\n\nThis episode was put together by presenter Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Carroll, producer Aoife Barry, assistant producer and technical operator Nicky Ryan, and executive producer Christine Bohan.
