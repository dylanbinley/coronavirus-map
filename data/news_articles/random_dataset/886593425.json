He was deported to the US on Thursday.\n\n\u201cNecessary procedures have been launched to send the foreign terrorist fighter stuck in the buffer zone to the US, upon a US commitment,\u201d Turkey\u2019s state-funded Anadolu news agency reported.\n\nThe wave of deportations comes after a White House meeting on Wednesday between Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Mr Trump, who has hectored European leaders for failing to take back nationals who joined Isis in recent years.\n\nLisa Smith, an Irish woman who allegedly joined Isis, and her two-year-old daughter, are set to be deported to Ireland.\n\nTurkey says it has captured about 1,200 foreign nationals suspected of having links to Isis.\n\nBoth Turkey and the US have complained about Europe\u2019s reluctance to take back their nationals.\n\n\u201cWe will continue sending them, so if they take them or do not take them doesn\u2019t really concern us,\u201d Mr Erdogan said on Tuesday before leaving for the US.\n\nEuropean officials have insisted that Isis suspects should be tried in Syria and Iraq."}}
