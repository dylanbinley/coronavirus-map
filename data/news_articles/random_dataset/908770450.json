We will be poorer, they richer \u2014 Andrew Adonis (@Andrew_Adonis) February 27, 2020\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling is the first in the world to be based on the Paris agreement and may trigger challenges against other major infrastructure projects in the UK and abroad.\n\nIn its ruling the court stressed that it had not decided whether or not Heathrow\u2019s expansion should go ahead but merely ruled that the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS), which approved the project in its current form was unlawful.\n\nIt said that failure to consider the Paris agreement had been \u201clegally fatal\u201d to the ANPS.\n\nThe ruling said: \u201cWe have not decided, and could not decide, that there will be no third runway at Heathrow. We have not found that a national policy statement supporting this project is necessarily incompatible with the United Kingdom\u2019s commitment to reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change under the Paris Agreement, or with any other policy the government may adopt or international obligation it may undertake.\n\n\u201cThe consequence of our decision is that the government will now have the opportunity to reconsider the ANPS in accordance with the clear statutory requirements that parliament has imposed.\u201d\n\nBREAKING: We won! Today we blocked the Tory government plans to build a third runway at Heathrow Airport.\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s judgment is a major victory for all Londoners who are passionate about tackling the climate emergency and cleaning up our air. https://t.co/59MEn2X6Lw \u2014 Sadiq Khan (@SadiqKhan) February 27, 2020\n\nThe challenges were dismissed in the High Court in May last year but the complainants took their cases to the Court of Appeal.\n\nEnvironmental group Friends of the Earth, represented by law firm Leigh Day, brought one of the legal challenges, focusing on the climate change impact of a third runway.\n\nThe group argued that the government\u2019s decision to allow expansion was unlawful as it failed to explain how it fitted in with the UK\u2019s climate change policy.\n\nIt also claimed that the decision breached the Department for Transport\u2019s sustainable development duties in failing to consider mitigating climate change for future generations."}}
