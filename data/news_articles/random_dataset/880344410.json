I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d run around toting it as a major political issue.\u201d\n\nMr Bothwell said you would have to go back more than 100 years to find an American president intervening in a Canadian federal election.\n\nHe said the former US president Theodore Roosevelt, who was president from 1901 to 1909, visited Toronto in 1917 when Canada was having an election about conscription and spoke in favour of it. But Mr Bothwell said he didn\u2019t know how explicit he was.\n\nNelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, called Mr Obama\u2019s endorsement rare and said it possibly has not happened before but he does not think it will move the polls.\n\n\u201cIn fact, some people may feel this is an unwarranted foreign intrusion in Canada\u2019s election,\u201d he said.\n\nDaily coronavirus briefing No hype, just the advice and analysis you need Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Mr Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party posted Mr Obama\u2019s message into a party fundraising pitch that was emailed directly to potential donors\n\nThe Canadian prime minister\u2019s rival, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, said that he is \u201cnot very interested what former foreign leaders are saying\u201d.\n\nHe said he would let Canadians judge whether Mr Obama\u2019s endorsement is appropriate.\n\nAssociated Press"}}
