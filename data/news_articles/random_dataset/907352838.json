The Islamic Republic\u2019s founder Ruhollah Khomeini frequently mentioned valued terms such as \u201cfreedom,\u201d \u201creferendum,\u201d \u201cparliament,\u201d \u201cconstituent assembly,\u201d \u201crepublic,\u201d \u201cimpoverished people,\u201d etc. before the 1979 revolution.\n\nHowever, after seizing power, he immediately used the abovementioned terms to implement his outdated mindset and establish a tyrannical rule.\n\nThe concepts of elections, people, and democracy were also exposed to more permuting by Khomeini and his subordinate mullahs. These terms are widely mentioned during election campaigns to deceive the people and fool the regime\u2019s international counterparts who prefer to close their eyes to the regime\u2019s crimes and the crackdown on Iranian citizens rather than stand along with Iranians for their rightful demands.\n\nThe word \u201cdemocracy\u201d refers to a system that is elected by \u201cdemo\u201d [\u201cpeople\u201d in Latin] and according to their will and determination. Today, most states in the world have adopted this culture. However, contrary to the ayatollahs\u2019 claims, democracy is just dark humor in Iran. In this context, the ayatollahs loyal to Khomeini invented the new term \u201creligious democracy.\u201d They pursue to style themselves as modern rulers, while they insist on their outdated conceptions.\n\n\u201cThe people are our benefactors,\u201d Khomeini claimed. However, a little later, he described the people as a flock of sheep who need a shepherd, and there is no shepherd except the \u201cVali-e Faqih\u201d [the supreme leader]. \u201cIf all the people say yes, but the Vali [-e faqih] says no, the order of [the supreme leader] should be implemented,\u201d Khomeini explained the length of the power of Vali-e faqih. Therefore, the sole decision-maker and voter in Iran is the supreme leader. This is what the mullahs mean by \u201creligious democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot four million people, but if forty million voted for [someone]; [the question is] do the people\u2019s votes have any value if the vali-e faqih didn\u2019t validate, or not do? All these votes are likely thousands or millions of zeros. When the [number] one came it would find meaning. If the Vali-e faqih didn\u2019t validate\u2026 the votes of the people are worthless,\u201d Mohammad Hosseini Qazvini said in May 2018.\n\nOn the other hand, Khomeini institutionalized an assembly called the Guardian Council that genuinely put the seal on any elections and voting in Iran. He appointed six of his loyalist mullahs and six staunch jurists to determine who is qualified to run for elections. They also specified the wholehearted and practical belief to the Velayat-e faqih as the main condition for being qualified. Plainly, no one without direct or indirect supervision of the supreme leader can run for elections, let alone being elected and taking a position.\n\n\u201c[The Guardian Council] pursues to monopolize the [next] parliament [Majles] with wide disqualification\u2026 A single-voice Majles is not a parliament, it\u2019s a military base,\u201d former vice president for legal affairs Majid Ansari tweeted on February 15.\n\nIn response, on the same day, Khamenei\u2019s representative in Mashhad, Ahmad Alamolhoda, named the council as the \u201chero guard of democracy\u201d for the country, which prevents influential elements of the enemy from entering the Majles. Alamolhoda also added, \u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t vote certainly goes to hell.\u201d\n\nHowever, in recent months, the Iranian people opened the doors of hell for the ayatollahs in nationwide protests in November and January. Protesting people bravely flooded into the streets and demanded the end of the religious dictatorship. They chanted slogans, \u201cDeath to Khamenei,\u201d \u201cDeath to Rouhani,\u201d \u201cDeath to the tyrant, be he the monarch or supreme leader,\u201d \u201cThe Revolutionary Guards [IRGC], you are our murderers.\u201d The outraged people also trampled and torched the icons of Khomeini, Khamenei, and the slain commander of the IRGC\u2019s Quds Force Qassem Soleimani.\n\nIn other words, they cast their true vote for regime change and left the oppressive regime on the brink of collapse. However, the ayatollahs are scrambling to gain legitimacy while the November and January protests have extremely shaken their pillars and have put a free and democratic Iran on the horizon.\n\nRead more:\n\nMEK: Iran\u2019s Election Sham Is the Latest Crisis for the Regime"}}
