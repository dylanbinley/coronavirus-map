While the resolution of those disputes is uncertain, a big piece of American business has just landed in China \u2013 with an enthusiastic reception.\n\nCostco has arrived in China.\n\nThousands of people packed a store in suburban Shanghai Tuesday \u2013 so many that it had to close early. Agence France Presse reports drivers were complaining about waiting three hours just to get into the parking lot.\n\nCostco has had an online presence in China for about five years, but this is the first warehouse style store so familiar to many Americans.\n\nForeign retailers generally have had a mixed record in China. Grocery store chains from the U.K., Spain and France have all tried the China market, and they have all pulled out \u2014 selling ownership stakes to local companies.\n\nThe German supermarket chain Aldi started opening stores in the country just a few months ago.\n\nWalmart is still growing in China \u2014 especially its Sam\u2019s Club membership store model, similar to Costco\u2019s approach. In May, Walmart announced it plans to open additional stores in Beijing as part of a broader China expansion.\n\nCostco has been less specific with its future plans, but opening day was definitely a hit.\n\nThe South China Morning Post reports popular items included liquor, handbags and shoes \u2014 others say demand was high for fresh-baked food items.\n\nReuters says a local government-run media outlet sent out a note advising, quote, \u201cfor the safety of the public, we urge that residents consume in a rational manner and choose to go shopping at an off-peak time.\u201d"}}
