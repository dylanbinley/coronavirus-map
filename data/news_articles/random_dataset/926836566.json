Who wants these loans? They may also become non-performing loans if lent out. Now, as some migrant workers still have not returned to work, fiscal policy should be more forceful in protecting people\u2019s livelihood,\u201d Cai said.\n\n\u201cAnd when employment improves, demand recovers and companies start to invest again, monetary policy will need to play a bigger role,\u201d he said. \u2014 Reuters"}}
