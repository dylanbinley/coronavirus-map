They watched as friends packed their belongings within hours and hit the road the following day. Then they started planning their own drive home.\n\nIt took them about three days to get to upstate New York. Hours into their drive, one of the camper\u2019s wheels came off, which forced them to stop in Virginia for a \u201cBand-Aid fix,\u201d Ms. Lauster said. The following day, after driving for about 11 hours, they made it to Clyde a little after midnight. They plan to remain under self-quarantine for two weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was a relief to be home,\u201d Ms. Lauster said. \u201cThere\u2019s no longer the pressure of what happens if they close roads, if they close gas stations?\u201d\n\nIn Texas, another popular state for snowbirds (though they are called winter Texans there), private campgrounds remain open and largely full, said Brian Schaeffer, the executive director and chief executive of the Texas Association of Campground Owners. His 400 members, made up of private campgrounds and R.V. parks, have only seen about a five percent decline in reservations and will continue to operate as essential businesses. The majority of the parks\u2019 visitors usually stay for an entire season.\n\nMr. Schaeffer said he thought it was better for visitors to shelter in place in South Texas. \u201cBetter to do that than risk traveling through multiple states to get back home. Once things settle down, then you can go back.\u201d"}}
