The second agent to arrive used a Taser to subdue Rodriguez.\n\nIn imposing a sentence Monday, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel said \u201cfew other law enforcement officers place their life on the line to the extent that Border Patrol agents do.\u201d\n\nHe handed down an 11-year, nine-month sentence for the two counts, plus an additional two years for a violation of the terms of a supervised release, which stemmed from a 2014 conviction for illegal re-entry.\n\nProsecutors previously said Rodriguez-Chavez had been deported from the U.S. on five occasions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis sentence is a fitting reminder that the safety of our courageous agents, who put their lives on the line every day to protect our country, is of paramount importance to our office and to the community,\u201d U.S. Attorney Robert Brewer said in a statement.\n\nSan Diego\u2019s new Border Patrol chief, Aaron Heitke, shared a similar sentiment.\n\n\u201cBorder Patrol agents risk their lives every day protecting America, and the agent\u2019s quick thinking in this case prevented any bloodshed,\u201d Heitke said."}}
