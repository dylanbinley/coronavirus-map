People who lobbied for HPPs [Hydroelectric power plants] in the region, with the government and the police at their backs, killed a man who was against constructing HPPs. The people openly lobbying this issue in the region are the Kavtarashvilis and Pareulidzes\u2019, Mutoshvili said.\n\nShe added that the conflict started \u20181-2 months ago\u2019.\n\nFollowing the deadly shootout, Khaso Khangoshvili, the head of the Council of Elders \u2014 a traditional ruling body in the valley \u2014 denied it was related to hydropower plants. He said it originated from a conflict between two young people three months ago.\n\nThe Interior Ministry has launched an investigation for \u2018premeditated murder\u2019.\n\nControversial plants\n\nTwo planned hydropower projects in Pankisi Valley, Khadori 3 and Samkuristskali 2, have been a source of controversy between the government and many local residents.\n\nThe sudden resumption of construction on Khadori 3 in the village of Birkiani in April triggered a protest, resulting in clashes between a group of local activists and riot police.\n\n[Read more on OC Media: Georgian riot police deploy rubber bullets and tear gas in Pankisi hydropower protest]\n\nGeorgian Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia, then the Interior Minister, met a wave of criticism for using special police forces to secure the \u2018safety of construction workers\u2019. Despite Gakharia\u2019s vow to do so, no one was prosecuted for attacking riot police officers.\n\nGeorgian rights group the Human Rights Education and Monitoring Centre (EMC) has mounted multiple legal challenges to halt construction of Khadori 3 and Samkuristskali 2. The cases are pending.\n\nRepresenting local residents opposed to Khadori 3, EMC argued that Akhmeta Municipality had issued a construction permit for the dam based on an incomplete Environmental Impact Assessment report by Georgia\u2019s Environmental Protection Ministry.\n\nIn a later report on government policies in Pankisi, EMC described the government\u2019s infrastructural projects there as failing to involve or employ local residents. They also criticised the authorities for approaching the region only \u2018from a security angle\u2019.\n\nMany residents of Pankisi Valley, which is populated mainly by ethnic Kists, have maintained that they never consented to the latest HHP projects in their region. However, resistance to the projects has not been unanimous and has been a source of friction among the local population.\n\nIn early November, Khaso Khangoshvili claimed that following the incident in April over Khadori 3, the government had halted planned investments in the region."}}
