But there is no offer to Muslims.\n\nIslamic groups, the opposition and others fear this forms part of a Modi plan to marginalize India's 200 million Muslims and remould the country as a Hindu nation.\n\nAuthorities have imposed emergency laws and blocked internet access in a bid to contain the unrest. At least 7,500 people have been detained or arrested for rioting, according to state officials, with 5,000 in Uttar Pradesh state alone where 17 people have been killed.\n\nTwo people were shot dead in Karnataka state and six died in Assam in the northeast last week.\n\nIn Assam, opponents fear the law will enable large numbers of Bengali-speaking immigrants to settle there. Elsewhere, opponents say the law makes religion a test for citizenship ahead of a nationwide register Modi wants by 2024 to remove \"infiltrators.\""}}
