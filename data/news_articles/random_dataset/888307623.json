REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo\n\nThe share sale, via a Gazprom subsidiary, was completed at an 11% discount to company\u2019s closing market price on Wednesday. Gazprom raised $2.2 billion in July through a similar deal, selling 2.9% of its shares at a 5% discount.\n\nGazprom said the latest deal involved about 3.6% of so-called quasi-treasury shares, built up in several purchases over previous years, being sold at 220.72 rubles each, implying proceeds of 187.7 billion rubles ($2.95 billion).\n\nAlthough Gazprom does not have to disclose the names of the buyers as both deals were below 5%, data from the Moscow Stock Exchange showed that there was only one buyer in the latest.\n\nGazprom did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\n\u201cThe most important takeaway from both placements is that new shareholders with a total 6.5% stake have appeared in the shareholder structure,\u201d Sberbank CIB said in a note.\n\n\u201cIt is not certain whether these new investors are strategic, though an overall investment of $5.1 billion suggests that most likely they are,\u201d it added.\n\nGazprom is headed by Alexei Miller, a long-standing ally of President Vladimir Putin, who said this week that the company would stick to its policy of raising dividends as it responds to \u201cchallenges\u201d in the global energy industry.\n\nOn Thursday, Gazprom said it had received 479 bids worth a total of 237.7 billion rubles.\n\n\u201cIt seems that low participation had an impact on the placement pricing,\u201d Sberbank said.\n\nThe sale of treasury shares is positive for Gazprom in the mid-term due to the growth of its free float and a potential increase of its share in indexes, said Mikhail Poddubsky, an analyst at Promsvyazbank.\n\nShares in Gazprom were steady on Friday after rising the previous day when the deal was announced."}}
