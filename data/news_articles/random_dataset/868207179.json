Ilhan Omar From the House", "TEXT": "\n\n\n\nAt least one Alabama Republican has seen and heard enough from noted anti-Semite Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar. On Saturday, Alabama State Rep. Tommy Hanes (R-Bryant) called on the state\u2019s congressional delegation to move forward with a bill that would expel Omar from the House of Representatives.\n\nAccording to Alabama\u2019s Yellowhammer News, Hanes made the proposal at the ALGOP\u2019s summer meeting in Lee County. That was where gathered Republicans took up Hanes\u2019 proposal and officially passed a resolution calling for Omar\u2019s ousting.\n\nAt one point, Hanes took to the floor to argue the case.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just simply asking this body to ask the U.S. delegation, the Alabama delegation in Washington, D.C. to start proceedings to unseat Ilhan Omar, congresswoman from Minnesota,\u201d Hanes said. \u201cThis woman is continuously spewing anti-American rhetoric, anti-Semitism. She is un-American. She came from a war-torn country in Somalia to seek protection under Lady Liberty\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cFolks, she constantly talks about the U.S. military \u2013 I put the U.S. military here,\u201d he continued, lifting his arm. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the U.S. military, we wouldn\u2019t be here today. I put them here, and she continuously talks down on our veterans. Folks, she continuously talks about one of our most faithful and loyal allies, which is Israel. Let Alabama be first and let\u2019s see how many other states follow.\u201d\n\nHayes and the state GOP will certainly have a sympathetic ear from U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL), who said in a radio show this week that the increase in anti-Semitism from the Democratic Party was a direct result of electing Muslims to the House.\n\n\u201cKeep in mind, Muslims more so than most people have great animosity towards Israel and the Jewish faith,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cAnd as you have more and more Muslims in the United States, as they gain greater and greater influence in elections, particularly in Democratic Party primaries \u2014 then you\u2019re going to see more and more people like Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and company that are anti-Israel, and that brings an entirely different viewpoint into the United States Congress.\u201d\n\nBrooks\u2019 comments drew condemnation from Omar, who tweeted: \u201cOh it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s just a Republican who says something bigoted! Also, if they are losing their minds over three Muslims in a body of 535, wonder what happens when there is 20 or more????\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s praying that we never find out.\n\n\n\n"}}
