She said she had to rush the child to another unit in the hospital for help and that he was brought back to life by staff in the trauma ward. Samantha Moodley, 38, of Phoenix, said she had to run down the passage in Life Mount Edgecombe Hospital to the trauma unit with her 10-week-old toddler\u2019s lifeless body. She said her son, Zachariah Naidu, regained consciousness after a third attempt to revive him. Moodley, a food manager, has since lodged a complaint with the hospital\u2019s management over alleged staff negligence.\n\n\u201cI have decided to speak out because I don\u2019t want another parent to go through what I have\u201d said Moodley.\n\nDetailing the events, she said Zachariah was born on November 8, at the Life Mount Edgecombe Hospital.\n\nAfter they were discharged, she noticed he had difficulty breathing.\n\nDuring a check-up a week later at the Life Mount Edgecombe, she said she notified the doctor.\n\nShe allegedly told her there was nothing to panic about. But the newborn\u2019s breathing, she said, worsened.\n\n\u201cHe made loud sounds when he inhaled and exhaled. We thought he could be asthmatic.\u201d\n\nAt his 10-week check-up, she took him to a clinic in Phoenix where a nurse noted his abnormal breathing.\n\n\u201cShe advised me to take him to the hospital for a proper examination.\u201d\n\nBut Moodley said a doctor at Life Mount Edgcombe\u2019s trauma unit told her he was not asthmatic.\n\n\u201cI wanted a second opinion and I was referred to a paediatric lung specialist at the hospital. She told me Zachariah had to be admitted for a complete medical check.\u201d\n\nHer son was admitted on January 24.\n\n\u201cHis blood results and X-rays were clear. But the doctor said my son would need to undergo a CT scan on January 27.\u201d\n\nThe scan provides more detailed information than an X-ray.\n\nShe said a nurse advised her that she would be present during the procedure.\n\n\u201cI signed a consent form. But on the day of the CT scan, the nurse was not there. The porter took us to a room where two staff greeted us.\n\n\u201cThey asked me to hold Zachariah\u2019s arms above his head, so the scan could be done. But while doing this, the women left. They went into an adjacent room and I could see them speaking.\u201d\n\nMoodley said her son began gasping for air.\n\n\u201cI shouted for help but no one heard me. My son\u2019s head fell to the side, he stopped breathing and bled from the nose and mouth. I banged at the door the women were in. I tried to open the door but it was locked. They eventually opened the door and told me to go to the trauma unit.\u201d\n\nShe said a radiology manager took her son from her to the trauma unit.\n\n\u201cZachariah was not breathing for a . I cried out to Jesus to please save my son. I was so scared. I knew his life was in God\u2019s hands and all I could do was pray.\u201d\n\nMoodley said her child was resuscitated through a process called bagging - where a balloon is used to pump air into the lungs. She said on the third attempt, he regained consciousness.\n\n\u201cHe was then taken to the Intensive Care Unit at Ethekwini Heart Hospital. The doctors said he was born with weak muscles around the lungs and would develop as he got older.\u201d\n\nMoodley said she was told the procedure, of placing his hands above his head, caused his airways to collapse and prevented oxygen to the heart. He spent a week in hospital.\n\n\u201cIf I did not react quickly enough, I believe my son would have died.\u201d\n\nFollowing a response from the hospital on allegations of negligence, Moodley said: \u201cThey are making me out to look like I didn\u2019t follow the proper procedures which is not true.\u201d\n\nShe has since met with the hospital to discuss the matter further.\n\nCharles Naidu, Zachariah\u2019s father, said. \u201cI feel that if my wife had not been an alert and quick thinking mother we would have lost our baby.\n\n\u201cI will not want any other family to go through the trauma that we experienced and I have lost faith in the hospital and its partners,\u201d he said.\n\nStacey Naidoo, the manager at Life Mount Edgecombe, said the hospital was aware of the incident in the radiology unit.\n\nShe said the unit was an independent practice that employed experienced and qualified radiographers.\n\nNaidoo said the practice investigated the complaint and advised that its standard practice was for a parent to accompany a minor into the CT scan room as long as the child was stable and not on an oxygen apparatus.\n\n\u201cThe parent may stay in the room during the scan as an emotional and physical comfort for the child.\n\n\u201cA nurse is present only if the patient is unstable, to which our nursing records reflect that the patient was stable. Radiographers in the unit are all trained in basic life support for health-care workers.\u201d\n\nNaidoo said the CT room was equipped with a speaker to allow those in the room to communicate with the radiographer.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm that the patient was stable and no nursing staff member accompanied the patient or the parent into the CT scan room. We can also confirm that the mother remained in the room during the scan and followed the radiographer\u2019s instructions but did not make use of the speaker to call for help.\u201d\n\nShe said the radiographer noted that Moodley picked up the baby from the table during the scan.\n\n\u201cThe radiographer then enquired to the reason for this, to which the mother replied that the baby was not breathing. The radiographer immediately followed the standard process by activating the panic alarm.\n\n\u201cThe appointed health and safety representative in the unit, also a radiographer, responded according to standard procedures and immediately rushed the patient to the hospital\u2018s emergency unit.\u201d\n\nShe said the patient received the necessary treatment by the emergency doctor and nurses, and responded immediately to the treatment.\n\n\u201cBoth the radiology unit and Life Healthcare is pleased that the patient responded well to treatment on the day.\n\n\u201cUpon investigation into the matter, Life Mount Edgecombe Hospital believes that the radiology unit acted appropriately and all staff acted within their scope of practice.\u201d\n\nPOST"}}
