Casualties were reported in those clashes.\n\nThe Iraqi Interior and Health Ministries have said in statements that they regretted the violence which they blamed on \u201ca group of rioters\u201d who had infiltrated the protests.\n\nProminent Iraqi Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr has also called for an investigation into the clashes.\n\nIraq is recovering from three years of war with the foreign-backed Daesh terrorist group. It has also been dealing with years of internal power clashes as well as the US military invasion and occupation of the country."}}
