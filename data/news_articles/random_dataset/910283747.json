CANCELLED", "TEXT": "Atlanta indie rockers, Algiers, return to Club Congress with support from Zen Mother and Sur Block.\n\nFormed in London in 2012 by Fisher, Mahan and Tesche, friends from Atlanta who had been playing music together since childhood, the band recruited drummer Matt Tong (ex-Bloc Party) and signed to Matador in 2014. Since, they have toured relentlessly worldwide and released two massively acclaimed albums, 2015\u2019s self titled and their breakthrough 2017 sophomore LP The Underside of Power.\n\nTheir new album, There Is No Year, was recorded over the past year by childhood friends and Atlanta natives Franklin James Fisher, Ryan Mahan and Lee Tesche, as well as drummer Matt Tong, in New York alongside producers Randall Dunn [Sunn O))), Earth] and Ben Greenberg [Zs, Uniform (as featured on Twin Peaks season 3)]. There Is No Year is titled for author Blake Butler\u2019s novel of the same name, a major inspiration to the band over the course of the album\u2019s making."}}
