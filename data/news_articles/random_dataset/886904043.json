Akel, a former Malaysian rock star, was killed in an airstrike in northeastern Syria in March 2019, Malaysia\u2019s counterterrorism chief told BenarNews last week.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith this I sentence you to three years in jail, the date of sentence to commence from the date of arrest,\u201d Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah ruled.\n\nThe channeling of funds for terrorist activities was a serious offense under Malaysian law, said Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay, the chief of Malaysia\u2019s counterterrorist police branch, who had divulged the information about Akel\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cIt does not matter how much money was channeled, it is still an offense,\u201d Ayob told BenarNews on Friday.\n\nZulkifli\u2019s wife and children were in the court and were seen crying after the judge delivered the sentence. The defendant was arrested on Oct. 30, 2018, at the country\u2019s administrative capital, Putrajaya, on a charge that he had sent money to Akel Zainal.\n\nThe initial charge for terror financing carried a maximum sentence of 30 years, but Zulkifli\u2019s lawyers appealed and the court amended the charge to one that carried a much lighter penalty. The court did not reveal why it was amended.\n\nJoined IS in Syria\n\nAkel, who rose to fame in Malaysia in the 1990s as a drummer in a rock band, Kumpulan Ukays, left the country in 2014 to join Islamic State (IS) in Syria. Eight months ago, he died in a Russian airstrike that also killed his wife and their two young children in Baghouz, Syria, the last IS bastion in that country, according to Ayob.\n\nAkel was one of two senior IS leaders from Malaysia who were killed in airstrikes this year, Ayob said.\n\nThe other, Mohd Rafi Udin (also known as Abu Ain and Abu Awn al-Malisi), whom the United States had designated as a global terrorist last year, was killed in a Russian airstrike as he tried to flee from Baghouz in January, the counterterrorist police chief said. Baghouz fell to a U.S.-led coalition of anti-IS forces in late March.\n\nMalaysian authorities previously identified Akel and Rafi along with two others as the main Malaysian recruiters for IS after Muhammad Wanndy Mohamad Jedi, who had held that role, was killed in a drone attack in Syria in April 2017.\n\nIn 2016, Wanndy\u2019s older brother, Mohamad Danny, pleaded guilty in a Malacca court to a similar charge of allowing his bank account to be used to fund terror-related activities.\n\nDanny pleaded guilty to allowing 12,310 ringgit ($2,962) to be channeled into his account and allowing 10,000 ringgit ($2,406) to be withdrawn to fund terror activities between Jan. 28 and March 5, 2016."}}
