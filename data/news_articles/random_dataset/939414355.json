American President Trump recalled tariffs on Canadian aluminum ahead of signing an executive order to increase hardships for Chinese tech giants. Additionally, lawmakers in the US couldn\u2019t overcome the differences concerning phase 04 coronavirus (COVID-19) relief package. The same delays the government\u2019s decision over the already expired unemployment claim benefits.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, MSCI\u2019s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slumps over 1.4% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 loses 0.72% to 22,250 as we write ahead of the European session. Australia\u2019s ASX 200 couldn\u2019t cheer the $15.6 billion addition to the JobKeeper program amid worries over China, which also dragged New Zealand\u2019s NZX 50 down over 1.2% by the press time.\n\nMoving on, stocks in China and Hong Kong drops the most, near 2.0%, while following the logic whereas South Korea\u2019s KOSPI and India\u2019s BSE Sensex mark lesser losses than Indonesian\u2019s IDX that drops over 1.0%.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the S&P 500 Futures weakens over 0.50% to slip below 3,330 and the US 10-year Treasury yields decline 1.3 basis points (bps) to 0.523% as we write.\n\nAlthough US Senators have called the week off, with the assent to return on negotiation table at 03:00 PM EDT on Monday, US President Trump\u2019s signals to sign another executive order to safeguard the jobless claims could renew market sentiment. However, any disappointment can\u2019t be ruled out as both the parties are far in their proposals with the Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell pushing lawmakers to forgo August vacation.\n\nTalking about the data, Chinese trade numbers could gain any major reaction amid the risk-off mood and the pre-NFP trading lull. As a result, July month US employment data will be closely observed with the headline Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) likely receded from 4800K to 1600K."}}
