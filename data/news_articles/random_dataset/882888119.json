His M.O. for murdering women somewhat matches the description of how she died. I left all the information on their voicemail.\u201d\n\nOur entire nation has been rocked by Little\u2019s shocking story, since he has confessed to 93 murders while serving a life prison sentence for several of the deaths. From 1970 to 2005, Little alleges to having strangled his victims and then documented their deaths with hand-drawn portraits. \u201cFBI crime analysts believe all of Little\u2019s 93 confessions are credible, but so far they\u2019ve only been able to verify 50 of them,\u201d reported a recent CNN article.\n\nEarly in October, the FBI dubbed the 79-year old incarcerated man \u201cthe most prolific serial killer in U.S. history.\u201d Now, the FBI is soliciting the public\u2019s help in identifying some of the unaccounted for victims, because they deserve justice.\n\nMaybe justice is why the Buckskin Girl\u2019s story has haunted me, ever since I moved to Troy. To explain, she was a 21-year-old murder victim whose body was found in Miami County on Greenlee Road off of St. Rt. 55, not far from the I-75 exit.\n\nWhen the deceased young woman was discovered on April 24, 1981, she was \u201c\u2026 wearing bell-bottom blue jeans, a brown turtleneck sweater \u2026 and a handmade tan buckskin pullover jacket with leather fringe around the seams and a deep purple lining,\u201d according to an archived Troy Daily News article by editor Melody Vallieu from April 12, 2018.\n\n\u201cAn autopsy concluded she was strangled to death, but also suffered blunt-force trauma to her head and also had a lacerated liver,\u201d reported Vallieu. For almost four decades, no one knew who the victim was. Local law enforcement kept the tragic case open, but it remained unsolved. The anonymous girl was given her infamous nickname because of the coat she had on.\n\nIn some strange way, there are folks like myself in the Troy area who seemed to have claimed her. The \u201cBuckskin girl\u201d was buried in Troy\u2019s Riverside Cemetery with the headstone, \u201cJane Doe,\u201d and the date of death, April 22, 1981.\n\nOne reason I\u2019ve been personally tied to her case is due to the tenacity of the old reporter who lives inside of me. Another reason is because I\u2019m also a mother, concerned about her family never knowing what happened to her. Most importantly though, her senseless brutal death cries out for justice.\n\nTo some folks, last \u201c\u2018Buckskin Girl\u2019 identified\u201d by Vallieu sent ripples of relief regarding the case throughout the tight-knit community. Aided by the advance in DNA technology, the DNA Doe Project positively confirmed \u201cJane Doe\u201d was in reality Marcia L. Sossoman (King) 21, of Arkansas.\n\nIn the past, when I contemplated the fate of the Buckskin Girl, sometimes I would pray for law enforcement to be given some divine assistance. It sure seemed rather miraculous to find out who she was 37 years later. Now, if only the same kind of miracle could happen regarding finding her murderer.\n\nThat\u2019s when I read about Samuel Little confessing to killing a Cincinnati woman named Anna Stewart in 1981. He dumped the 33-year-old mother of three\u2019s body in Grove City. The 1981 murder places Little in Ohio during the same year Sossoman (King) was killed.\n\nAll those months ago, I had to call the FBI wondering about a possible link between her murder and Little\u2019s killing spree. There was no sexual assault, as was Little\u2019s M.O. because he found strangling his victims a perverse form of sexual release. The \u201cBuckskin girl\u2019s\u201d liver was lacerated, and Little didn\u2019t use weapons.\n\nBeside, Little admittedly went after prostitutes and drug addicts, women he thought no one would miss. Marcia Sossoman (King) had good hygiene, dental care and a mother who waited for her in the same house for 37 years. She doesn\u2019t seem to fit that description either. But one thing is for sure, someone murdered the \u201cBuckskin girl,\u201d and she deserves justice. All of Little\u2019s victims deserve justice, too!\n\nSo, if you have any information about any possible victims of Samuel Little, please go to the FBI website to view the cases and sketches at j.mp/2oorgOV or contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI or submit at tip online at tips.fbi.gov.\n\nhttps://www.limaohio.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/web1_Claypool-Christina-Ryan-WEB-1.jpg\n\nBy Christina Ryan Claypool Guest Columnist\n\nChristina Ryan Claypool is a freelance journalist and inspirational speaker.
