We stand fast by this principle,\u201d President Tsai warned China in her address.\n\nStory continues\n\nHer comments drew a swift rebuke from Beijing, which said it would \u201cnever leave any room for any form of 'Taiwan independence' activities.\u201d\n\nPresident Tsai said Taiwan would not accept Chinese rule - AFP\n\nOnly 15 countries, mainly small Pacific, Central American and African nations, have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but Taipei enjoys strong international support from informal allies including the US, UK and Japan.\n\nJoe Biden, the Democrat presidential candidate, and Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, congratulated President Tsai on Twitter. \u201cTaiwan\u2019s vibrant democracy is an inspiration to the region and the world,\u201d said Mr Pompeo.\n\nIn recent weeks, a US-backed coalition pushed for Taiwan\u2019s inclusion as an observer at this week\u2019s virtual World Health Assembly, in part in recognition of its successful strategy in combatting Covid-19.\n\nTaiwan has kept infection numbers at a low 440, and deaths at seven, while donating millions of face masks around the world.\n\nMany key health workers were granted a coveted place at the inauguration ceremony, where seats were spaced 1.5 metres apart, and singled out in Ms Tsai\u2019s speech as heroes of the crisis."}}
