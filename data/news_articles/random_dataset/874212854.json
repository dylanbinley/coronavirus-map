Cleanups require extensive tests of soil and water and public documentation of those efforts. The owners of the sites usually pay for the bulk of the cleanup while the EPA looks over their shoulder.\n\nThe process of listing a Superfund site begins with the EPA\u2019s Hazard Ranking System, which measures the threat to human health and the environment on a 100-point scale. A score above 28.5 qualifies that place for a Superfund designation, which would make cleanup a federal priority.\n\nIn 1991, the EPA calculated a hazard score for Naval Station Treasure Island, the base that included all of Treasure Island \u2014 the flat, artificial island stretching for 400 acres at the midspan of the Bay Bridge \u2014 and portions of neighboring Yerba Buena Island.\n\nThe base\u2019s score was 51.78, the new documents show, almost double the threshold for Superfund consideration and slightly higher than the score for the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in the southeast corner of San Francisco, which was named a Superfund site in 1989.\n\nBut Superfund listing is not mandatory if the score exceeds 28.5, and Treasure Island was never stamped with the classification. Instead of leading the cleanup, the EPA took a back seat, allowing the California Department of Toxic Substances Control to monitor the project.\n\nPhoto: The Chronicle In 1991, the EPA assessed Naval Station Treasure Island for...\n\nEnvironmental advocacy groups said the decision led to a dysfunctional and delayed cleanup, making the process less transparent and leaving thousands of Treasure Island residents in the dark for years about contamination near their homes. In 2007, when Navy contractors started to discover radioactive objects across the island that weren\u2019t supposed to be there, the EPA officially remained on the sidelines without ever fully explaining why.\n\nFederal documents about the EPA and Treasure Island were released to The Chronicle and a nonprofit environmental watchdog group, Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), under separate Freedom of Information Act requests. The Chronicle obtained related EPA emails and documents through a different request.\n\n\u201cTreasure Island is what we call a \u2018Shadow Superfund site\u2019 \u2014 a toxic stain that has remained in the shadows,\u201d PEER\u2019s Pacific director, Jeff Ruch, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nBradley Angel, executive director of the San Francisco nonprofit group Greenaction for Health and Environmental Justice, called on the EPA to reevaluate the risk of the site and investigate the work that has been done so far. \u201cNobody\u2019s minding the store,\u201d Angel said. \u201cIt is just another example of public agencies looking the other way.\u201d\n\nThe site\u2019s private developer, Treasure Island Community Development, said in a statement Wednesday that it was \u201cflat wrong\u201d to suggest that the cleanup has been flawed, calling those claims \u201cbogus.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver the past three decades, hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to identify and remove contaminants per State of California standards in order to ensure the island is safe for development,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe work has been closely supervised by multiple public agencies and reviewed by independent entities.\u201d Treasure Island Community Development said it was delivering \u201cdesperately needed housing within the City of San Francisco.\u201d\n\nThe records obtained by The Chronicle and PEER do not make clear why Treasure Island never made the Superfund list. But in a 1998 document, the EPA listed opposition from the state as a \u201cmoderate factor\u201d for the island not being added to the list. A federal review of the Superfund program later found that some state governors cited \u201cthe perceived stigma of (National Priorities List) listing and potential adverse economic effect\u201d as reasons for not supporting listings of eligible sites.\n\nThen-California Gov. Pete Wilson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The EPA did not answer specific questions about why Treasure Island never made the list, and the Navy did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAn official with the state Department of Toxic Substances Control said a hazard score is just the start of the listing process.\n\n\u201cRecognizing that the EPA implements the Superfund program, the final number in the hazard ranking score system doesn\u2019t mean that one site is more hazardous than another,\u201d said Grant Cope, the department\u2019s deputy director for site mitigation and restoration. \u201cThat requires a more in-depth investigation.\u201d\n\nRobert Beck, director of the city\u2019s Treasure Island Development Authority, defended the island\u2019s cleanup and oversight, which he called extensive.\n\n\u201cThe Treasure Island Development Authority remains confident in the measures taken by the Navy to identify and appropriately remediate environmental concerns on Yerba Buena Island and Treasure Island and the oversight of those measures provided by the State of California,\u201d Beck said in a statement.\n\nA state official said in a 2017 email obtained by The Chronicle that although Treasure Island isn\u2019t on the Superfund list, \u201cIt is still treated like a Superfund site in that it is going through the same stringent cleanup requirements.\u201d\n\nThe real estate project could bring thousands of new homes and residents to the area. More than half of the island, now home to about 1,800 people, has been declared free of radioactive hazards and transferred from the Navy to the city. Much of the rest is still being investigated for radioactivity and toxic substances.\n\nThe Army Corps of Engineers built Treasure Island in 1936 to host the Golden Gate International Exposition, a celebration of San Francisco\u2019s iconic bridges. Then, during World War II and throughout the Cold War, the Navy transformed the island into a bustling base, where thousands of sailors and civilians lived, worked, trained and repaired ships.\n\nThose activities polluted the land with unknown quantities of metals, industrial chemicals and radioactive substances, some used in training exercises to prepare for possible nuclear bomb attacks.\n\nIn September 1991, an EPA employee filled out an 18-page worksheet to determine Treasure Island\u2019s hazard score of 51.78. Noting that the \u201ctypes of wastes and contaminants deposited on site are mostly unknown,\u201d the staffer assumed that mercury and PCBs, industrial chemicals banned in 1979, tainted some soil. The EPA reviewer called this a \u201cworst case situation,\u201d but didn\u2019t account for the possibility of radioactive waste.\n\nAs Navy contractors began investigating the island, according to Navy reports, they found \u201ca broad distribution of chemicals in soil and groundwater\u201d at potentially harmful levels, including PCBs, dioxin, lead and volatile organic compounds. The Navy started to identify and remove tainted soil and sediment.\n\nLater, after the Navy closed the base and the city began reusing some buildings for housing, Navy contractors made a series of troubling discoveries, finding and removing more than 600 individual radioactive objects, some in housing areas.\n\nStill, the EPA kept Treasure Island off the Superfund list. In a one-page 2008 document, an EPA staffer wrote that the cleanup was \u201cmaking good progress ... under state oversight\u201d and that future evaluations of Treasure Island\u2019s status were a \u201clower\u201d priority. There are no records of EPA evaluations in the past 11 years.\n\nAn EPA spokeswoman said in a statement Wednesday that the agency \u201cregularly checks in with its state and other federal agency partners on the status of cleanup work at this site.\u201d\n\nIn May 2014, Saul Bloom, the leader of San Francisco environmental nonprofit group Arc Ecology, wrote in an email to EPA leaders that the agency should re-score the site and potentially add it to the Superfund list. He argued that the EPA was the only institution powerful and neutral enough to find credible answers about contamination.\n\n\u201cThe simple fact is we have learned more about TI (Treasure Island) in the past three years than we have in all the preceding ones since the (cleanup) began and the story is troubling,\u201d Bloom wrote. \u201cRight now residents of TI do not know where in government they can go for an unbiased point of view on their health and exposure.\u201d\n\nBloom, who died in 2016, also submitted a Freedom of Information Act request for documents about the site, asking the EPA for details about its decision to leave Treasure Island off the Superfund list. His questions initially stumped some EPA officials.\n\n\u201cNo one is sure if it was ever scored and ranked,\u201d a regional project manager emailed to a colleague in 2014. After doing some research, he added in another email, \u201cThe site exceeded the score for listing. I don\u2019t know the history as to why it was never listed.\u201d\n\nJason Fagone and Cynthia Dizikes are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers.
