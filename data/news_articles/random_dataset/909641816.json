Clement Manyathela, presenter - Midday Report\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa met with representatives from the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) on Monday.\n\nLast week, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni tabled a budget that proposes to cut Government\u2019s gargantuan wage bill by R160 billion over the next three years.\n\nCivil servant salaries have skyrocketed by 40% - in real terms \u2013 over the past 12 years with no increase in productivity, admits Treasury.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa at a Cosatu rally. Picture: @MYANC/Twitter.\n\nClement Manyathela interviewed Cosatu Secretary-General Bheki Ntshalintshali.\n\nWage issues can\u2019t be negotiated at Nedlac\u2026 So, we did not discuss\u2026 The decision by the Minister to opt out of an existing agreement \u2013 that agreement must be honoured! We\u2019re not going to discuss it again\u2026 Bheki Ntshalintshali, Secretary-General - Cosatu\n\nIt\u2019s a bad approach! You can\u2019t enter into an agreement and lie to unions\u2026 on the eve of implementation, you get another Minister of Finance saying we want to recover R162 billion\u2026 There\u2019s nothing to discuss\u2026 Bheki Ntshalintshali, Secretary-General - Cosatu\n\n130 000 vacancies haven\u2019t been filled. Workers are doing double work\u2026 Those people are earning peanuts and finding it difficult to make ends meet. Unless anybody is suggesting that they must commit suicide. Bheki Ntshalintshali, Secretary-General - Cosatu\n\nListen to the interview in the audio below."}}
