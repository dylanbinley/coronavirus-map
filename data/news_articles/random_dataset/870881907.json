Instead we\u2019re giving locals an opportunity to have their licence on an app, if that\u2019s their preference.\u201d\n\nTMR staff are planning to hold community engagement forms in the trial sites starting later this month.\n\nSA remains the only state to have rolled out digital driver's licences, with NSW still trialing their digital offering two years after announcing the first trial site.\n\nLast week Service NSW confirmed it had delayed the state-wide launch, which had been planned to take place last month, until late 2019."}}
