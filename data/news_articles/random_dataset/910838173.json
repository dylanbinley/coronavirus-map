The Taliban immediately denied responsibility for the assault, which occurred at the commemoration ceremony for Abdul Ali Mazari\u2014a politician from the Hazara ethnic group.\n\nThe Islamic State terror group claimed responsibility the attack later in the evening. \u201cTwo brothers... targeted a gathering of apostates... in Kabul city with machine guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled grenades,\u201d it said in a statement via the Telegram messaging app.\n\nThe IS group-claimed attack on the same ceremony last year saw a barrage of mortar fire kill at least 11 people.\n\nRahimi had earlier said that gunfire had erupted from a construction site near the ceremony in the city\u2019s west. Photos on social media showed several dead bodies being collected after the attack. President Ashraf Ghani condemned the massacre, calling it a \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d. The ceremony was attended by many of the country\u2019s political elite, including Afghanistan\u2019s chief executive Abdullah Abdullah. The interior ministry later confirmed to reporters that \u201call the high-ranking officials were safely evacuated from the scene\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe left the ceremony following the gunfire, and a number of people were wounded, but I do not have any reports of martyred people for now,\u201d Hazara leader Mohammad Mohaqiq told Tolo News.\n\nPakistan strongly condemned the terror attack. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with those who have suffered in this tragedy. We are relieved that the leadership has remained unharmed,\u201d Foreign Office Spokesperson Aisha Farooqui said in a statement.\n\nThe spokesperson said that Pakistan had consistently supported a negotiated political solution of the Afghan conflict. \u201cThis is a historic juncture. Pakistan urges all the parties to work together in a constructive spirit for establishing durable peace and stability in Afghanistan,\u201d the statement concluded.\n\nThe incident comes less than a week after the US and Taliban signed a deal that would pave the way for the complete withdrawal of foreign troops in 14 months. The US withdrawal hinges to a great extent on the Taliban being able to control terrorist forces such as the Islamic State group.\n\nIf such groups remain, so too does the American military. Since the much-trumpeted deal signing, fighting has continued to rage across Afghanistan, casting a pall over hopes the agreement would lead to a reduction in violence and talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government."}}
