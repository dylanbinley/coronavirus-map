CNN\u2019s Matt Rivers reports.\n\nStay at home, be safe, but go hungry. Go out, earn a living, but risk your life. For so many in Mexico, this has been the pandemic\u2019s impossible choice.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a difficult enough choice if you\u2019re a shopkeeper or a cab driver. But it\u2019s on another level if you\u2019re a sex worker.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so scared for my health,\u201d said Alejandra, a sex worker in Tijuana, who asked we only use her first name. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the person I\u2019m with has the disease or not.\u201d\n\nWelcome to Tijuana\n\nTijuana, Mexico\u2019s famed red-light district, called Zona Norte, sits a stone\u2019s throw from the US-Mexico border. Calle Coahuila, the area\u2019s main strip, is normally teeming with a frenetic action bathed in neon light.\n\nWomen in short dresses and the highest of high heels stand along the sidewalks, beckoning groups of men to spend some time and money with them. Massive strip clubs, some with hotels attached, act as de facto brothels.\n\nMany specifically cater to the thousands of Americans who cross the border from California each month, looking for a kind of fun that can\u2019t be found legally in the United States, except maybe in some Nevada counties where prostitution is permitted.\n\nAll of it is legal here \u2014 or, at least, it was until the pandemic descended.\n\nShutdown\n\nMexico\u2019s government shuttered its economy in late March. Non-essential businesses were forced to close, including in the state of Baja California, where Tijuana is the largest city.\n\nThat meant that all the strip clubs, bars, sex hotels and even the sex workers on the sidewalks were forced to close up shop, restrictions that remain in place today.\n\nThe land border between the United States and Mexico was also closed to non-essential travel. It was all done with the intent of slowing the virus\u2019 spread.\n\nBut on a recent reporting trip to Tijuana, it was abundantly clear that while the sex industry isn\u2019t as vibrant as it was pre-pandemic, there\u2019s a lot of sex happening behind closed doors.\n\nSome follow the rules, some don\u2019t\n\nThere\u2019s something odd about standing in an empty strip club with the lights on. But it\u2019s where we met Roberto Torres, who owns the El Zorro Men\u2019s Club, just off the district\u2019s main drag.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re safe to open yet,\u201d he told us. \u201cSo, I\u2019m not going to put myself at risk or my employees at risk either.\u201d\n\nHe had to let go of all his female employees. He says most of them went home but for those that didn\u2019t, he has an idea where some could\u2019ve ended up.\n\nReopening his business would be illegal, but in Tijuana, it\u2019s clear other business owners don\u2019t care. \u201cPeople are opening, certain places are open, certain [sex] hotels are open,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new way of life is to risk your life\n\nNearly 8,000 workers are registered with the government but there are likely hundreds, if not thousands more that aren\u2019t registered.\n\nMany have left town or stopped working, according to local state police CNN spoke to, but there are those that stayed because they are supplying the demand that remains.\n\nAlthough the border is officially closed to non-essential travel, there are exceptions for dual citizens and few vehicles are stopped for checks by Mexican officials. So it\u2019s relatively easy to make the short trip.\n\nAnd some Americans are still coming here to have sex.\n\nThey do so with people like Alejandra, whom we found working near a migrant shelter in the city.\n\nShe cautiously agreed to speak with us somewhere private. CNN producer Natalie Gall\u00f3n let her borrow some everyday clothes, so she wouldn\u2019t attract the attention of the hotel staff when we arrived.\n\n\u201cThings are really bad for me, right now,\u201d said the several-year veteran of the industry, now in her mid-twenties. \u201cI\u2019m constantly worried, every single day.\u201d\n\nShe said the pandemic has hit her in two ways, watching her customer base decline while also exponentially increasing the risk of an already dangerous job.\n\n\u201cI just have no idea what\u2019s going to happen, or if I\u2019m going to get infected,\u201d she said, shifting nervously from side to side in her chair as we spoke.\n\nShe\u2019s tried to put extra sanitation measures in place. Her clients now have to shower and wash their hands before being with her. She has implemented a no-kissing rule and uses hand sanitizer gel throughout the process.\n\nBut this is sex. Physical contact is unavoidable. Alejandra knows this but says she has no choice. The only way she can provide for her 6-year-old daughter is by going to work.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t work, we don\u2019t eat,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat will I do tomorrow if I end up getting sick? But I still have to go out even though I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nAnother sex worker we spoke to who uses the name Adanna, said she\u2019s only been able to afford not to work because two of her regular American clients send her some money each month.\n\n\u201cWithout them, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do,\u201d saying that even with the payments she barely gets food on the table for her 5-year-old daughter.\n\nIf the government says it\u2019s safe enough for the businesses to reopen, Adanna told us she\u2019d go right back to work.\n\nJaqueline Aguilar, 34, a transgender sex worker in Ensenada, about two hours south of Tijuana, told CNN over the phone that she returned to work because she had to make ends meet.\n\nShe\u2019s been a sex worker since she was 13 and her day-to-day fears have changed since the pandemic hit Mexico.\n\n\u201cBefore, my fears were of violence, that a client would kill me or hurt me. Now, my fear is the pandemic, to go out and God forbid I get infected and can\u2019t work. How would I eat?\u201d\n\nThe government keeps track of workers in different industries who have gotten the virus, in sectors like healthcare. No such data exists for sex workers.\n\nAguilar, who is also a founder of an organization supporting transgender women and women in the sex industry, says she knows of at least three colleagues who had Covid-19 symptoms but never got tested. Rather, she said, they isolated at home.\n\n\u2018I feel completely safe\u2019\n\nWe spoke to business owners and sex workers during the day in Tijuana, but the only way to get a true gauge on the situation in the red-light district is to head out at night.\n\nThis is not a place where journalists are welcome, so we rode through the streets with Baja California State Police.\n\nAt first glance, a lot of businesses look closed. The front doors at some of the bigger and more famous strip clubs are locked. Smaller places have metal gates pulled down over storefronts.\n\nBut a closer look prompts questions. Why, if the bigger strip clubs are closed, did many we pass still have bouncers out front? Why, if the sex hotels are closed, did many have women out front beckoning people inside?\n\n\u201cThe trade is still happening,\u201d said the police commander driving the pickup we were in. \u201cIt\u2019s just happening behind closed doors.\u201d\n\nThat fact was quickly confirmed by the Americans we saw and heard on the streets and one American we met, standing outside a sex hotel where he\u2019d been staying for a few days, hiring different women.\n\n\u201cLots of Americans here,\u201d said the man who appeared to be in his late 50\u2019s and asked that we not use his name. \u201cThey walk across the border and they come here and do their thing.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s being safe, wiping his hotel room down with antibacterial wipes and not eating indoors. All very safe, except for the part where he has sex with a stranger, which he says he and other Americans here have no problem with.\n\n\u201cI believe I\u2019m pretty well educated about all of this,\u201d he said. Challenged by the fact that experts on viral epidemiology would universally disagree with him, he would only say he feels, \u201ccompletely safe.\u201d\n\nHis ignorance about the risks is what puts the lives of the women he hires in danger. But, he\u2019s also helping them put food on the table.\n\nThey are the two sides of a very dangerous coin.\n\ncnn"}}
