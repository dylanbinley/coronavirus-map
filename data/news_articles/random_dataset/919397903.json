They\u2019re doing okay. And they\u2019re really struggling.\n\nAs commercial horticulture agent Lisa Rayburn of the Cooperative Extension Office put it, \u201cEverybody had to make some changes, but impacts are very much determined by what type of business it is.\u201d\n\nHorticultural farms \u2013 that is, those that grow the fruits and vegetables that people frequently eat (as opposed to tobacco, field corn, cotton or soy beans) tend to see through one of three channels: direct to the consumer, to a restaurant market, or to wholesale which includes grocery stores and some grocery markets.\n\nWhile some of the larger farms market to all three, many area farms focus their investment on handling only one or two.\n\nDirect to consumer markets are the simplest, and are where some of the smallest farms have their investment. Using farmer\u2019s markets and their own roadside markets, and also including \u201cpick your own\u201d for berry crops.\n\nDuring the pandemic, these farms are doing mostly very well: farmers believe shoppers are coming, in part, to avoid the possible crowds of supermarkets and to support the local farms in their shopping. Going to a farm or farmer\u2019s market not only gives shoppers fresh produce \u2013 it gets them out of the house and into a more cheerful environment for a while.\n\nButch White\u2019s 14-acre farm in Vanceboro, which gets much of its income from strawberries, is doing well, for instance. \u201cWe\u2019re doing right fair,\u201d he said, but \u201cI\u2019ve never washed up or wiped down so much in all my life.\u201d\n\nThe area\u2019s county-run farmers markets have had to make adjustments. In New Bern, where the farmer\u2019s market is run year-round, booths selling crafts or flags or other non-essentials have been temporarily closed with only those selling farm products or baked goods being open. The aisles have been made wider and one-way to encourage social distancing, while vendors are wearing masks.\n\n\u201cAt first they didn\u2019t know if they could stay open,\u201d Rayburn said. As time went on, \u201cthings were changing week by week.\u201d The farmers markets in Kinston and Jacksonville have only recently opened, she added. \u201cThey come in with the strawberries,\u201d and, opening later, \u201chave had the opportunity to see how the other markets were working and adapt.\u201d\n\nGrocery stores are obviously continuing to buy produce, but the restaurant market has all but dried up.\n\nDanny Strange, who owns Friday\u2019s 1890 Seafood and Annabelles in New Bern, said that \u201cSales are down 80 percent, and my food orders are down to match.\u201d While both restaurants are open and selling meals curbside, he said the businesses are both struggling. \u201cHardly none of my staff is working,\u201d he said, noting that his two sons and himself \u201care working for free.\u201d\n\nSabrina Bengel, who owns Baker\u2019s Kitchen Beer Army in downtown New Bern, reported the same figure of business being 80 percent down.\n\nWith the exception of selling produce to institutions, that means the produce business is also cut down 80 percent.\n\nJulie McKeon, who runs the New Bern Farmers Market, said that she has encouraged farms that normally sell to restaurants to give the market a try.\n\nBut sometimes it isn\u2019t that simple.\n\nGrocery stores require a completely different form of packaging than straight-to-consumer sales, and farms not already set up for that aren\u2019t ready or able to make the required changes, either by equipment or labor, that quickly. Also, the farmers may not be able to make the contacts they need to succeed in a different venue, especially with other farms already established in those markets.\n\n\u201cYou have to find those markets and be able to package products in a way that meets that market demand, and do that at a price where you\u2019re still making money,\u201d Rayburn said.\n\nLarger farms, meanwhile, often have far too much product to sell on a direct-to-consumer base, since their products spoil quickly, this means a lot of unsold plants could ultimately be destroyed by the farmers in the fields. It\u2019s a loss, but not as big a loss as hiring hands to harvest crops that will never sell.\n\nRayburn said that it\u2019s impossible to say whether the vegetable farmers, over all, are doing well or poorly. Along with the struggles under the coronavirus, farms are also dealing with several years of bad weather that have damaged or destroyed many crops. \u201cThe crystal ball\u2019s broken,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFarms that sell direct to the consumer are doing well and meeting higher demands. The ones that are struggling, those guys who were on the restaurant market and the institutional market, this may be one more nail in the coffin.\u201d\n\nFarms that are already selling to two or three markets are depending on the direct-to-consumer market to get through the coronavirus shutdown. Curtis Smith, of the 300-acre T.C. Smith Produce in Seven Springs, said that his farmer\u2019s market \u2013 both in Kinston and on his farm \u2013 are helping him overcome the losses he is taking in restaurant business.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate that we\u2019re diversified,\u201d he said. While \u201cRestaurants have cut back on what they\u2019re ordering \u2013 some are not ordering at all \u2013 more people have come to the farm to buy items.\n\n\u201cPeople are really wanting to get out and buy something fresh and local grown. They\u2019ve been really supportive.\u201d"}}
