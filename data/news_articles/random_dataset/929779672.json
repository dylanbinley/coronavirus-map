We love my brother. He has a heart of gold and he lived to make everyone laugh. I miss my baby brother.\u201d\n\nIn an email to the Dawson County News, Dawson County Sheriff Jeff Johnson said that his office extends it\u2019s sympathies to the Sanford family for the teen\u2019s death, stating that due to the investigation by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation it has been necessary to limit what information is released, even to immediate family members.\n\n\u201cAn unfortunate side effect of not releasing all the Information is that rumors and speculation run rampant,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOne such rumor is that Jonathan was left unchecked for 13 hours. This is completely false.\u201d\n\nWhile denying the rumor, Johnson said that at this point the times and contact that law enforcement officers had with Sanford during his arrest are relevant to the investigation, and not releasable at this time.\n\n\u201cAnytime an individual dies while in law enforcement custody, questions will be raised and rightfully so,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThis is why an outside, independent agency is requested to handle the investigation.\u201d\n\nAn incident report obtained through open records request by the DCN shows that Jonathan Sanford was arrested Tuesday, June 1, on a narcotics charge and for DUI Drugs.\n\nPrior to Sanford\u2019s arrest, the report states that Dawson County deputies were searching for a possible impaired driver identified by a witness several hours earlier and after a traffic stop at 378 Marketplace Parkway in south Dawson County, the teen was taken into custody.\n\nFollowing Sanford\u2019s death, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation was called in to investigate the death.\n\nDue to the GBI investigation, a sheriff\u2019s office records manager also denied the DCN\u2019s request for an officer\u2019s investigative summary that usually accompanies incident reports.\n\nIn a statement to the Dawson County News on Thursday, GBI spokeswoman Nelly Miles said that there has been no update in the state\u2019s investigation of Sanford\u2019s death, beyond that the teen\u2019s autopsy is pending further tests.\n\nJohnson said that regardless of the GBI investigation, the incident also allows the sheriff\u2019s office to critique its own processes and implement changes if necessary.\n\n\u201cWe trust that our community will reserve judgment until the investigation has been completed and the details have been released,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nCheck back to dawsonnews.com for any updates to this story.\n\nReporter Jacob Smith contributed to this report."}}
