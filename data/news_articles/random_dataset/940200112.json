When you see videos of students in crowded hallways without masks, it is clear that they are not following the level of detail we are committed to in our individual school plans,\u201d Perda said. \u201cThat is why starting the year with good orientation and agreeing to expectations on everyone\u2019s part is key to our overall mission to educate these students to the best of our ability.\u201d\n\nThe Diocese of Worcester\u2019s plans to reopen are aligned with many other private schools across the country.\n\n\u201cMost are trying to do in person,\u201d Kathy Mears, the CEO of the National Catholic Education Association, told National Catholic Reporter. \u201cIt\u2019s what most people want, keeping in mind however that everybody understands that the safety of children comes first, and the safety of teachers comes first.\u201d\n\nThe smaller class sizes and flexibility compared to that of public schools make it easier for these schools to return in-person in the fall, NCR reported.\n\nAnd while Massachusetts Catholic schools were not required to submit their plans to DESE, Perda said the diocese chose to submit their plans \u201cgiven the depth of expertise at the state\u2019s disposal.\u201d\n\nRelated Content:"}}
