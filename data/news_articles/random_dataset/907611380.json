Putin of Russia favored President Trump\u2019s re-election. The briefing later prompted Mr. Trump\u2019s anger as he complained that Democrats would use it against him.\n\nJoseph Maguire, the former acting director of national intelligence, and his deputy, Andrew P. Hallman, resigned on Friday. Mr. Grenell told Mr. Hallman, popular in the office\u2019s Liberty Crossing headquarters, that his service was no longer needed, according to two officials. Mr. Hallman, who has worked in the office or at the C.I.A. for three decades, expressed confidence in his colleagues in a statement but also referred to the \u201cuncertainties that come with change.\u201d\n\nThe ouster of Mr. Hallman and exit of Mr. Maguire, who also oversaw the National Counterterrorism Center, allowed Mr. Grenell to install his own leadership team."}}
