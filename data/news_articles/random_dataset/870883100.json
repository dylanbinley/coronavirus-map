Japan has abandoned developing it as it may affect people's health. We need to be putting the health of the people of this country before financial gain,\u201d Cllr Warnock stated.\n\n\u201cIf there's a concern about it the precautionary principle should apply,\u201d he added.\n\nCllr Warnock concluded by saying, \u201cWe are like mushrooms, we're being kept in the dark and fed crap.\u201d\n\nHis proposal was seconded by Cllr Gerry Dolan and supported by Cllr Mary Bohan who said the proposal should also be sent to the Minister for Health.\n\nCathaoirleach, Cllr Enda McGloin, proposed the motions as presented also be sent to the EPA.\n\n\u201cWe should send copies to the agency given that the minister has assigned a new statutory function to the EPA to provide general information to the public on such matters,\u201d he said.\n\nCllr Sean McGowan said some of the facts are \u201cquite alarming\u201d and asked the executive to put a stall on any application until all the facts are determined.\n\nChief Executive, Lar Power, said he accepted Cllr McGowan's point about the concerns but stated a planning application has to be considered and it can't not be considered.\n\nCllr Des Guckian said the 5G companies are \u201ctrying to bulldoze this through\u201d and he called on them to prove it is safe.\n\nJoseph Gilhooly explained there are quite a number of exemptions in regard to antennae in the planning regulations for the purpose of telecommunications by statutory instrument in 2018.\n\nHe said emissions in Ireland were found to be thousands of times below the guidelines by ComReg.\n\nCllrs Bohan and Warnock both said those findings were irrelevant as they pertained to 4G.\n\nCllr Bohan also questioned why were all the exemptions made by the Minister.\n\nCllr Padraig Fallon proposed they call on the Minister and Department of the Environment for a review of all the items that are exempt. This was seconded by Cllr Bohan."}}
