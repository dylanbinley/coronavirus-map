US weather forecasters warned that some areas of the Carolina coast could see dangerous storm surge of up to seven feet and between six and 12 inches of rain.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re in for a long night and we\u2019ll be eager to see the sunshine in the morning,\u201d North Carolina\u2019s Governor Roy Cooper told CNN. The slow-moving monster sto-rm also spawned several tornadoes but there were no immediate reports of casualties. Many residents of coastal Carolina heeded evacuation orders while others battened down their homes with plywood and prepared to ride out the tempest.\n\nAt 8 pm (0000 GMT), the Miami-based National Hurricane Centre (NHC) said Dorian was a Category 2 storm packing winds of 100 miles per hour (160 km per hour).\n\nIt was located about 50 km south of Cape Fear in North Carolina."}}
