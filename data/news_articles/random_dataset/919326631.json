Also, no unusual developments have been detected inside North Korea,\u201d Blue House spokesman Kang Min-seok said in the statement.\n\nPeople watch a TV screen showing a news programme reporting about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (Lee Jin-man/AP)\n\nThe Blue House later said Mr Kim was believed to be staying at an unspecified location outside of Pyongyang with some of his close confidants.\n\nThe office said Mr Kim appeared to be normally engaged with state affairs and there were not any unusual movement or emergency reaction from the North\u2019s ruling party, military or cabinet.\n\nA US official said the White House was aware before the reports appeared late on Monday that Mr Kim\u2019s health might be precarious.\n\nThe official said the US had information that Mr Kim may have undergone surgery and that complications may have rendered him \u201cincapacitated or worse\u201d.\n\nBut, the official stressed that the US had nothing to confirm the surgery had taken place or that any complications had occurred.\n\nThe US official would not elaborate on where the information came from or when it had been received. The White House and State Department had no comment.\n\nA display of photos of North Korean leaders outside the North Korean embassy in Beijing. Kim Jong Un is the third generation of his family to rule the country (Mark Schiefelbein/AP)\n\nYoon Sang-hyun, chairman of South Korea\u2019s National Assembly\u2019s foreign affairs and unification committee, said he was told by unspecified non-government sources that Mr Kim had surgery over cardiovascular problems.\n\nBut an official from Seoul\u2019s National Intelligence Service, who did not want to be named, citing office rules, said the spy agency could not confirm whether Mr Kim had surgery.\n\nKim In-chul, spokesman of South Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said Seoul and Washington are maintaining close communication but did not provide a direct answer when asked whether the allies exchanged any meaningful intelligence about Mr Kim\u2019s health.\n\nJapanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said his government was monitoring the situation.\n\nA political upheaval in North Korea would be unlikely even if Mr Kim became sidelined by health problems, according to analyst Cheong Seong-Chang at the private Sejong Institute in South Korea.\n\nMr Cheong said Mr Kim\u2019s sister, Kim Yo Jong, is already exercising significant influence within the government and that most members of Pyongyang\u2019s leadership share an interest with the Kim family in maintaining the North\u2019s system.\n\nOutside governments and media have a mixed record on tracking developments among North Korea\u2019s ruling elite, made difficult by Pyongyang\u2019s stringent control of information about them.\n\nMr Kim\u2019s absence from state media often triggers speculation. In 2014, Mr Kim vanished from the public eye for nearly six weeks before reappearing with a cane. South Korea\u2019s spy agency said days later that he had a cyst removed from his ankle.\n\nMr Kim, believed to be 36, took power upon his father\u2019s death in December 2011 and is the third generation of his family to rule the nuclear-armed country."}}
