Print.\n\nNORTH LIBERTY, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Democratic presidential candidates promised voters in Iowa on Saturday they would unify the party to take on President Donald Trump even as they kept up their criticism of each other and navigated the lingering divides from the 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident Americans, Republican voters, Democratic voters and independent voters want us to come together,\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden said in North Liberty. \u201cI\u2019m going to do whatever it takes to make progress in the areas that matter most.\u201d\n\nAbout 20 miles away in Cedar Rapids, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren updated her stump speech to include a more explicit call for unity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re down to the final strokes here,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we understand that, we will and we must come together as a party to beat Donald Trump and I\u2019ve got a plan for that.\u201d\n\nAnd Bernie Sanders insisted he would back the ultimate Democratic nominee even if it\u2019s not him.\n\n\u201cLet me say this so there\u2019s no misunderstanding,\u201d the Vermont senator said in Indianola. \u201cIf we do not win, we will support the winner and I know that every other candidate will do the same.\u201d\n\nOn the eve of Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses, the unity pledges marked an early \u2014 and urgent \u2014 effort to avoid the divides that some Democrats say helped Trump win the presidency in 2016. After a year of campaigning, most polls show a tight race between Biden, Warren, Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Those candidates, along with Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and businessman Andrew Yang, crisscrossed Iowa on Saturday seeking a breakout victory that would propel them deeper into the contests that will decide the Democratic nomination.\n\nMost surveys show the top four candidates jumbled at the top. And on Saturday, the final Des Moines Register poll \u2014 traditionally seen as the gold standard survey of the caucus electorate \u2014 was pulled from publication after questions about its methodology. The newspaper said Buttigieg may have been left off the list presented to a caucus-goer in at least one call.\n\nTo break out of the pack, the candidates have focused on a wide variety of policy issues ranging from free college tuition to the role of government in health care, criminal justice reform, gun control and solutions to climate change. But the biggest issue on the minds of many voters is landing on a candidate who can beat Trump.\n\nAnxiety over the party\u2019s ability to unify grew over the past two weeks after Hillary Clinton, Sanders\u2019 2016 primary rival, twice criticized the senator for not doing enough to bring Democrats together after their bruising battle.\n\nThe divide was on display Friday when Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., appeared at a Sanders event in Iowa and booed at the mention of Clinton. She later issued a statement saying she \u201callowed my disappointment with Secretary Clinton\u2019s latest comments about Senator Sanders and his supporters get the best of me\u201d and would \u201cstrive to come from a place of love and not react in the same way of those who are against what we are building in this country.\u201d\n\nFaiz Shakir, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, retweeted her statement and said: \u201cWe love your passion and conviction. Don\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nClinton spokesperson Nick Merrill called that comment \u201cunbelievable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough that she booed her party\u2019s last nominee, but they\u2019re making sure it\u2019s clear she doesn\u2019t have to regret it,\u201d Merrill tweeted.\n\nThe incident underscored questions about how Democrats can thread together clashing factions to develop a coalition that spans generations, races and economic status to defeat Trump. With Sanders showing some signs of strength in Iowa, some voters said they wouldn\u2019t support him because of concerns he would divide the party.\n\nLisa Stolba, a retired school counselor from Cedar Rapids who attended a Biden event in North Liberty, said she\u2019s undecided, considering Klobuchar, Buttigieg, Biden and Warren.\n\nSanders was not on the list for a few reasons. He was too \u201csocialistic,\u201d she worried about his health and age \u2014 Biden\u2019s too, she added \u2014 and she\u2019s wasn\u2019t confident Sanders could unite the party. Stolba, 59, noted she was still smarting over whether he told Warren that a woman can\u2019t win. Sanders denied the comment. \u201cI think that he said it,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Stolba said she\u2019ll still vote for Sanders if were the the nominee. \u201cIf he\u2019s the only one, yeah, I\u2019m not going to vote for Trump.\u201d\n\nSanders, for his part, has drawn crowds stretching into the thousands at his events, a clear demonstration of the enthusiasm surrounding his campaign. It\u2019s that energy, he and his supporters argue, that will bring the party together and inspire voters across the spectrum to support his candidacy in November.\n\nSome candidates saw an opportunity in the infighting. The 38-year-old Buttigieg has made generational change a central argument of his campaign and said Saturday that the divides underscore his point.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t much enjoy as a Democrat living through the experience of 2016 and I want to make sure 2020 resembles 2016 as little as possible,\u201d he told reporters after a rally in Waterloo.\n\nButtigieg went on to emphasize that the candidates \u201care much more aligned than you would think.\u201d\n\nBut on stage later in the day, he revived his criticism of Biden and Sanders, outlining what he called \u201ca respectful difference of approach among people who share the same values, share the same goals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vice president is suggesting this is no time to take a risk on someone new,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m suggesting this is no time to take a risk on trying to meet a fundamentally new challenge with a familiar playbook. It\u2019s going to take something new.\u201d\n\nButtigieg criticized Sanders for \u201coffering an approach that suggests it\u2019s either revolution or it\u2019s the status quo, and there\u2019s nothing in between.\u201d\n\nAnd although he made a pitch to unity, Biden still went after Sanders\u2019 policy checklist on the stump \u2014 though he avoided naming the Vermont senator.\n\n\u201cTalk is cheap. In politics, sometimes talk is very expensive, especially when you don\u2019t tell people how you pay for what you say you\u2019re going to do,\u201d Biden said in Waterloo. \u201cBe straight. Tell the people what it\u2019s going to cost.\u201d\n\nBiden referenced some estimates that put Sanders\u2019 big-ticket proposals on single-payer health care, college debt forgiveness and tuition-free college tuition at more than $60 trillion over 10 years. \u201cI wonder why they don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s gonna cost,\u201d he added, an allusion to Sanders recently telling CBS News that he doesn\u2019t know exactly what his Medicare for All plan would cost the federal government.\n\nSome voters said they felt that, regardless of the divisions within the party, Trump was enough of a unifying factor on his own that Democrats will have no issues after the primary. Tom Taiber, a 73-year-old from Waverly, said he wasn\u2019t worried about Democrats coming together to rally around the party\u2019s eventual nominee, even if the primary becomes divisive.\n\n\u201cThe family of Democrats, we\u2019re going to have differences of opinion,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Julie Pace and Tom Beaumont in Waterloo, Iowa, and Bill Barrow in North Liberty, Iowa, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nCatch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly \u201cGround Game\u2019\u2019 politics podcast\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Associated Press.
