Matt Shea, participated in domestic terrorism by assisting Bundy \u201cin the planning and preparation\u201d of the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016.\n\nThe standoff, which took place in rural Oregon, lasted six weeks after dozens of armed men refused the U.S. government\u2019s orders to vacate the refuge under Bundy's leadership. By the time the standoff ended, one protester was shot and killed, and most of the protesters were arrested.\n\n\u201cRepresentative Shea, as a leader in the Patriot Movement, planned, engaged in and promoted a total of three armed conflicts of political violence against the United States Government in three states outside the state of Washington over a three-year period,\u201d the 180-page report revealed. \u201cIn one conflict Representative Shea led covert strategic pre-planning in advance of the conflict.\u201d\n\nIn response to the report, state Rep. J.T. Wilcox, the Republican minority leader, called for Shea\u2019s resignation and said that he had been \u201csuspended from any role in the House Republican Caucus.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe should resign,\u201d Wilcox tweeted. \u201cHe cannot use House Republican staff, he cannot meet with the caucus, his office will be moved.\u201d\n\nRep. Matt Shea has been suspended from any role in the House Republican Caucus. He should resign. He cannot use House Republican staff, he cannot meet with the caucus, his office will be moved. https://t.co/AATHOHuO31 \u2014 Rep. JT Wilcox (@jtwilcox111) December 20, 2019\n\nShea, 45, refused to resign. He compared the report to President Trump\u2019s impeachment, calling it a \u201csham.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike we are seeing with our President this is a sham investigation meant to silence those of us who stand up against attempts to disarm and destroy our great country. I will not back down, I will not give in, I will not resign,\u201d Shea wrote in a post to Facebook. \u201cStand strong fellow Patriots.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI will continue to defend the constitution against tyranny and fight to protect our God given unalienable rights to life, liberty, property, and the ability to defend the same.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Laurie Jinkins signaled that she would support action to remove Shea from office.\n\nThe Democratic leader explained, \u201cThis is about a state lawmaker who, according to the investigative findings, engaged in an act of domestic terrorism rather than choosing political or legal avenues to change laws and policies he disagrees with. This is why we believe formal action needs to be taken that sends a clear message upholding the values of a free and democratic society, and supports the safety of all Washingtonians.\u201d\n\nThe report revealed that Shea had participated in Bundy\u2019s protests throughout the United States, including standoffs in Nevada, Idaho, and Oregon. If Shea is removed from the Washington State Legislature, he would be the second lawmaker in the state\u2019s history to be removed from office."}}
