Bush got 44% of the Hispanic vote in 2004\u2014long-refuted but apparently unkillable.\n\nNow, after GOP Presidential nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s (narrow) defeat in the 2012 Presidential election, Americans are hearing from both Democrats and Republicans that his problem was being an immigration hardliner, \u201cgiving in\u201d to the \u201cnativist\u201d wing of his party who want immigration laws, well, enforced. See, for example Republicans need to shut up and listen, by Aaron Rodrigues [email him], Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, November 12, 2012.\n\nThis is what John Derbyshire has called \u201chate creep\u201d\u2014every year, the old mild options become the new \u201cHate\u201d. Thus \u201cself-deportation\u201d\u2014Romney\u2019s not entirely original formulation for \u201cattrition through enforcement,\u201d which used to be the milder alternative to mass deportation\u2014is now HATE.\n\nAccordingly, President Obama, in the second debate, duly accused Romney of favoring \"making life so miserable on folks that they'll leave.\" (And, typically, Romney promptly backed off his earlier support for Arizona\u2019s SB 1070, protesting that he only favored its E-Verify provisions.)\n\nBut what\u2019s going on here is Orwellian: a totalitarian drive to eliminate un-PC facts and ideas from public discourse. Case in point: Kevin Drum\u2019s creepy piece in Mother Jones about Sean Hannity\u2019s attempt to surrender on illegal immigration [The GOP's Immigration Problem Goes Way Beyond Immigration, November 8, 2012] suggested, in Steve Sailer\u2019s tart paraphrase, that\n\nImmigration isn't some technical issue like tax rates where the two sides can reach a compromise. It's a test of morals. Amnesty won't be just a practical tool for Democrats to solidify their majority; it will also be a symbolic milestone permanently delegitimizing any and all skepticism about the Democratic-run government electing a new people to elect a Democratic-run government.\u201d\n\nSo let the record show: Mitt Romney was not an immigration hardliner/patriot. He was a wimp\u2014a WIMP!\n\nThe best you could say about Romney\u2019s immigration policies is that he was, as Washington Watcher put it, \u201cNot The Worst From Immigration Patriot Viewpoint\u201d\u2014just as the best you could say about Paul Ryan was: \u201cThank God he\u2019s not Marco Rubio!\u201d\n\nBut suppose that Romney had been the worst (Republican) candidate from an immigration standpoint? How would he have fared with the Latino vote?\n\nIt happens that we can answer that\u2014because the 2000, 2004, and 2008 elections featured George W Bush and John McCain. It\u2019s impossible to imagine two candidates who pandered harder to the Hispanic vote.\n\nBut George W. Bush\u2019s candidacy achieved, at most, 38 percent of the Hispanic vote. John McAmnesty achieved 31 percent. Romney got 28.3%.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about a difference of maybe one per cent of the overall vote\u2014massively overwhelmed by the potential of the white working class.\n\nJames Fulford [Email him] is a writer and editor for VDARE.com."}}
