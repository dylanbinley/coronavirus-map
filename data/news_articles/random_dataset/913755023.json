I\u2019m wondering if, as someone who has been playing a survivor of a zombie plague in The Walking Dead and its spin-off for many years, James finds himself imagining the worst.\n\n\u201cWell, one of the things I get from the shows is how selfish and broken and destructive and desperate people can get,\u201d he says. That scares him, \u201cbut the overriding message from both is about how people strive to survive and continue and re-form in some way as society, as community and family. They\u2019re about the resilience of the human spirit.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true, too, of Save Me, which James created, wrote and stars in as Nelson \u201cNelly\u201d Rowe, a womanising ne\u2019er-do-well, who learns that the 13-year-old daughter he hasn\u2019t seen since she was a toddler has been abducted, possibly by a paedophile ring. He discovers in himself a love and need to find her, which continues into series two. He also finds a sense of community among the regulars of the pub where he DJs. It\u2019s tense and seedy, with a cast that includes Stephen Graham, Suranne Jones and Kerry Godliman."}}
