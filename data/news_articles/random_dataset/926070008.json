The accent is really difficult if you\u2019re not from here. A neutral accent is something northerners have always had to do to get work.\n\n\u201cNow our accent is more popular, why are we not getting the jobs when it is required\u201d.\n\nAnd in what fans saw as a dig at White Lines, Georgia added: \u201cTrying to watch what should be a good series, but completely put off with an accent. I see and hear this so much.\u201d\n\n(Image: Netflix)\n\nThe drama follows Zoe (Haddock), who leaves her comfortable life in Manchester for Ibiza to find out what happened to her brother, whose body is discovered 20 years after he went missing.\n\nIt also stars Daniel Mays from Essex as DJ Marcus.\n\nDespite all of the key characters being Mancunian, none of the cast is from the city. Angela Griffin, who also stars, was born in Leeds.\n\nViewers also criticised the accents.\n\n(Image: Netflix)\n\nJennie Sunflower said of Inbetweeners star Haddock, 34: \u201cStarted watching White Lines because I want to be in Spain but Will\u2019s lass from The Inbetweeners Movie is doing the WORST Manc accent I\u2019ve ever heard. Why didn\u2019t they just cast someone from Manchester?\u201d\n\nAnother said: \u201cStill having to endure White Lines on Netflix, the Mancunian lead character now has a Yorkshire accent, a Romanian dealer has a Russian accent. I\u2019m half expecting a French policeman to turn up and announce he\u2019s \u2018just p*ssing through\u2019.\u201d\n\nAnother viewer added: \u201cTwo episodes in of White Lines. Quite possibly the worst thing I\u2019ve seen for yonks.\n\n\u201cCliched, ridiculous nonsense with some of the most laughable accents, and acting going.\u201d"}}
