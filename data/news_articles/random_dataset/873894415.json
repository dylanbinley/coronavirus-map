If the work\u00ading class is going to address cli\u00admate change, we\u2019re going to have to break some rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s def\u00adi\u00adnite\u00adly worth sup\u00adport\u00ading the cli\u00admate strike,\u201d he con\u00adtin\u00adued, \u200b\u201cbut the crux of the mat\u00adter is that busi\u00adness as usu\u00adal can\u00adnot con\u00adtin\u00adue. As long as we engage in actions that don\u2019t dis\u00adrupt the sta\u00adtus quo, it will be easy to ignore. Strikes are the most dis\u00adrup\u00adtive action you can do in society.\u201d\n\nRober\u00adto Jesus Clack, the asso\u00adciate direc\u00adtor of Ware\u00adhouse Work\u00aders for Jus\u00adtice, told In These Times that he thinks Brooks\u2019 cri\u00adtique has mer\u00adit, and empha\u00adsized the col\u00adlec\u00adtive action of the cli\u00admate strike is still mean\u00ading\u00adful. \u200b\u201cThe rea\u00adson we\u2019re jump\u00ading on this is we want to agi\u00adtate the labor move\u00adment to take this more seri\u00adous\u00adly. It\u2019s still an agi\u00adta\u00adtion of the work\u00aders in the work\u00adplace around cli\u00admate change.\u201d\n\nFor some, the cli\u00admate strike is an oppor\u00adtu\u00adni\u00adty to build towards a tra\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adal labor strike. Mar\u00adtinez of UE Local 255 told In These Times, \u200b\u201cIf we, as work\u00aders, are seek\u00ading a true just tran\u00adsi\u00adtion, we must demand it through all means pos\u00adsi\u00adble. And although the upcom\u00ading cli\u00admate strike is not like your tra\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adal labor strike, as to stop pro\u00adduc\u00adtion, it has the pow\u00ader to get there and I envi\u00adsion and hope it will. When we real\u00adize the pow\u00ader to cre\u00adate change is with\u00adin us all, unit\u00aded we become unstoppable.\u201d\n\nThere are signs that some work\u00aders are gear\u00ading up for a con\u00adfronta\u00adtion with their boss\u00ades, although it\u2019s dif\u00adfi\u00adcult to know exact\u00adly how many will with\u00adhold their labor. About 700 Google tech work\u00aders, in addi\u00adtion to Microsoft employ\u00adees, are plan\u00adning to walk off the job on Sep\u00adtem\u00adber 20, along with over 1,500 Ama\u00adzon employ\u00adees, most of them in Seattle.\n\nBezos appears to be feel\u00ading the heat. The morn\u00ading of Sep\u00adtem\u00adber 19, he announced a cli\u00admate pledge, which Ama\u00adzon describes as \u200b\u201ca com\u00admit\u00adment to meet the Paris Agree\u00adment 10 years ear\u00adly.\u201d Accord\u00ading to a com\u00adpa\u00adny press release, this includes a com\u00admit\u00adment to \u200b\u201cnet zero car\u00adbon by 2040 and 100% renew\u00adable ener\u00adgy by 2030.\u201d\n\nBut Ama\u00adzon Employ\u00adees for Cli\u00admate Jus\u00adtice, the group coor\u00addi\u00adnat\u00ading the work action, said in a press state\u00adment that the strike is still on. \u200b\u201cAmazon\u2019s new\u00adly-announced \u200b\u2018Cli\u00admate Pledge\u2019 is a huge win for Ama\u00adzon Employ\u00adees for Cli\u00admate Jus\u00adtice, and we\u2019re thrilled at what work\u00aders been able to achieve in less than a year,\u201d said the group. \u200b\u201cBut we know it\u2019s not enough. The Paris Agree\u00adment, by itself, won\u2019t get us to a liv\u00adable world. Today, we cel\u00ade\u00adbrate. Tomor\u00adrow, we\u2019ll be in the streets to con\u00adtin\u00adue the fight for a liv\u00adable future.\u201d"}}
