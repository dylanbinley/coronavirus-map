Whole Foods made a similar decision as well.\n\nAt the Capitol Thursday, state Representative Michael Schraa (R-Oshkosh) asked Tim Metcalfe, of Madison-based Metcalfe\u2019s Markets, whether his stores will follow suit. \u201cIf they don\u2019t come with a mask, can they not come in? Is your store going to offer them a mask, or have one for sale?\u201d\n\nMetcalfe said for now, masks are not required, but if that changes, stores will sell them at customer service. \u201cWe would probably, if they couldn\u2019t afford to buy one or didn\u2019t want to buy one, we would probably just give them one and let them in the store, and not create that confrontation. That\u2019s a decision that we\u2019ve yet to make.\u201d\n\nMetcalfe\u2019s operates three grocery stores, two in Madison and one in Wauwatosa."}}
