Buttigieg's campaign held similar donor retreats ahead of the Democratic National Committee's first presidential debate in June and the Polk County Steak Fry, an Iowa political tradition, in September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButtigieg, a fundraising juggernaut in 2019, has leaned on high-dollar donors to help fuel his campaign, bringing in more than $19 million during the third quarter \u2014 though he has also raised significant money in smaller amounts online. Buttigieg is getting about twice as much support in polls of Iowa caucusgoers as he is in national Democratic primary surveys, and the South Bend, Ind., mayor\u2019s campaign rushed to build out a big, on-the-ground campaign infrastructure in Iowa this fall."}}
