People still need to eat \u2013 here, in the UK and across Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the midst of the current crisis, I can\u2019t see meat being imported from China and Brazil into the UK and mainland Europe. You would, therefore, imagine that there could be big demand for high-quality, Irish meat.\n\nIn the meanwhile, bills still need to be paid. Farmers in every sector need to be protected. They, like anyone else, can also fall prey to Covid-19\u2026and become ill.\n\nFarming is an \u2018essential service\u2019. Measures must be put in place to deal with the financial impact if a farmer needs to hire somebody to do his or her work. Unless such measures are put in place, there will be too much pressure \u2013 both financially and mentally \u2013 on farmers!\n\nA surge is forecast with regard to this pandemic. It looks like things will get worse before they get better; we need to act now.\n\nI \u2013 like others I would imagine \u2013 have emailed my concerns to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I \u2013 like others \u2013 await a favourable response.\n\nFrom Helen O\u2019Sullivan, Co. Cork"}}
