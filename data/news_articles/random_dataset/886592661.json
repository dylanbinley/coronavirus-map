But, based on her recent experience, she suggested recent problems with youth violence are due to poverty within the households and communities where some young people are raised.\n\nMarshall-Harris said: \u201cMany moons ago when we did sociology and the culture of poverty, we said it does not apply in Barbados because we had a culture then when the cane cutters aspired, so they didn\u2019t see themselves as being poor.\n\n\u201cThey saw themselves as socially mobile and their children were socially mobile.\n\n\u201cSo we didn\u2019t understand what sociologists were talking about when they spoke about a culture of poverty, but now I can see it here because I have encountered children and some adults saying to me, \u2018I am from the ghetto, so I can\u2019t do any better and we are actually revelling in that reality\u2019.\n\n\u201cPoverty is not just about having no means. It is the culture of poverty and saying, \u2018you are going to have to forgive me for whatever I do as a result because I can\u2019t do any better.\u2019\u201d\n\nBarbados was culturally a reactionary society in which people primarily sought only to address serious matters after crises, Marshall-Harris suggested, but said there was no better time to engage the services of key professionals whose expertise are currently being grossly underused.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe expensively educate hundreds of people every academic year with the qualifications in psychology and social work without giving them the opportunity to practice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the resources and we\u2019ve got to use them, and we have a need for them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a situation where we are just going to push them into [the school system] to absorb them, but because we now see the absolute need to have the social workers in the schools.\u201d\n\nSafety officers with law enforcement training needed to be employed as well, the child advocate added.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe incipient violence has been there for a while.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we are crisis management people and we are not very proactive in our approach, but I think the time has come to employ all these devices.\n\n\u201cWe also need to not just focus on the school. What happens in school is a product also of what is happening outside the schools.\n\n\u201cThe environment from which our children are proceeding very often is already a violent one, so they bring that into a school.\u201d\n\nMarshall-Harris further pointed out that problems with child violence were not exclusive to Barbados and suggested authorities examine some of the factors influencing youth violence globally.\n\nShe said: \u201cI think it\u2019s because we\u2019re now a global village culturally and for example, Britain is now grappling with excessive incidents of knife crime and that [is] among 14, 15 and 16-year olds as we are beginning to worry about now.\n\n\u201cBarbados is really not in a unique position but at the beginning of a problem which we must look to come to terms with.\u201d\n\nRead our ePaper.
