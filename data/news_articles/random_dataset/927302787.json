We didn\u2019t have people mourning the death of this man, George Floyd. We had people capitalizing. His death is on their hands as much as it is those officers.\u201d\n\nMoore ended up apologizing for his remarks.\n\nLA Mayor Eric Garcetti defended Moore in a press conference on Tuesday: \u201cWhen I heard him say what he said, I knew that he did not mean that. And I know that he corrected it right away. \u2026 That statement is a wrong statement \u2014 that looters are the equivalent of murderers. Looting is wrong, but they are not the moral equivalence. The officers who killed George Floyd are murderers.\u201d\n\nRetired LAPD sergeant Cheryl Dorsey tells KCRW that she believes Moore will not be fired, but as a police chief, he can\u2019t express how he feels.\n\n\u201cHe can't just say what he thinks if that, in fact, is how he feels,\u201d Dorsey says. \u201cShould he be fired? If he feels that way, he\u2019s no different than any other police officer who is operating day-to-day with animus towards a certain group of folks, black folks in this case. And I don't care what rank you are. And so if that's who Mike Moore is, then yeah, he needs to go.\u201d\n\nDorsey is concerned that the motivation behind the protests might be getting lost among the looting and violence. \u201cThere seems to be more chatter about that than about the murder of George Floyd.\u201d\n\nFormer LAPD sergeant Cheryl Dorsey is worried that the motivation behind recent protests might be getting lost amid looting and violence. Photo courtesy of Cheryl Dorsey.\n\nDorsey says the LAPD has improved its tactics when dealing with civil unrest.\n\n\u201cI think the officers have gotten better at dealing with crowds,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile we want to allow people their absolute right to protest peacefully, we can't allow destruction of property, and in some instances, harm to others,\u201d she says.\n\nBut some police officers are pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s appropriate, she says.\n\n\u201cYou can only use that amount of force necessary to overcome resistance, whatever that resistance is. And that's always been our training, not only on the LAPD, but across the nation. And so anytime you have a peaceful protester that you assault with a rubber bullet, I think that's a little excessive,\u201d Dorsey says.\n\nShe hopes there are supervisors near the protests, managing both the demonstration and response by police. She also calls for officers to check on their partners, in case they act out of line.\n\nDorsey, who was an officer during the 1992 Rodney King riots, says working on the frontlines is a source of high tension for police.\n\n\u201cAdrenaline is pumping, and you want to make sure that you\u2019re safe and that you go home safe at the end of this demonstration,\u201d she says.\n\nShe points out the importance of officers approaching protests with an understanding of the situation.\n\n\u201cI think it's important for officers to be able to relate to the people that you're dealing with,\u201d Dorsey says.\n\nYet, she\u2019s critical of the Los Angeles Protective Police League, who she describes as \u201cdefense attorneys for police officers who are in violation of conduct unbecoming of an officer.\u201d\n\nIn the end, she says the bigger issue is the current set of policies supporting the LAPD, such as the police officers\u2019 bill of rights.\n\n\u201cUnless you make those kinds of policy changes, those kinds of legislative changes, then you're going to have police officers continue to do bad deeds, and then run behind the cover and shelter of a police organization, and never actually be dealt with in a way administratively that would deter that bad behavior,\u201d Dorsey says.\n\n\u2014 Written by Danielle Chiriguayo and Amy Ta, produced by Brian Hardzinski"}}
