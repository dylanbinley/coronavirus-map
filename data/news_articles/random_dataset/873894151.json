He told FranceInfo radio: \u201cUnfortunately, the threat level remains unchanged.\u201d The UK Foreign Office has also warned \u201cterrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in France\u201d. M Nu\u00f1ez said \u201chomegrown\u201d jihadists inspired by the Islamic State (Isis) group\u2019s ideology remained the biggest security threat to France, stoking fresh concerns over the organisation\u2019s ability to wield influence even after its territorial defeat in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\u201cThe greatest threat is the so-called homegrown threat by radicalised individuals based in France. These are people who obey ISIS and are inspired by its propaganda,\u201d he said, adding that would-be jihadists were most likely to launch low-tech knife and vehicle attacks.\n\n\n\nUS-backed forces pushed Isis out its remaining territory in March. Hundreds of foreign fighters are now being held in detention camps while western governments try and work out what to do with them. France has so far refused to take back citizens who joined the group\u2019s so-called \u201ccaliphate,\u201d insisting adults captured in Iraq or Syria should face trial locally despite the risk of capital punishment. M Nu\u00f1ez added western states should \u201cremain prudent\u201d amid claims Isis has strengthened its insurgent capabilities in Iraq and is re-surging in Syria.\n\nIt is crucial for western governments to \u201ctrack\u201d their movements, he said. The security chief\u2019s warning echoed a recent, alarming UN report on global terrorism, in which analysts said that Isis could launch a fresh wave of terrorist attacks before the end of the year, including those designed to \u201cexacerbate existing dissent and unrest\u201d in Europe. UN experts on the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee said that Isis officials were currently focused on \u201cadapting, consolidating and creating conditions for an eventual resurgence\u201d despite their recent setbacks. The group, though short on funds, is actively seeking ways to \u201creinvest in the capacity to direct and facilitate complex international attacks,\u201d the July report said.\n\n\u201cThe current abatement of such attacks, therefore, may not last long, possibly not even until the end of 2019,\u201d according to the UN. Isis, which is still worth between \u00a340 million ($50m) and \u00a3240 million ($300m), is using propaganda to maintain its \u201cvirtual caliphate,\u201d the analysts added. The report was based on the intelligence assessments of UN member states. European governments believe that around 5,000 to 6,000 of their citizens travelled to Syria and Iraq to join extremist movements, most of them pledging allegiance to Isis. About a third were killed, while another third are being held in detention or have moved elsewhere. More than 2,000 may have returned to Europe.\n\nAn Isis bomber targeted children in Manchester"}}
