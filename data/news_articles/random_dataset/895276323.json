I\u2019m saying how we raise the money and deploy it to the communities.\n\n\u201cYou want to maintain that volunteer culture. You have paid lifeguards, Monday to Friday on the beach; on weekends, you have volunteers.\u201d\n\nChester said it was a conversation the prime minister had already indicated he was prepared to have, once the immediate danger of the current season had passed.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister has said that having leave for APS employees extended to 20 days is viable,\u201d Chester said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about not paying volunteers every time they turn out, we\u2019re talking about when they get associated with long-term campaign events.\n\n\u201cState government employees are out there side by side, holding hoses with our volunteers, one is getting paid, one is not. Is that sustainable in the long term? I doubt it. The feedback has been quite positive. Notwithstanding there\u2019s some advice saying I\u2019m on the wrong track.\u201d\n\nLabor has been calling for volunteer firefighters to be paid, or offered tax breaks, an idea Scott Morrison has not ruled out but pushed to early next year, when the fire season comes to a close.\n\nAnthony Albanese said it was an issue \u201cwhich does have to be addressed\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had circumstances which really have been going on for some time now and will continue to last for many, many weeks to come,\u201d the opposition leader said on Friday.\n\n\u201cSo, I pay tribute to them. I once again say to the government that they really need to give consideration to providing some form of financial compensation to people who have been \u2026 defending their local communities and making a difference to our country.\u201d\n\nAlbanese said there was precedent for one-off payments.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that in the past the Keating government gave a one-off payment in 1994 for people who\u2019d worked for more than seven days,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a range of measures that could be done. There\u2019s consideration of tax arrangements. There\u2019s consideration of a one-off payment. Leave arrangements could be made.\n\n\u201cI note today that minister Chester is calling for payments to volunteers as well. He says it\u2019s his own view after talking to people in the community. There\u2019s no doubt that if you talk to people in the community, I think the view is very clear that common sense should apply here.\u201d\n\nThe government has announced Australian defence force liaison officers will be stationed at fire control centres across New South Wales to bolster efforts, as well as provide a visible ADF presence to the public, which has been sceptical of the support being offered.\n\nThe liaison officers, which comes on top of heavy machinery and co-ordination support, will also begin planning for the recovery, and clean up, with fires already having burned through an area bigger than the country of Wales, with more to come.\n\nSevere to Extreme heatwave conditions are set to affect much of the state in the next week.

At least 70 fires continue to burn across the state, with 33 considered to be uncontained.\n\nNSW Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told the Seven Network firefighters had been carrying out \u201creally difficult ... challenging work\u201d in areas such as the Blue Mountains and the NSW south coast.\n\n\u201cBecause these fires are large, they\u2019re complex and they\u2019re very prone to the elements, once these weather conditions turn around, we know we\u2019re going to see increased fire activity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo they\u2019re just giving their all to shore up protection and trying to consolidate and contain them as much as they can.\u201d"}}
