Bypassing the expert body in the making of these decisions is therefore not just disrespectful, it\u2019s also irresponsible.\u201d\n\nWomen in Australia are nearly three times as men to experience violence from an intimate partner, while one woman a week, on average, is killed by her current or former partner.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hannah Clarke with her children Aaliyah, Laianah and Trey. Photograph: supplied\n\nAfter the shocking murder of Hannah Clarke and her three children, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said all levels of government and the legal system needed to reflect on how the family was failed.\n\n\u201cI believe state, territory and national governments, all of us, and our agencies and importantly the judiciary, we must all reflect again on these terrible murders,\u201d he told parliament last month.\n\n\u201cWe must reflect on how and where the system failed Hannah and her children, as it has failed so many others. It is so frustrating. It\u2019s so devastating.\u201d\n\nThe issue was raised at the Council of Australian Governments\u2019 meeting, where women\u2019s safety ministers once again met to discuss changes that could be made to the system.\n\nExperts have repeatedly called for increased funding to services and for those affected to have access to financial help that will not cost them down the track, as well as more counselling, accommodation and a more coordinated national response.\n\nThe Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, repeated his calls for a national summit on domestic and family violence on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that there\u2019s a comprehensive plan,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt does require finance. But it also requires listening to the experts.\u201d\n\nIn New Zealand, we are starting to value women's work fairly. It's time for the world to follow Read more\n\nRuston told Sky News on Sunday that while governments were working to address the scourge of violence against women, the community also needed to step up.\n\n\u201cWe should be ashamed of ourselves in Australia that we have the kind of domestic violence perpetration that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut until we can convince everybody in Australia that they have a role to play in stamping out domestic violence \u2013 that\u2019s not just the federal government or state and territory governments, it\u2019s the community, it\u2019s individuals and really encourage men particularly as role models to start stepping up to the plate.\n\n\u201cAnd if you see something that you think is disrespectful behaviour towards women then actually go and call it out for what it is. Because until we change people\u2019s behaviour we\u2019re just going to be responding to domestic violence and we have to start preventing it.\u201d\n\nHannah Clarke and her three young children, Aaliyah, Laianah and Trey will be laid to rest on Monday. The family were killed last month after the children\u2019s father, Hannah\u2019s estranged husband, set fire to his family while they were trapped in their car, before killing himself.\n\nIn Australia, if you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault, domestic or family violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit 1800RESPECT.org.au.
