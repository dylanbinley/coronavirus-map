When they go back to their home dioceses, let them be given an opportunity to talk to the Christians to contribute,\u201d he urged, noting that the spirit has already picked up because, \u201cI know of parishes in Nairobi that are already supporting parishes in Lodwar and Marsabit.\u201d\n\nFr Luchidio who was coordinating a meeting in Nyahururu of Fidei Donum Priests in Kenya, called for a combined effort to avert the challenges faced by those working in hardship areas.\n\n\u201cBeing in very far locations sometimes they are forgotten, and they sometimes feel lonely. Let us not just assume that the priests are doing well, they might be requiring our help so that they don\u2019t feel abandoned,\u201d he stressed.\n\n\u201cThis meeting is to encourage a mission spirit where we look at each other as communion of churches and when this other church is in need let us support them because they are brothers and sisters in Christ,\u201d Fr Luchidio said.\n\nThe meeting held from September 22 to 26 aimed at renewing and sharing personal experiences and ways of overcoming the challenges faced by Fidei Donum priests in Kenya.\n\nFidei Donum priests are diocesan priests sent by their dioceses to help evangelize mission territories away from their home dioceses. Fidei Donum priests contributed towards early evangelization in Kenya especially in dioceses such as Nyahururu, Isiolo, Malindi and Marsabit."}}
