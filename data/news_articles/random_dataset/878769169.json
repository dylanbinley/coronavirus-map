He spoke at the 2006 funeral of former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, who at the time was facing war crimes charges, calling him \u201ca rather tragic man.\u201d\n\nHandke \u2014 who once called for the Nobel Prize to be abolished \u2014 said he was \u201castonished\u201d to receive the literature award.\n\n\u201cI never thought they would choose me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never thought they would choose me,\u201d Handke told reporters outside his home in suburban Paris.\n\n\u201cIt was very courageous by the Swedish academy, this kind of decision,\u201d he added. \u201cThese are good people.\u201d\n\nIf Handke\u2019s victory caused uncomfortable ripples, the choice of Tokarczuk was welcomed by liberal-minded authors and readers in her native Poland and beyond.\n\nThe 57-year-old novelist, known for her humanist themes and playful, subversive streak, has often irked Poland\u2019s populists and conservatives. The academy said she was chosen for works that explore the \u201ccrossing of boundaries as a form of life.\u201d\n\nAlready a major cultural figure in Poland, Tokarczuk has a growing international profile, especially since she won the Booker International prize in 2018 for the novel \u201cFlights.\u201d\n\nShe told Polish broadcaster TVN on Thursday that she was \u201cterribly happy and proud\u201d that her novels, which describe events in small towns in Poland \u201ccan be read as universal and can be important for people around the world.\u201d\n\nHandke has been a big name in European literature for decades, crafting works \u2014 starting with his first novel, \u201cThe Hornets,\u201d in 1966 \u2014 that combine introspection and a provocative streak. One early play was called \u201cOffending the Audience\u201d and featured actors insulting theatergoers.\n\nHe has written screenplays, several of them for German director Wim Wenders, who also filmed Handke\u2019s 1970 novel, \u201cThe Goalie\u2019s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick.\u201d\n\nHe was praised by the Swedish Academy for writing powerfully about catastrophe, notably in \u201cA Sorrow Beyond Dreams,\u201d his 1972 autobiographical novel about his mother\u2019s suicide.\n\nBut his staunch support of the Serbs during the 1990s Balkans wars has set him at odds with many other Western intellectuals.\n\nIn a 1996 essay, \u201cJustice for Serbia,\u201d Handke accused Western news media of always depicting Serbs as aggressors. He denied that genocide was committed when Bosnian Serb troops massacred some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys in the enclave of Srebrenica in 1995, and was an opponent of NATO\u2019s airstrikes against Serbia for that country\u2019s violent crackdown in Kosovo in the late 1990s. In an interview with Serbia\u2019s state TV earlier this year, Handke said those behind the bombing \u201cdon\u2019t belong to Europe and the planet Earth.\u201d\n\nHandke\u2019s views led novelist Salman Rushdie in 1999 to call him a contender for \u201cInternational Moron of the Year.\u201d Rushdie\u2019s publicist at Penguin Random House said Thursday that Rushdie stood by what he wrote in 1999.\n\nNovelist Jennifer Egan, president of PEN America, said the writers\u2019 group deeply regretted the choice of Handke.\n\n\u201cWe are dumbfounded by the selection of a writer who has used his public voice to undercut historical truth and offer public succor to perpetrators of genocide,\u201d she said. \u201cAt a moment of rising nationalism, autocratic leadership, and widespread disinformation around the world, the literary community deserves better than this.\u201d\n\nIn 2006, Handke turned down the Heinrich Heine award from the German city of Duesseldorf after his selection sparked a row among the city\u2019s politicians. His selection as winner of the International Ibsen Award for drama in 2014 also prompted protests from human rights groups.\n\nThat same year, he told the Austrian Press Agency that the Nobel Prize should be abolished because of its \u201cfalse canonization\u201d of literature.\n\nSerbian officials and media hailed Handke on Thursday as a \u201cgreat friend of Serbia,\u201d but Kosovans reacted angrily to his Nobel Prize. Vlora Citaku, Kosovo\u2019s ambassador to the United States, tweeted that \u201cIn a world full of brilliant writers, the Nobel committee chooses to reward a propagator of ethnic hatred & violence. Something has gone terribly wrong!\u201d\n\nAlbanian Foreign Minister Gent Cakaj, who was born in Kosovo, tweeted that the award was \u201can ignoble & shameful act.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, the win by Tokarczuk \u2014 Poland\u2019s fifth Nobel literature laureate \u2014 was greeted with praise even by her erstwhile critics.\n\nTokarcuzk has been attacked by Polish conservatives \u2014 and received death threats \u2014 for criticizing aspects of the country\u2019s past, including its episodes of anti-Semitism. She is also a strong critic of Poland\u2019s current right-wing government.\n\nHer 2014 novel \u201cThe Books of Jacob\u201d tackles the forced conversion of Polish Jews to Catholicism in the 18th century. Her book \u201cDrive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead\u201d is a crime thriller with feminist and animal-rights themes that offers a sometimes unflattering depiction of small-town Polish life.\n\nCulture Minister Piotr Glinski, who said earlier this week that he has not finished any of Tokarczuk\u2019s books, tweeted his congratulations and said he now felt obliged to go back and read her books all the way through.\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda called it a \u201cgreat day for Polish literature.\u201d\n\nTokarczuk is only the 15th woman to win the Nobel literature prize in more than a century. Of the 11 Nobels awarded so far this week, all the other laureates have been men.\n\nBoth literature winners will receive a full cash prize, valued this year at 9 million kronor ($918,000), a gold medal and a diploma at a ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10.\n\nThe literature prize was canceled last year after an exodus of members from the exclusive Swedish Academy following sex abuse allegations. Jean-Claude Arnault, the husband of a former academy member, was convicted last year of two rapes in 2011.\n\nThe Nobel Foundation had warned that another group would award the literature prize if the academy didn\u2019t improve its tarnished image, but said in March it was satisfied the Swedish Academy had revamped itself and restored trust.\n\nThe 2018 and 2019 awards were chosen by the Swedish Academy\u2019s Nobel Committee, a new body made up of four academy members and five \u201cexternal specialists.\u201d Nobel organizers say the committee suggests two names that then must be approved by the Swedish Academy. It\u2019s unclear whether academy members simply rubber-stamped the experts\u2019 choice.\n\nThe literature awards follow Nobel Prizes in physics, chemistry and medicine handed out earlier this week. The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Friday and the economics award on Monday.\n\nLawless reported from London. Associated Press writers Jan M.
