Now that\u2019s the only option.\n\nThe state party recently announced that it has nixed plans for in-person voting at 21 polling sites across Hawaii. The party had already mailed out two rounds of ballots and will now put out a third round as well. They also pushed back the deadline to register to vote in the primary to April 4. The party stressed, \u201cSafety comes first during this challenging time.\u201d\n\nHawaii Democrats says it won\u2019t have primary results until May.\n\nThe Alaska Democratic Party \u2013 which, like Hawaii, is holding a party-run presidential primary \u2013 also scrapped its April 4 in-person voting. The party extended the date a mailed-in ballot needed to be postmarked from March 24 to April 10.\n\nBallots had already been mailed to all Alaska Democrats but the party now says ballots can also bet downloaded from its website.\n\nThe Wyoming Democratic Party\u2019s presidential caucus will also be mail-in only, after they removed the option for people to vote in person. People who registered too late to receive a ballot in the mail will now be mailed a ballot. The deadline to request a replacement ballot has been pushed back to March 31. The party also moved the date by which ballots must be received from April 4 to April 17.\n\nPennsylvania's change\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf\u2019s expected to sign a bill pushing back his state\u2019s presidential primary from April 28 to June 2. Meeting remotely for the first time in history, the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature on Wednesday voted to delay the date of the primary.\n\nA bill passed last year in Pennsylvania gave all voters the ability to vote by mail.\n\nWith 186 Democratic convention delegates up for grabs, Pennsylvania\u2019s the second-largest remaining primary, following New York State.\n\nOhio extends mail-in deadline\n\nOhio lawmakers moved to extend the deadline for mailed-in ballots in that state\u2019s presidential primary through April 28.\n\nThe Ohio primary was originally scheduled for March 17, but on the eve of the contest, Gov. Mike DeWine said it wasn\u2019t safe for voters to head to the polls. While the governor didn\u2019t have the unilateral power to delay the election, the state\u2019s top health official ordered polling places closed without officially moving the date of the primary.\n\nUnder a bill passed by the legislature Wednesday \u2013 which DeWine is expected to sign \u2013 postcards will be sent to every registered voter to explain how they can obtain an absentee ballot. Ballots must be postmarked by April 27 and received by May 8 to be counted. The state will allow an extremely limited group of people \u2013 mostly disabled voters \u2013 to cast a ballot in person.\n\nVoting rights groups argue that the new primary rules would disenfranchise some voters.\n\nWisconsin not moving its date\n\nAs of now, Wisconsin\u2019s primary is still scheduled to be held on April 7.\n\nGov. Tony Evers \u2013 who on Monday issued a stay-at-home order for Wisconsin residents to try and prevent the spread of the coronavirus \u2013 is urging voters to cast ballots by mail.\n\nWisconsin has no-excuse absentee voting, which state officials say are being sent in at a record pace. And there\u2019s also curbside in-person voting in parts of the state.\n\nOn the ballot: many crucial general election contests for mayors and county officials \u2013 as well as the presidential primary.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign announced on Thursday that they\u2019re starting to help education voters in Wisconsin on the mail-in options for the primary.\n\n\u201cOur team has worked quickly to call into Wisconsin and talk to voters about their extended options to register online and request a mail-in ballot. We will seek to grow our delegate lead through remaining primary contests -- and we will do it safely,\u201d Biden campaign manager Jennifer O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote in an email to supporters.\n\nWisconsin is also a crucial general election battleground state and O\u2019Malley Dillon noted that the campaign\u2019s \u201cbeginning to create a general election-ready foundation of engagement across priority states.\u201d\n\nIn the 2016 presidential election, then-GOP nominee Donald Trump narrowly carried Wisconsin and two other reliably blue states \u2013 Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2013 helping him to win the White House.\n\n$400 million to beef up voting by mail\n\nThe massive $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package President Trump is waiting to sign into law upon likely passage by the House of Representatives includes $400 million to help states move toward mail-in voting, amid a pandemic that is forcing many Americans to shelter at home.\n\nThe funds would assist states as they expand voting by mail, early voting, online registration and make in-person voting safer for all.\n\nLawmakers and election advocates are warning that if states don\u2019t receive federal assistance to move away from in-person voting, there could be low turnout and disruptions in November\u2019s general election.\n\nRead the entire story here\n\nKlobuchar\u2019s husband on the mend\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar announced on Thursday that her husband \u2013 who contracted COVID-19 \u2013 is now recovering at the family\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cThanks to all who sent kind words and prayers for my husband John,\u201d the Minnesota Democrat who suspended her presidential campaign earlier this month said in a statement. \u201cHe has coronavirus and has been in the hospital for pneumonia and low oxygen. He took a good turn, was just released and is now recovering at home. Thanks to those who cared for him and for all front line health care workers.\u201d"}}
