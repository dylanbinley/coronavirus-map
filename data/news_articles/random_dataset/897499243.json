This should really be investigated,\u201d said the mayor.\n\nThe mayor said he will be writing to the DTI and the Department of Tourism (DoT) to look into the matter and urge the hotels to be more reasonable with their prices.\n\nHe also said that Air BnB units are directly competing with the hotels as this has become the recent trend.\n\nAlthough the hotels are not fully booked, he still expects many tourists in Cebu during the Sinulog 2020 festivities.\n\n\u201cI implore the hotel owners not to take advantage of the influx of people, make your prices reasonable,\u201d said the mayor.\n\nSupply and demand\n\nCarlo Anton Suarez, president of the Hotel Resort and Restaurant Association of Cebu Inc. (HRRACI), for his part, said that online accommodation application has not only affected their business during Sinulog but whole year round for already four to five years.\n\nSuarez, however, admitted that during peak season, hotel rates would really tend to increase in the principle of supply and demand.\n\n\u201cPositive mahal, pero it\u2019s a matter of supply and demand,\u201d Suarez said.\n\nSuarez also clarified that they are not against Air BnB but only want fair competition through registering their business and getting the necessary permits, and paying their taxes.\n\n\u201cWe are paying our taxes and business permits yearly, yet they are getting the market share,\u201d he said. /bmjo"}}
