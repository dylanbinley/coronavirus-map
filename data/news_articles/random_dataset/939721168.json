It\u2019s also the sort of behaviour that will mean this second wave goes longer than it should,\u201d Mr Andrews said.\n\n\u201cThese rules are binary now \u2013 the curfew is there, permit system is there.\u201d\n\nVictorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos, meanwhile, declared in a late-night Twitter thread on Saturday she had put \u201cevery ounce of energy\u201d since January into halting the spread of COVID-19 in the state, but \u201cif it wasn\u2019t enough, then I\u2019m deeply sorry\u201d.\n\n\u201cLet the independent (hotel quarantine inquiry) judge do her job, let the cards fall where they may. I believe there is nothing to fear in seeking the truth. The truth will set you free,\u201d Ms Mikakos said, adding that civil disorder endangers citizens during a pandemic.\n\nMr Andrews on Sunday said Ms Mikakos was \u201ca very strong person\u201d and that his team would \u201csee this through\u201d.\n\nSix people were also arrested on Sunday outside state parliament in Melbourne for breaching health orders while protesting against the lockdown and then refusing to provide identification to police.\n\nThey were released once they provided identification, and fined $1652 each.\n\nAmong those fined is one of the event\u2019s organisers, who is likely to also be charged."}}
