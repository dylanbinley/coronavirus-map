Hitachi echoed the view, saying no decisions have been made.\n\nHitachi Chemical, established in 1962, makes a wide range of products, including materials for semiconductors and lithium-ion batteries as well as auto parts. The company logged a group net profit of \u00a528.7 billion on sales of \u00a5681.0 billion in the business year through March.\n\nTokyo-based Showa Denko, a manufacturer of various chemical products set up in 1939, posted a group net profit of \u00a5111.5 billion on sales of \u00a5992.1 billion in 2018.\n\nHitachi has been streamlining its businesses, stripping away subsidiaries with low profitability or less relevance to its core IT and infrastructure business, and shedding noncore businesses to re-center its group on manufacturing equipment and services that benefit from internet of things technologies.\n\nIn March, Hitachi sold its car navigation unit Clarion Co. to French auto parts maker Faurecia SA.\n\nHitachi and Honda Motor Co. said last month they will merge four auto parts suppliers under a new company to boost competitiveness.\n\nAs Hitachi shifts its focus toward power grids and data management, it is on track to buy ABB Ltd.\u2019s power grid division for about $6.4 billion after reaching an agreement a year ago in its biggest-ever deal.\n\nThe manufacturer has also said it is considering options for Hitachi High-Technologies Corp., including making the electronics, medical and chipmaking equipment company a wholly owned subsidiary."}}
