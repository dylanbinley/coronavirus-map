Los Angeles has weathered enormous challenges before, and our strength and resilience are this City\u2019s most powerful assets.\u201d\n\nLong Beach Mayor Robert Garcia said his office was working with state officials and other mayors and would be releasing local guidance later related to bars, restaurants, and other state announcements.\n\nNewsom also announced that six people in the state have died of COVID- 19, the disease caused by the virus. The number of those confirmed to have been infected in the state rose to 338 Sunday, a 14 percent increase form the prior day.\n\nThe restrictions on older Californians is due to the fact that they are the group most at-risk for the disease. Sunday\u2019s order says that community members over the age of 65 should enter into a state of home isolation as they are a high-risk group.\n\nWhen pressed about whether he was prepared to enforce the order, Newsom said he didn\u2019t think it would come to that, and expressed confidence that the public, businesses and local governments would follow the directive.\n\nThe governor made it clear, however, that he has the authority to enforce the order if necessary.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll exercise the appropriate authority in consultation with the experts, with an eye on public health and public safety,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe are working in concert, day in and day out, with not just our federal partners but other states, looking at best practices around the world. We have teams that are (conducting) a detailed review of what worked and what didn\u2019t work in China, worked and didn\u2019t work in Singapore, what\u2019s going on in Italy, what\u2019s not going on, based upon some of the headlines. Same with France, same with Spain, we have people on the ground, literally, \u2026 providing real-time information, we have our legal team \u2026 we\u2019re working with the FAA on flights, repatriation \u2026 All this is part of our all-hazards strategies.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis called for calm.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for prevention, not panic,\u201d Holis said after the governor\u2019s announcement. \u201cI urge everyone in Los Angeles County to remain calm as we face the challenge of containing the spread of COVID-19. I want to reassure everyone that LA County public health officials are working diligently to preserve the public\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nNewsom said more guidance would come Tuesday regarding schools that remain open, saying he was especially focused on providing support to low- income families."}}
