Vile.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Poor Meredith Kircher (sic). She didn\u2019t know what was coming.\n\nCalling the post crass, a third person posted: \"Regardless of whether she did it or not a bit crass of Amanda Knox post a 20 year old pic of herself on the flight to Italy....\"\n\nMeredith, who was from south London, was an exchange student in Italy when she died.\n\n(Image: NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images) (Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nRudy Guede was later found guilty of the 21-year-old's sexual assault and murder.\n\nHer heartbroken family suffered a further tragedy this year when her dad John Kercher was killed in a hit-and-run near his home.\n\nThe 77-year-old, who worked as a newspaper journalist for 40 years, working for the Daily Mirror for many years and also writing for The Sun, died on January 18 - five days after he was injured.\n\nSpeaking in his book about his \"beautiful, intelligent and caring\" daughter following her death, Mr Kercher spoke of the family's anguish over the spotlight that had focused on Knox, writing: \"It has seemed as if Meredith has been all but forgotten.\"\n\nHe added: \"My hope is that I can share with the world something of the wonderful girl who was our daughter and sister. I hope our telling the world about the enchanting, generous, kind person that Meredith was can help those whose lives she touched.\"\n\nLast year, 32-year-old Knox, who married for a second time last month, returned to Italy for the first time since her prison release to speak at an event for the Italy Innocence Project."}}
