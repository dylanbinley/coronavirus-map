It has warned governments, seaports, shippers and insurers that they could face measures if they aid the tankers.\n\nAccording to Refinitiv Eikon on Sunday, two Iranian tankers that delivered fuel to Venezuela as part of the flotilla have begun to sail back, as the government in Caracas prepares stations to begin charging for the gasoline.\n\nTensions have spiked between longtime foes Tehran and Washington since 2018, when President Donald Trump exited Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with six major powers and reimposed sanctions on the country that has battered its economy.
