He said that students and workers in major cities would need to get the vaccine, but not those living in sparsely populated rural areas.\n\n\u201cNot all of the 1.4 billion people in our country have to take it,\u201d he said in an interview published Tuesday in the Guangming Daily.\n\nSinoPharm, which has two vaccines in trial, has an annual manufacturing capacity of 220 million doses, Liu said.\n\nLiu, who is also the company\u2019s Communist Party secretary, told the paper that he had been injected with the vaccine. Reports that Chinese researchers and executives have received shots of their vaccines have raised ethical questions in some scientific circles.\n\n___\n\nHERE\u2019S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:\n\n\u2014 Report: U.S. nursing home cases up nearly 80% in COVID-19 rebound\n\n\u2014 Washington's National Zoo awaits birth of pandemic panda cub\n\n\u2014 Pandemic reshaping air travel as carriers struggle\n\n\u2014 Universities scramble to deal with virus outbreaks\n\n___\n\n\u2014 Follow AP\u2019s pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\n___\n\nHERE\u2019S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:\n\nNEW DELHI \u2014 India reported more than 55,000 new cases on Tuesday, putting its total virus caseload past 2.7 million.\n\nIndia has the third-most cases, behind the U.S. and Brazil. It also has the fourth-most deaths from the coronavirus, with 51,797.\n\nBut India's deaths per million people stands at 34 \u2014 far lower than what has been reported in some North American and European countries.\n\nIndia has been recording at least 50,000 new infections per day since mid-July as the disease has spread from cities like Mumbai and New Delhi into densely populated states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.\n\n___\n\nJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 The World Health Organization says countries in the Western Pacific \u2014 a vast region comprising nearly 1.9 billion people \u2014 have entered a new phase of coronavirus pandemic response and urged regional governments to continue to promote behavior that protects community health.\n\nThis is \u201cthe phase where governments will need to deal with multiple increases or surges, but in a sustainable way,\u201d said Dr. Takeshi Kasai, the WHO\u2019s regional director for the Western Pacific.\n\nHe said governments will need to have earlier targeted responses to outbreaks, continue to improve health care systems, and promote healthy \u201cnew normal\u201d habits that will help prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cApproaches like this could be more effective and minimize social disruptions and impact on economies,\u201d Kasai said.\n\nThe WHO also warned that countries in the region \u2014 including Australia, the Philippines and Japan \u2014 are reporting increasing numbers of people under 40 contracting the virus.\n\n\u201cMany are unaware they are infected with very mild symptoms, or none at all,\u201d Kasai said. \u201cThis can result in them unknowingly passing on the virus to others.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 An epidemiologist told an inquiry on Tuesday that almost all of a second wave of coronavirus infections in Australia\u2019s hard-hit Victoria state can be traced back to returned travelers in two Melbourne hotels.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services epidemiologist Charles Alpren was testifying at a state government-appointed inquiry into failures in a quarantine system that required Australians returning from overseas to isolate in Melbourne hotels for two weeks.\n\nAlpren said \u201c99%\u201d of Victoria\u2019s current coronavirus infections were linked to the Rydges on Swanston and Stamford Plaza hotels.\n\nHe said the Rydges outbreak started with a family of four who returned from overseas on May 9.\n\nSome 46 workers from the Stamford Plaza and their close contacts were found to have caught COVID-19 from a man who returned from overseas on June 1 and a couple who returned on June 11, Alpren said.\n\nMelbourne has been locked down for a second time due to the second wave of infections that has resulted in as many as 725 new cases and 25 deaths in a day.\n\n___\n\nMANILA, Philippines -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has decided to ease a mild lockdown in the capital and four outlying provinces to further reopen the country\u2019s battered economy in a high-risk gamble despite having the highest number of coronavirus infections in Southeast Asia.\n\nDuterte\u2019s decision, which he announced late Monday, would allow most businesses, including shopping malls and dine-in restaurants, and Roman Catholic church services to partially resume on Wednesday with restrictions, including the wearing of face masks and keeping people safely apart.\n\nDuterte shifted metropolitan Manila and the nearby provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna and Rizal, a region of about 25 million people, back to a mild lockdown two weeks ago after leading groups of doctors warned hospitals were being overwhelmed again by COVID-19 patients and pleaded for a \u201ctime out.\u201d They also asked the government to recalibrate its response to the pandemic.\n\nThe Philippines has reported more than 164,000 of confirmed cases, including 2,681 deaths.\n\nDuterte\u2019s administration has been under intense pressure to revive the economy after it fell into a recession in the second quarter and millions lost their jobs.\n\n___\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea has reported 246 new cases of the coronavirus, its fifth consecutive day of a triple-digit increase, as the virus continues to spread quickly in the greater capital area where churches have emerged as major clusters.\n\nThe figures announced by South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday pushed the five-day total to 959 and the national caseload to 15,761, including 306 deaths.\n\nThe KCDC said 202 of the new cases were reported from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, home to half of South Korea\u2019s 51 million population, where health workers have been struggling to track transmissions stemming from church gatherings, restaurants, schools and workers.\n\nA northern Seoul church led by a bitter critic of South Korean President Moon Jae-in has emerged as a major cluster of infections, with health workers as of Monday afternoon detecting more than 300 infections linked to its members.\n\n___\n\nMELBOURNE \u2014 Australia\u2019s coronavirus hot spot Victoria state on Tuesday reported its lowest tally of new infections in a month.\n\nVictoria\u2019s Health Department reported 222 news cases, the lowest daily tally since 217 were recorded on July 18.\n\nThe state also reported 17 deaths following a daily record of 25 fatalities on Monday.\n\nInfections have been trending down after a second lockdown came into force in the state capital Melbourne in early August that included a curfew and mandatory mask-wearing.\n\n___\n\nMississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said Monday that he believes voters will be safe going to the polls in person in November for the U.S. presidential elections amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nReeves said those who work in the polls will be required to wear PPE, and voters will need to wear masks and social distance.\n\nIn Mississippi, those over the age of 65 can vote with absentee ballots and those who have a tested positive for coronavirus can get an absentee ballot, provisions that cover the most vulnerable people who will be voting in the election, Reeves said.\n\n\u201cJust simply saying, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go vote in person this year\u2019 is not a reason,\u2019\u201d Reeves said of why someone might apply for an absentee ballot.\n\nOn Sunday, when asked on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d if he is confident all mail-in ballots in the state of Mississippi will be counted in November, Reeves said he\u2019s confident that the ballots that are \u201clegally cast\u201d will be counted.\n\nDuring a press briefing Monday, Reeves said he understands \u201cit\u2019s kind of the neat thing\u201d among national media to \u201cfocus on this fight about the U.S. Postal Service, and to attack President Trump because he is opposed to mail-in voting, universal mail-in voting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI simply meant that Mississippi has election laws, and I anticipate that those election laws will be followed \u2013 nothing more, nothing less. If you legally cast a ballot in the state of Mississippi under the laws of our state, I have every belief that our circuit clerks along with our secretary of state and our state elections board, will count every ballot that is legally cast,\u201d he said."}}
