The Star Tribune generally doesn\u2019t name suspects in criminal cases before they have been charged.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, investigators began focusing on the 26-year-old man after reviewing video of the altercation, in which he\u2019s seen punching another man and knocking him to the ground during the melee. He is wearing a distinctive blue sweatshirt, with the words \u201cAsian Crip King\u201d on the front, and the number \u201c357\u201d on the back. The affidavit doesn\u2019t say what role the man, who was out on supervised released at the time, played in the shooting, but refers to him as a \u201cperson of interest.\u201d\n\nHe was later picked up on a parole violation, with jail records showing that he was booked into the county jail on Jan. 2 and then released a week later. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether he has been ruled out as a suspect.\n\n\u201cThe blue hooded sweatshirt worn by (the man) is very distinctive and serves to identify him in the video of the incident,\u201d an investigator wrote in the affidavit. \u201cIt also contains a reference to a gang affiliation and information obtained in the investigation of this shooting has indicated it was gang-related.\u201d\n\nThe affidavit was in support of a warrant to search the man\u2019s north Minneapolis home.\n\nThe shooting happened just after midnight Dec. 22 \u2014 the same night that the club hosted a rap concert headlined by California rapper $tupid Young.\n\n\u201cPrayers to the ones who got hurt. I appreciate you,\u201d the artist later posted on Instagram.\n\nPolice say that 19-year-old Chai Yang, of St. Paul was killed in the shooting, and seven others, ages ranging from 19 to 37, sustained noncritical injuries.\n\nStaff writer Kim Hyatt contributed to this report."}}
