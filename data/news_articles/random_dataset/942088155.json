It cites Tehran\u2019s breach of the agreement by its continued attempts to enrich uranium.\n\nThe ballistic missile named after Qassem Suleimani is being tested in an undisclosed location in Iran.

Wana via Reuters\n\nBut America withdrew from the JCPOA two years ago, which European leaders say makes its \u201csnapback\u201d attempt invalid.\n\n\u201cThe US ceased to be a participant to the JCPOA following their withdrawal from the deal on May, 8 2018. We cannot, therefore, support this action, which is incompatible with our current efforts to support the JCPOA,\u201d the countries, known as the E3 \u2013 European Three \u2013 said in a statement.\n\nIn what appeared to be a rebuke to the Trump government\u2019s diplomatic efforts, the statement added: \u201cWe call on all UN Security Council members to refrain from any action that would only deepen divisions in the Security Council or that would have serious adverse consequences on its work.\u201d\n\nWashington has become increasingly concerned that the UN vote in October on whether to continue the arms ban will not be supported by other major countries.\n\nIf the embargo is lifted Iran will be able to buy advanced military technology from states such as China and Russia, which could sell it sophisticated surface-to-air missiles, jets and submarines.\n\nReiterating that they remained committed to the JCPOA despite the significant challenges caused by the American withdrawal, the E3 said the priority was to \u201caddress the current issue of systematic Iranian non-compliance with JCPOA\u201d.\n\nTo preserve the agreement, they urged Iran \u201cto reverse all measures inconsistent with its nuclear commitments and return to full compliance without delay.\u201d\n\nThe E3 also pledged to continue to work with the Security Council to continue further diplomatic resolution. \u201cOur efforts will be guided by the need to uphold the authority and integrity of the UN Security Council and to advance regional security and stability.\u201d\n\nThe accord, originally signed by the US, Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia, was a key diplomatic achievement for former president Barack Obama, limiting Iran\u2019s nuclear research in return for ending crippling economic sanctions.\n\nWithin the deal is a provision for the arms embargo, first imposed in 2007, to expire in mid-October this year as long as Iran remains compliant. The embargo now looks likely to expire after the UN refused to back an extension last week. Britain, France and Germany caused further frustration for the Trump administration at the time by abstaining from the vote.\n\nMr Pompeo traveled on Thursday to New York to hand-deliver a letter to the president of the UN Security Council saying Iran isn\u2019t complying with its obligations under the 2015 nuclear deal \u201cdespite extensive efforts and exhaustive diplomacy\u201d.\n\nWashington contends that the notification starts a 31-day clock that will end with the council required to \u201csnap back\u201d sanctions on Iran. It puts the administration on a collision course with other world powers who say the U.S. doesn\u2019t have the standing to invoke the sanctions provision because President Donald Trump quit the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\n\nI take note of today\u2019s announcement by the US. US unilaterally ceased participation in #JCPOA on 8 May 2018. It can not, therefore, be considered to be a JCPOA participant for the purposes of possible sanctions snapback foreseen by UNSC resolution 2231https://t.co/tVC5W8MbJ2 \u2014 Josep Borrell Fontelles (@JosepBorrellF) August 20, 2020\n\n\u201cIn the end they provided no alternatives, no options,\u201d Mr Pompeo said of America\u2019s European allies, adding that they \u201cchose to side with the ayatollahs\u201d and put their own citizens at risk. \u201cAmerica won\u2019t join in this failure of leadership. America will not appease, America will lead.\u201d\n\nCommentators believe that the sanctions issue is likely to be delayed until after the US presidential election in November."}}
