Credit:Kate Geraghty\n\nAbout 10 residents were evacuated from a three-storey building at Green Trees, which is directly above the WestConnex tunnels, in the early hours of Friday morning, after about five floor tiles in a ground unit popped up, creating a noise. Minor cracking in a wall was also discovered."}}
