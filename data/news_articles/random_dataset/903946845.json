Except for White American hostility and racisms toward Black, most if not all of the hatred been against \u201cJews\u201d mainly in White Christian Europe.\n\nThroughout history, Arabs/Muslims and Jews relations not ideal or perfect but acceptance and partnership. Jews, Arabs, and Muslims have lived in relative harmony for centuries going back to the first centuries AD and continued till the early fifties and the establishment of Israel.\n\nThe highlight of which was the order of the Caliphate Omar on his first visit to Jerusalem to allow the Jews to come back and return to Jerusalem after being banned by Christian Byzantine.\n\nFrom Morocco in the West to Kazakhstan in the East, the Jews have lived in harmony and prosperity and were critical partners in commerce, trade, individual intellectual and artistic life, and played a crucial role in helping and establishing new Muslim bureaucracy and legal system in Umayyad Caliphate. Perhaps the Golden Age for both Arabs/Muslims and Jews was Muslim Spain.\n\nIn contract, Europe throughput history has shown utter contempt and hate for Jews from England in the West to Russia in the East. Expulsion, inquisition, pogroms, and Holocaust were the trademark of Christian Europe. So why American Jewish Zionists are so full of hate, racism, and contempt for Arabs and Muslims?\n\nEven in Palestine, ancient and modern, Jews, Arabs, Muslims, and Christians lived in relative harmony and partnership for centuries, and there were NO incidents of ugly hate or racism or Anti-Semitism as we have seen in Europe or the US.\n\nWith the start of the Zionist colonization of Palestine by European secular Jews and the establishment of armed \u201cZionist Settlements,\u201d the Palestinians at first did not think much of the newcomers.\n\nUnlike other European colonial settlers who were out to loot the wealth of these colonies, the European Zionist settlers were intent on the ethnic cleansing of Palestine from its indigenous population.\n\nThe conflict began when it became clear the newcomers are not coming as partners to share Palestine, or escape the Pogroms of Russia, but are out to establish a nationalistic Zionists state with plans for the ethnic cleansing of the indigenous population.\n\nWell-armed, well-funded, and well organized, they began to undertake and resort to acts of terrorism from the bombing of markets to hotels to mass murder. Terrorism in the Arab and modern the Middle East was born in Palestine by these new European Zionist Jewish settlers.\n\nThere was hardly retaliation against this armed colonizer except for Hebron when scores of Zionist Jews were killed. The number of Palestinians slaughtered and butchered by Zionist settlers far exceed anything done by poorly organized Palestinian with no history of carrying arms.\n\nIt is not the nature of Palestinians to be racists or engage in acts of racism since Palestine throughout history was a beautiful mosaic of culture, ethnicity, and religion, even now.\n\nThat is not the case with these European Zionist settlers who grew up in angry hostile and racists Europe suffering from Anti-Semitisms for centuries. So for them, it was so easy to engage in terrorist acts in Palestine, in answer to what they failed to do in Europe for centuries.\n\nThe \u201cDeal of the Century\u201d shows the contempt and hate not only of the majority of Israelis but within the mainstream of American Jewish Zionism. Too bad for Judaism, it deserves better than that. Too bad for the world and certainly too bad for Palestine and the Palestinians.\n\nPartial Listing of Jewish Zionist Terrorism: Zionist Political Violence\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nJune 30, 1924 \u2013 Dutch Jew Jacob Isra\u00ebl de Haan was assassinated by Avraham Tehomi on the orders of Haganah leader Yitzhak Ben-Zvi[39] for his anti-Zionist political activities and contacts with Arab leaders.\n\nDutch Jew Jacob Isra\u00ebl de Haan was assassinated by Avraham Tehomi on the orders of Haganah leader Yitzhak Ben-Zvi[39] for his anti-Zionist political activities and contacts with Arab leaders. 1937\u20131939 \u2013 The Irgun conducted a campaign of violence against Palestinian Arab civilians resulting in the deaths of at least 250.\n\nThe Irgun conducted a campaign of violence against Palestinian Arab civilians resulting in the deaths of at least 250.
