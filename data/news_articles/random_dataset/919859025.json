It is at once surreal and catastrophic.\u0094\n\nChubb\u0092s net income was $252 million for the first three months of the year, down from $1.04 billion in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nThe main driver of the fall in profit was financial market volatility. Property and casualty net premiums written were $7.3 billion, up 8.9 per cent year over year.\n\nThe combined ratio \u0097 the proportion of premium dollars spent on claims and expanses \u0097 for P&C business was 89.1 per cent, in line with 89.2 per cent recorded in the prior year.\n\nInsurers are facing a looming threat as legislators in some US states, including New Jersey and Massachusetts, consider law changes that would require insurers to pay out business-interruption losses for small firms, sometimes even if the policy explicitly excluded losses caused by a virus.\n\nMr Greenberg has called the retroactive measures \u0093unconstitutional\u0094 as they would force insures to pay out for losses they did not contemplate when pricing the policies.\n\nMr Greenberg added: \u0093I feel more stability outside the United States on the regulatory and legal front than I do in the United States. The irony.\u0094"}}
