Now that it\u2019s beginning again, crew members are clad in PPE, and common wisdom has dictated that actors are safest if they are socially distant even as they film \u2014 posing a challenge for fight scenes and love scenes.\n\nBut the television show \u201cShtisel\u201d \u2014 the hit Israeli drama about an ultra Orthodox family in Jerusalem, which began shooting a nine-episode third season earlier this summer \u2014 doesn\u2019t have to change any of its already modest material. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Shtisel,\u2019 you know?\u201d said the show\u2019s breakout star Shira Haas. \u201cThere are not a lot of scenes of touching and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nHaas, 25, was recently nominated for an Emmy for actress in a limited series for Netflix\u2019s \u201cUnorthodox,\u201d which received eight nominations in total. But playing Ruchami Weiss on \u201cShtisel\u201d was her second on-screen role \u2014 one she took on during her final year of high school. When speaking with Variety for a Power of Young Hollywood cover story, Haas talked about her affection for the show.\n\nHaas said she \u201cgave up the idea of a third season,\u201d but was thrilled to be proven wrong. \u201cI mean, we shot the second season \u2014 the last one \u2014 five years ago. But to go back to it, and to be Ruchami again, is amazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cShtisel\u201d creators Ori Elon and Yehonatan Indursky conceived of Ruchami after producer Dikla Barkai said the show didn\u2019t have enough women characters on it. Barkai told Variety over email that Elon and Indursky \u201cunderstood it immediately,\u201d and came up with Ruchami.\n\n\u201cThe combination of Shira and the character was magical,\u201d Barkai said. \u201cShira understood something very deep about Ruchami\u2026 I think that both of them, Shira and Ruchami, are full of belief, and they will do anything (anything means a lot!) for what they believe in.\u201d\n\n\u201cShtisel\u201d \u2014 produced by Yes Studios and the Fremantle label Abot Hameiri \u2014 ran on Yes TV on Israeli television for two seasons in 2013 and 2015-16, winning a number of awards from the Israeli Television Academy (the country\u2019s equivalent of the Emmys). In December 2018, Netflix started streaming the show, making \u201cShtisel\u201d a global phenomenon, and sparking a third season.\n\nUntil then, even the creative team had given up on doing a third season, Barkai said: \u201cBut then it was aired on Netflix, and we couldn\u2019t believe the international embrace that the show got. We were thrilled by the response on the social media, and the reviews we read on the leading magazines. Neither Yes (the Israeli channel) nor we (the producers) could stand aside \u2014 we had to get everybody together and to create another season, and I\u2019m so glad we did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShtisel\u201d was nearly a victim of its own success, though, as one of its delays was because in spring 2019, the Israeli Actors Association asked the cast not to sign new contracts unless they were fairly compensated, since the show had become a big international hit. By the end of the year, that problem was fixed: Barkai told Jewish News in December that the labor dispute had been resolved, saying, \u201cWe solved that and we are good.\u201d\n\nHaas said the labor clash hadn\u2019t been the only cause of delay: \u201cThe writing process took forever, and bringing everyone together again. But everyone really wanted to do it.\u201d\n\nThe show is being shot in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv under strict COVID-19 protocols. Behind-the-scenes set photos posted on the Yes Studios Facebook page, show the crew in masks. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve been on set since the pandemic,\u201d Haas said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of people on set, and everyone is very careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy to be on set, because it\u2019s very rare in these days \u2014 as we all know \u2014 everywhere,\u201d she continued. \u201cI missed acting so much, and the camera and the crew and everyone \u2014 so I\u2019m very, very happy to go back to my happy place, you know?\u201d\n\nAccording to Barkai, \u201cShtisel\u201d will premiere on Yes by the end of the year, and then will go to Netflix at some point in 2021. When viewers last saw Ruchami, she had willed her parents into accepting her impetuous marriage, though they had been dead set against it. Will the show pick up where it left off, or will it jump into the future?\n\n\u201cI have made the scariest secret contract!\u201d Haas said. \u201cI can\u2019t say anything! I wish, I wish, I wish.\u201d\n\nBarkai could be slightly more forthcoming. \u201cThe story will take place four years after the last season, similar to the real time that passed since our last season,\u201d she said. \u201cOther than that, I can say that Ruchami will have a beautiful story in this season, together with her husband Hanina.\n\nHaas said: \u201cThe first time I read the script, I cried. And I\u2019m not like an easy crier, if that\u2019s how you say it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s very touching, and very beautiful,\u201d she continued. \u201cI read it, and it really brought me back five years ago like it was two months ago. So I want to believe that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter. For the latest news, follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram."}}
