Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert at the council, told investigators that when he brought his concerns to the lawyer, John A. Eisenberg, Mr. Eisenberg and another lawyer at the council quickly made the decision to move the transcript of the phone call into the White House\u2019s most classified computer system, one of the people said, insisting on anonymity to discuss the colonel\u2019s closed-door testimony.\n\nThe disclosures added to the picture of a hasty effort at the White House to lock down the record of what transpired in the now-famous July 25 call, amid alarm among officials there about the conversation in which Mr. Trump asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading political rival, and Mr. Biden\u2019s family. The new details of Colonel Vindman\u2019s testimony were first reported by Politico.\n\nTimothy Morrison, another National Security Council official, also testified on Thursday that he consulted Mr. Eisenberg in the aftermath of the call, concerned that, while he did not believe it contained anything illegal, its disclosure could lead to damaging consequences."}}
