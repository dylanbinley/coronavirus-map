This is notable because four out of five kids who have used tobacco started with a flavored product.\n\nThe bill also taxes tobacco vaping products at the same rate as cigarettes, increases retailer fines for sales to minors, and provides for insurance-covered cessation tools. Having already passed the House, it now heads to Gov. Charlie Baker\u2019s desk.\n\nU.S. PIRG End the Nicotine Trap Campaign Director Matt Wellington released the following statement applauding the act\u2019s passage:\n\n\u201cThe legislation, championed by State Sen. John Keenan and State Rep. Danielle Gregoire, would make Massachusetts the first state to ban all flavored tobacco products, which hook kids and drag them into a potentially life-long struggle with nicotine addiction.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, when it comes to youth tobacco use, vaping is proving that history can repeat itself. But Massachusetts\u2019 legislators are showing us the way forward to fight this scourge. The critical reforms in this bill will protect our children\u2019s health from the e-cigarette epidemic that is currently choking our country. We urge Governor Baker to sign it into law immediately.\n\n\u201cOther states should follow Massachusetts\u2019 lead in combating the youth vaping epidemic by prohibiting the sale of all flavored tobacco products.\u201d\n\n###\n\nU.S. PIRG is the federation of state Public Interest Research Groups.
