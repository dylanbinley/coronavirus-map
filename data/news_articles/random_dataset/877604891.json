He\u2019s no longer just about Kanye", "TEXT": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Kanye West didn\u2019t start performing at his \u201cSunday Service\u201d until 1:35 p.m. \u2014 an hour and a half into the worship event. He took the microphone in his hand as the bass boomed behind him. Fans roared under a light blue sky with few clouds and a cool wind breeze.\n\nAs soon as he began to speak, someone shouted, \u201cThank you, Kanye!\u201d\n\nKanye responded, \u201cWho said \u2018Thank you, Kanye?\u2019 I want you to say is \u2018Thank you, Jesus.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe crowd roared in approval. They had been waiting all morning for him, and were happy to cheer for him. West, who has been touring the nation with these events, only performed one song \u2014 \u201cJesus Walks,\u201d one of his biggest hits \u2014 during his brief appearance at The Gateway in Salt Lake City Saturday.\n\nSunday Service happened on a rather particular Saturday in Salt Lake City \u2014 the same day as the 189th Semiannual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Salt Lake City was already bubbling with a religious thought and mood, fans said at the event.\n\nSomewhere between 7,000 and 10,000 people attended the event. Fans first lined up at 4 a.m. Students from universities packed Salt Lake City\u2019s public transportation system en route to the show. Many sauntered in around 9 a.m. \u2014 two hours before the worship service kicked off. Fans leaned on barriers to see the stage. About 9:50 a.m., the gates opened and fans rushed the stage from three different entrances. It was pure chaos.\n\nWATCH: A mad rush to the stage for Kanye West\u2019s #SundayService in Salt Lake City.

Social media is designed to make you think slower. ... They want to slow you down and control you.\u201d\n\nWest talked about politics, too, referencing how the Republican Party of Lincoln freed the slaved and how he supports President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t never make a decision based only on my color,\u201d West said. \u201cThat\u2019s a form of slavery \u2014 mental slavery. I ain\u2019t drink from the white person fountain. ... I ain\u2019t playing with them. All these mind controllers, the media, all of these mind controllers. I find that wherever Christ is where I\u2019ve got my mind at. We find that the love of Christ is where I\u2019ve got my mind back,\u201d he said.\n\nKanye West At Sunday Service Salt Lake City talked about the Republican Party of Lincoln freeing the slaves and how he supports Trump: \u201cI ain\u2019t never made a decision only based on my color. That\u2019s a form of slavery, mental slavery.\u201d pic.twitter.com/0Cwom01ipF \u2014 Hunter Schwarz (@hunterschwarz) October 5, 2019\n\nAnd West said it\u2019s important to focus on more than yourself and God. Focus less on multiple gods \u2014 like fame, money and power. Focus on the one true God, he said.\n\nThough he rhymed a few lines together here and there, West\u2019s Sunday Service event ended on a whimper. He disappeared to wherever he emerged from. The Sunday Service Collective \u2014 which performed throughout much of the morning \u2014 ended the show. People floated away, confused and a little let down.\n\nBut the message was clear \u2014 Kanye is praising Jesus, God and bringing religion to wherever he goes. The new Kanye is not about Kanye. He\u2019s about Jesus Christ, God and observing your faith to make yourself happier.\n\nOne attendee, Mike In, said he attended the show to see West because he loves his music \u2014 and because it was free. He thought about traveling to Cody, Wyoming, for a show. But he didn\u2019t make it. Still, he said the \u201creligious vibes\u201d of Salt Lake City this weekend made it a fascinating show. But it\u2019s cool that West\u2019s Sunday Service is happening on a Saturday in Salt Lake City, he said.\n\nThe event came together at the last minute. Salt Lake police officer William Caycho, who helped watch over the event, said police were told to expect between 4,000 and 7,000 people. They were told last minute to attend.\n\nSalt Lake City only approved permits for the event on Friday, according to Matthew Rojas, spokesman for Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski.\n\nA spokeswoman for The Gateway told the Deseret News that it learned about the event at the last minute, too.\n\nGreg Zitting, 23, said he and his brothers were hanging out Friday night when they heard West was going to perform in Salt Lake City. His younger brother is the bigger fan. So Zitting came with a \u201ccrew\u201d of people.\u201d He seemed unsure if he would attend a similar show again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to see him because of the venue,\u201d Zitting said. \u201cBut it\u2019s Kanye, you know?\u201d\n\nWest has been traveling the country for his Sunday Service events. It began on Jan. 6, 2019, and the location changes every week. He has visited Chicago; Dayton, Ohio; Burbank and Calabasas, Calif.; and Los Angeles. A choir travels with him.\n\nMost recently, he held one of them in Cody, Wyoming, where West and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, own a ranch. He performed in New York City, too.\n\n\u201cI like (the Sunday Service) mainly because it\u2019s what he seems he wants to do,\u201d Zitting, of Draper, said. \u201cYou can tell when an artist is making art and it\u2019s genuine from their heart. And it seems that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nWest\u2019s Sunday Service comes as he prepares to launch a new album, called \u201cJesus Is King.\u201d The album will take on a religious tone, something unsurprising given his recent run of Sunday Service events. The album won\u2019t have any swears, according to reports, and focus more on the power of God and religion rather than money, power and success \u2014 the staples of recent Kanye West music.\n\n\u201cThis has been an incredible journey,\u201d West told the crowd at the event in New York City when playing much of the new music.\n\n\u201cBy having the luxury of having an amazing choir around me every Sunday,\u201d he continued, \u201cI came to know the truth and the joy of Jesus Christ. This album has been made to be an expression of the gospel and to share the gospel and the truth of what Jesus has done to me. When I think of the goodness of Jesus and all that he does for me, my soul cries out.\u201d\n\nBut critics remain uncertain about whether or not West is being genuine with his worship events and his focus on religion and faith. He has duped people before with many other public relations stunts. And one of his previous albums, called \u201cYeezus,\u201d rarely focused on religion.\n\nWest has come under scrutiny for his Sunday Services events, which have been celebrity filled worship events throughout this entire year, as the Deseret News reported in May. He held a massive Sunday Service event during Easter with celebrities all wearing the same colors. West sold sweatshirts for $225 and socks for $50, as reported by the Deseret News\u2019 Emily Hoeven.\n\n\u201cThe obvious explanation for Sunday Service is that it\u2019s album promotion,\u201d Jia Tolentino wrote in The New Yorker\n\n\u201cWhat is the brand?\u201d asked Richard Flory, senior director of research and evaluation at the University of Southern California\u2019s Center for Religion and Civic Culture, as reported by the Deseret News in May. \u201cIs it the object, or the internal text of the Bible? Is it Kanye, or is it, \u2018Let\u2019s get people back to church?\u2019\u201d\n\nA timelapse video of the crowd at Kanye West\u2019s #SundayService in Salt Lake City. pic.twitter.com/K9EfHLzzVu \u2014 Herb Scribner (@HerbScribner) October 5, 2019\n\nBut, in a way, the Sunday Service is West\u2019s return to what made him successful in the first place. One of his first hit singles, and arguably one of his best songs, \u201cJesus Walks,\u201d speaks to his search for a greater meaning \u2014 a higher power. And it\u2019s not coincidence that he kicked off the show with that song.\n\n\u201cGod show me the way because the devil\u2019s tryin\u2019 to break me down,\u201d he says in the song. \u201cThe only thing that I pray is that my feet don\u2019t fail me now. And I don\u2019t think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs. I want to talk to God, but I\u2019m afraid because we ain\u2019t spoke in so long.\u201d\n\nKanye West has always been on this spiritual journey. He\u2019s only now bringing it to the rest of the world.\n\nContributing: Court Mann"}}
