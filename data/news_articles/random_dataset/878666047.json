While tensions arise between primary candidates in any race in any party, in this case, the divisions are deepening, even after the frontrunner proposed that all involved sign a \u201cpledge\u201d to support whoever wins.\n\nCongressman Greg Gianforte, Attorney General Tim Fox and Kalispell state Sen. Al Olszewski are vying for the GOP nomination for governor, but even before they announced their respective candidacies, party members began weighing in on what would shape up to be a formidable field. In early June, as rumors swirled that Gianforte might enter the race, three current and former chairs of Republican central committees published an op-ed in several newspapers across the state asking him to instead defend his congressional seat.\n\n\u201cIf Gianforte chooses not to run as the incumbent for Congress,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cthe subsequent \u2018Republican shuffle\u2019 creates a strong likelihood that Democrats will regain power in our state.\u201d\n\nThe appeal was for naught, as Gianforte announced days later that he would abandon his congressional seat to seek the governorship \u2014 his fourth statewide campaign in five years. Subsequently, the Republican shuffle commenced.\n\nSecretary of State Corey Stapleton, who had previously announced he would vacate his position to run for governor, left the race to campaign for Gianforte\u2019s seat in the U.S. House. Soon after, State Auditor Matt Rosendale announced he would also vacate his seat to run for Congress \u2014 the third time Rosendale has sought to be part of the state\u2019s congressional delegation.\n\nThe dominoes falling as many predicted they would has drawn the ire of many Republicans. But the bitterness is especially pronounced in the race for governor, in which Gianforte and Fox have prodded each other as campaigning has begun in earnest. And the animosity has not gone unnoticed.\n\nLast month, Whitefish resident and Montana Republican Party Chairman Don \u201cK\u201d Kaltschmidt wrote that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that a fellow Republican would include \u201cdisparaging comments about one of our candidates for Governor\u201d in letter to the editor published in the Daily Inter Lake.\n\n\u201cPersonal attacks and the questioning of motives and character only weaken our candidates and hurt us as a Party,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThird parties have also irritated those vying for office. After the Susan B. Anthony List, a pro-life group, endorsed Gianforte for governor in August, Al Olszewski\u2019s wife Nancee expressed her frustration in a letter to the editor. \u201cTo choose sides between three pro-life candidates is unnecessary and is interfering with our state election process,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s not surprising that when Gianforte called for the candidates to sign a unity pledge to endorse the eventual Republican nominee for governor, neither of his opponents jumped at the opportunity.\n\n\u201cParty unity is all about not abandoning Congressman Gianforte\u2019s congressional seat and causing so many people to run for other things,\u201d Fox told Holly Michels of Lee Newspapers.\n\nAdded Olszewski: \u201cIf he\u2019s worried he can\u2019t get support of the party, I\u2019ll sign it if it makes him feel better.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Fox has increasingly sharpened his attacks on Gianforte, pointing out that the Conservative Review and Heritage Action (another conservative group) both gave the congressman an \u201cF\u201d for his \u201cliberal congressional voting record.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a long slog to the 2020 primaries. It appears even longer before the candidates will sign a unity pledge."}}
