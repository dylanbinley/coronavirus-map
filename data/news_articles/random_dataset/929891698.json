If an individual tests positive for the virus, they pose a health risk to others, especially the elderly and those with co-morbidities, thus necessitating self-isolation or quarantine. According to the Health Department, self-isolation is required for a confirmed Covid-19 infection, or for confirmed direct contacts. Quarantine is for possible infections, i.e, those who have come into close contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19 or is awaiting their test results. The period for self-isolation and quarantine is 14 days and symptoms must be monitored daily.\n\nLettie Tsotsetsi was the first Covid-19 patient to have been discharged from the Pinelands isolation facility: \u201cI was very happy really, after my difficult time. I am leaving this place happy; it was like a family, like a home.\u201d\n\nAnneline van Wyk, who also made use of the facility and has since been discharged, added: \u201cI came here to protect my mother. I was very happy here. I didn\u2019t at all feel sick, you made us feel human through it all. I\u2019m very glad I chose to come here.\u201d\n\nThe isolation and quarantine facilities offer a single room per person, as well as access to a bathroom with regular meals provided and a laundry service. The Red Dot Taxi service is used to transport anyone safely to and from facilities. If you are not able to isolate yourself, call the provincial hotline on 021 928 4102.\n\n[email protected]"}}
