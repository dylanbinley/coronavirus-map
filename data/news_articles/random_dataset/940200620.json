But it noted that her lawyers gave the commission medical records in February showing that she was suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s at \u201can advanced level uncommon to a person of her age.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe commission sought to balance its responsibility to ensure public confidence in a capable judiciary with compassion for Judge Simpson and her family over her heartbreaking Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis,\u201d Mr. Tembeckjian said in his statement.\n\nJudge Simpson\u2019s family declined to comment on the details of her illness. In a separate statement released on Monday, her husband, Jacob Walthour Jr., a hedge fund executive and the chairman of the board of Ebony magazine, said the \u201cearly, sudden and hollowing effects\u201d of Judge Simpson\u2019s ailment \u201cserve as a reminder to us all to live life passionately and with purpose every day.\u201d\n\nSome lawyers who appeared in front of Judge Simpson in the weeks and months before she took her leave raised questions about whether her condition might have affected her decisions from the bench.\n\nLast August, the same month she stepped down, the judge was considering the case of Nelson Cruz, a man who was requesting a new trial after spending more than 20 years in prison for a murder that he said he did not commit. Detective Scarcella had handled part of the investigation.\n\nWhen Judge Simpson ran through the list of reasons for why she was denying the request, Mr. Cruz\u2019s lawyer, Justin Bonus, was visibly upset, according to a video of the hearing.\n\nMr. Bonus informed Judge Simpson that she seemed to have misunderstood the evidence in the case \u2014 among other things, mistakenly suggesting that a prosecution witness who testified at the hearing had testified at trial. \u201cThis is wrong,\u201d Mr. Bonus told the court."}}
