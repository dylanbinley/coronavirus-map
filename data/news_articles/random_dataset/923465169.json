He noted that with so many \u201cborders and quotas\u201d, marriage was often the easiest way to move to a Western country.\n\nNielsen went on to say that given the challenges involved, a \u201csurprising\u201d number of couples managed to stay together. He described \u201cpatience and tolerance\u201d on both parties\u2019 behalf as being a major factor behind this, pointing out that these marriages were generally not simply a business but actually long-term love.\n\nThe figures showed that German women (118) made the third-most popular wives, followed by Poland (104). However, the figures should not be considered worrisome for Danish women given that 20,331 Danish men married Danish women last year."}}
