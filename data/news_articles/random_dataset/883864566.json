He intimated that he also wanted to build two roads to the Interior from Hope, one north up the Fraser Canyon, the other east to the Similkameen Valley.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.

But this didn\u2019t please Hope political leader Donald Chisholm.\n\n\u201c(Chisholm) replied to the Governor\u2019s remarks in a most injudicious and impolitic way,\u201d wrote R.E. Gosnell in the Aug. 22, 1908, Daily Province. \u201cThey wanted, he said, the privileges of a free country in every manner, shape and form, a free people, free roads and freedom from taxation.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives from Yale told Douglas they had no problem collecting a toll. So Yale was named the head of navigation, and got the road. And the southern road to the Similkameen fell by the wayside."}}
