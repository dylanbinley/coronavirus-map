But at the start of the council meeting Wednesday night, July 8, City Attorney Dick Jones recommended putting on the brakes.\n\nLocal activists had been contacting City Hall with concerns about red flags they saw in Thai\u2019s employment history. Noting \u201ccontroversy that\u2019s arisen,\u201d Jones said, \u201cwe have determined that the background check for the city manager position has not been completed.\u201d\n\nThai seemed in line to replace former City Manager Eddie Manfro, who resigned in February.\n\nIn 2017, the city of Monterey Park fired Thai from his position as director of management services, alleging credit card abuse and other problems. Thai filed a still-active lawsuit against the city claiming retaliation and defamation.\n\nIn an interview earlier this week, Thai denied any wrongdoing, calling the city\u2019s accusations against him \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at all the projects and good I\u2019ve done in cities throughout Southern California, you can see that not only am I qualified to be city manager,\u201d he said. \u201cI am going to do a fantastic job for the community of Westminster.\u201d\n\nAfter majoring in urban planning at Cal Poly Pomona, Thai worked for cities including Claremont, La Mirada, Tustin, South Pasadena and Beverly Hills. He now works at a private consulting firm in Fullerton.\n\nThai came to the United States from Vietnam as a child. The Sana Ana resident said he is drawn to Westminster\u2019s vibrant Vietnamese community. But while Little Saigon is a \u201cmecca for Vietnamese people,\u201d he said he hoped to explore ways to attract \u201cmainstream businesses and tourism\u201d as city manager.\n\nUnder the proposed contract, Westminster would have paid Thai $213,000 annually, plus a $250 monthly car allowance.\n\nOn Wednesday, prior to the council meeting, Mayor Tri Ta said in an email that the city conducted a thorough search for a new city manager in \u201ca fair, impartial and highly professional process.\u201d Council members interviewed six candidates before narrowing the field to Thai, he said.\n\nTa did not respond Thursday to requests for a comment regarding the postponement of a contract offer.\n\nAlthough Thai\u2019s potential appointment was put on hold Wednesday, more than a dozen residents still took the opportunity to express concerns in telephone calls and emails. Due to coronavirus restrictions, Westminster holds meetings remotely on Zoom.\n\n\u201cFor starters, he is not qualified,\u201d said one speaker, pointing out Thai \u2018s resume lacks the title of city manager. \u201cWe cannot afford to have someone who is learning on the job.\u201d\n\nTerry Rains, a regular critic of the council, said she and other residents \u201cprovided voluminous and compelling evidence as to why Mr. Thai should not be hired, all obtained via public records.\u201d\n\nBut one resident supported Thai, saying Westminster\u2019s first Vietnamese city manager would be \u201chistory in the making.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be intimidated by a few loudmouths,\u201d he said.\n\nWestminster paid Huntington Beach-based firm Bob Hall and Associates $19,500 to locate candidates. Some residents complained the recruiter should have better vetted applicants.\n\nHall, a former Fountain Valley city manager, said in an email that he gave the city \u201cseveral strong candidates among the 41 formal applicants for the position.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe responsibility of picking one individual from a pool of candidates submitted for consideration falls to the City Council,\u201d Hall said. \u201cI do not recommend a single candidate.\u201d\n\nIn an email Thursday, Thai declined to speculate on his chances of winning the job given the latest turn of events.\n\n\u201cI praise the Westminster mayor and City Council for fully vetting out their top management position,\u201d he said. \u201cThe time invested beforehand allows the council to know if the candidate is someone they can work with and is a good fit for the community.\u201d\n\n___\n\n(c)2020 The Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.)\n\nVisit The Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.) at www.ocregister.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."}}
