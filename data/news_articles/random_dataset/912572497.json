J.B. Pritzker announced Sunday that all bars and restaurants in Illinois will be closed to dine-in customers beginning at the close of business Monday.\n\nRestaurants will still be able to offer drive-thru and curbside pickup meals, the governor said. The closure dates are Monday, March 16, through March 30.\n\n\u201cWe are working with restaurant owners and food delivery services across the state to see if restaurants can safely keep their kitchens open so the restaurants can continue food delivery to people at their homes,\u201d Pritzker said.\n\nEdwardsville Mayor Hal Patton said he \u201ccompletely concurs\u201d with Pritzker\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWe will ask owners of these local establishments to reach out to our economic development director, Walt Williams, or Desiree Bennyhoff [president and CEO of the Edwardsville/Glen Carbon Chamber of Commerce] and we will get information on what establishments are doing pickups or deliveries on our website,\u201d Patton said.\n\nThe contact information can be found at the city of Edwardsville\u2019s website and the chamber\u2019s website, respectively.\n\nThe chamber is also working on a survey to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on business operations. The electronic survey is expected to be delivered Monday, March 16, according to the chamber\u2019s website.\n\nPatton added that he is advising community members to put the money they would normally spend at theses establishments aside so that when the ban is lifted, they can fully support local businesses.\n\nHe also advises the purchase of gift cards to these local businesses, as possible, so they can continue to pay bills and workers.\n\nMore Information Coronavirus \u2014 Who to contact The Illinois Department of Public Health has a statewide COVID-19 hotline and website to answer any questions from the public or to report a suspected case: call 1-800-889-3931 or visit www.idph.illinois.gov.\n\nOwner of Edison\u2019s Entertainment Complex, Matt McSparin said he appreciates the \u201cencouraging support in our community.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would simply add to keep the small, family-owned, locally owned businesses at the top of your list,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, some local business owners are slightly skeptical of the state\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cAlthough we all are sensitive to the nature of this health threat, I don\u2019t believe there was enough careful consideration of the far-reaching negative impact to the small business community with this order,\u201d McSparin said. \u201cThe corporate chains will continue to be less harmed with already established drive-through, delivery and curbside programs but many small businesses will not be able to sustain under a prolonged ban.\n\nThere have been no specifics from the government on how they may assist these folks that will suffer from loss of income and in turn, impact our entire economy not to mention the lost sales tax that the state sorely needs.\u201d\n\nIn regards to the 2020 primary election, Pritzker added that \u201cdemocracy must continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must elect leaders, even in less than ideal circumstances,\u201d he added. \u201cNone of these decisions I come to lightly and I work hard to consider all the benefits and consequences of every decision.\u201d\n\nAlso Sunday, officials said the number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the state have increased to 93.\n\nFive additional counties are now reporting cases \u2014 Champaign, Clinton, Sangamon, Whiteside, and Winnebago counties. Other locations with cases include Chicago and Cook, Cumberland, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, St. Clair and Woodford counties.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing the number of COVID-19 cases increase exponentially and in more locations across Illinois,\u201d Illinois Department of Public Health Director Ngozi Ezike said. \u201cAt this point, it is best to assume that the coronavirus is circulating in your community and you should take the same precautions when interacting with other people that you would when interacting with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. This may seem like an extreme step, but this is how we reduce the number of new cases and prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed.\u201d"}}
