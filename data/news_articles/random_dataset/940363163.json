This exercise was still in motion when the Pakistan government, in February, announced the scheme to extend generous scholarships for 1,600 Kashmiri students.\n\nSecurity agencies red-flagged the Imran Khan government\u2019s outreach to Kashmiri students soon after. Pakistan had been offering cheaper education options to Kashmiri students for years, mostly on the recommendation of Kashmiri separatist leaders. There had been several instances where Kashmiris had gone to Pakistan and its occupied territories through legal channels to study but returned via the Line of Control after being trained at terror camps.\n\nThose who did stick to studies returned more radicalised than they were when they left, said a counter-terror operative.\n\nMonday\u2019s MCI order deals with one part of what security agencies described as a big challenge.\n\n\u201cThis is to inform all concerned that entire territories of UT of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh are an integral part of India. Pakistan is in illegal and forcible occupation of a part of the territory. Accordingly, any medical institution in Pakistan occupied Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh (POJKL) requires permission/recognition under the Indian Medical Council Act 1956. Such permission has not been granted to any medical college in PoJKL. Therefore, any qualification obtained from medical colleges within these illegally occupied areas of India shall not entitle a person for grant of registration under Indian Medical Council Act 1956 to practice modern medicine in India,\u201d the MCI said.\n\nThis implied that students who pass out from professional colleges in PoK cannot sit for the exam meant for foreigners because the occupied territories are an integral part of India.\n\nSecurity officials told Hindustan Times that the MCI order only deals with one part of the challenge. It does not deal with students who receive their degrees from universities in Pakistan. \u201cUnless this is stopped, it would remain a key area of concern,\u201d one of them said.\n\nBut there has been no consensus at the meetings that have been held to discuss the security concerns from PM Khan\u2019s scholarship offer. An official said there were questions around the powers of the government to bar citizens from studying in certain institutions in the absence of enabling legal provisions.\n\n\u201cThis is still work in progress,\u201d he said, adding that security agencies were working out a plan that would withstand legal scrutiny."}}
