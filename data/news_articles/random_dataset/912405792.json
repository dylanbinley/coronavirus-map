The district is limited to the borders of Cook County, so only Cook County voters will be allowed to vote in the race.\n\n\n\nIllinois First District Appellate Court Sheldon A. \"Shelly\" Harris | harrisforjustice.com\n\nOther candidates seeking the seat include:\n\nP. Scott Neville, a former appellate court justice who has served on the state Supreme Court since 2018, when he was appointed to serve out the remainder of the term of retired Supreme Court Justice Charles E. Freeman, the state\u2019s first African American Supreme Court justice;\n\nAppellate Justice Cynthia Y. Cobbs;\n\nAppellate Justice Jesse G. Reyes, who, if elected would become the state\u2019s first Hispanic Supreme Court justice;\n\nAppellate Justice Margaret Stanton McBride;\n\nAppellate Justice Nathaniel R. Howse.\n\nNeville, Cobbs and Howse are all African American.\n\nThis election cycle, a number of legal associations again evaluated and rated the candidates, ostensibly as a way to help voters decide who to support in the election.\n\nThe Chicago Bar Association, for instance, rated Neville, Reyes and McBride as \u201chighly qualified.\u201d\n\nHarris, Cobbs and Howse were each rated \u201cqualified.\u201d\n\nEpstein was rated \u201cNot Recommended.\u201d\n\nWeekly Newsletter Sign-up and get latest news about the courts, judges and latest complaints - right to your inbox.

He noted the bar associations all operate under a \u201cbright line rule,\u201d established by the Alliance of Bar Associations for Judicial Screening.\n\nAny judicial candidates with less than 10 years of legal experience are automatically rated \u201cNot Recommended\u201d for the bench, Epstein said.\n\n\u201cThis is a reflection solely of that inflexible rule,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t reflect on my candidacy.\u201d\n\nEpstein has made his name in legal circles for his work, primarily through the firm of Jenner & Block, representing \u201cpeople who have been wronged,\u201d pro bono. At times, that work has taken him through to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nHis current campaign is based around fixing what he sees as \u201csystemic problems\u201d in Illinois\u2019 legal system.\n\nAmong other issues, he is seeking to allow independent parties to decide if judges have conflicts of interest in hearing certain cases; to deploy sentencing guidelines to \u201cfight bias in sentencing; to end cash bail for those charged with crimes; and to change the standard of evidence in Illinois courts, to the so-called Daubert standard, which he said would stop the courts from treating \u201cpseudoscientists\u201d as experts.\n\nEpstein noted his relative lack of experience has not stopped him from receiving endorsements, including, among others, from labor unions, including Teamsters Local 777; progressive political organizations, like Planned Parenthood, Chicago NOW PAC and Our Revolution; civil rights lawyers, including Jon Loevy and Alexander Polikoff; law professors, including Illinois political corruption expert Dick Simpson; and the former general counsel for the Illinois State Bar Association, Tom Murphy.\n\n\u201cI believe we have done an excellent job of changing the terms of the debate in this race and in this state,\u201d said Epstein.\n\nISBA also rated Neville, Reyes, McBride and Howse as \u201chighly qualified.\u201d It rated Cobbs as \u201cqualified.\u201d\n\nHarris, however, was rated \u201cnot qualified,\u201d noting concerns about his \u201cdemeanor\u201d as a judge and on the bench.\n\nHarris did not reply to questions submitted by the Cook County Record.\n\nAccording to a report from Injustice Watch, Harris has spent more than $1.3 million on the race. He has put $1.95 million of his own money into the campaign, and has not indicated where that money came from.\n\nNeville has received the endorsement of the Democratic Party in the contest."}}
