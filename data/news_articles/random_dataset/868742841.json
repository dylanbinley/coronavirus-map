From ballet to anything one wants to explore in life, I say GO FOR IT. I fully believe we should all be free to pursue our passions. Go climb your mountain-and love every minute of it.\"\n\nThe school writes on its official website: \"The aim of teaching Ballet at Thomas's is to inspire and nurture in our pupils a love of classical ballet and dance, its history and traditions and associated arts.\"\n\nAnd it seems George is following in his late grandmother's footsteps.\n\nPrincess Diana was a keen ballet dancer, learning it as a young girl through to her adulthood.\n\nShe was also a supporter of the English National Ballet and once put together a secret performance for Prince Charles.\n\nPrincess Charlotte will also be joining Prince George, starting school at Thomas's Battersea for the first time this year."}}
