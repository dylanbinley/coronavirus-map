But keeping, real strict vigilance on your neighborhood and who's coming in and out of it is the best way to deter crime, and that's what I want to stress. And hopefully we won't have any more of this,\" said CCPD Captain William Broyles.\n\nAt this point, it is not clear what charges, if any, the homeowner may be facing.\n\nNo one in the home was injured during the incident."}}
