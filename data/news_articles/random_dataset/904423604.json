Breeze Airways will be the name of the new company, which up until now was provisionally called \u201cMoxy.\u201d\n\nThe new airline, which labels itself as the \u201cworld\u2019s nicest airline,\u201d is still applying to its operating certificate with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration along with the U.S. Department of Transportation, and expects to start operations by the end of this year.\n\nThis will be Neeleman\u2019s fifth airline start-up, following the creation of Morris Air, WestJet, JetBlue and Azul. These four disrupted the markets they were founded in, and Breeze\u2019s plan is to disrupt the aviation market in the United States once again.\n\nWhile Morris Air brought the e-ticket to light, JetBlue was the first to count with Live TV onboard and Azul broke a long-lived duopoly in Brazil, the new airline plans to break the high concentration of traffic of the U.S. in fortress hubs.\n\nA media release by the entrant claims this results \u201cin diminished air travel options for entire segments of the country, with many routes now only served by connecting flights.\u201d Trying to benefit from this gap, Breeze wants to initially connect \u201cabandoned\u201d secondary cities in the United States with nonstop flights and low fares, while competing with new technologies to simplify the travel experience.\n\nThis ambition of dodging from routes already served by other airlines was already foreseen in 2018, when the first drafts of the then-called Moxy came to the media. In an interview for Skift, Neeleman then said that \u201cI doubt we\u2019ll have a single route that has any competition.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, this Friday the airline mogul, now CEO and President of the start-up stated in the press release that \u201cBreeze will fly non-stop service between places currently without meaningful or affordable service\u201d. He added that \u201c20 years ago, we brought humanity back to the airline industry with JetBlue. Today, we\u2019re excited to introduce plans for \u2018the World\u2019s Nicest Airline\u2019.\u201d\n\nBreeze\u2019s fleet plan is already outlined, with smaller jets to fulfill the airline capacity. Thirty Embraer E195s of the first generation are expected to come from Azul starting in May, while sixty Airbus A220-300 will be delivered, starting in April 2021.\n\nWhile the Embraer 195 is planned to operate in smaller cities and shorter routes with its lower capacity and cost-effectiveness, the larger A220-300 will come to serve longer routes and \u201cmid-sized\u201d markets, says Breeze.\n\nThe Breeze Airways logo (Photo: Breeze Aviation)\n\nAlong with the official name of the airline, Breeze Airways\u2019 logo and livery was also announced, sporting diverse tones of blue. The colors were created by Brazilian marketing specialist and aviation fanatic Gianfranco \u201cPanda\u201d Beting, which has already worked with Neeleman upon the creation of Azul\u2019s branding and marketing strategy in Brazil."}}
