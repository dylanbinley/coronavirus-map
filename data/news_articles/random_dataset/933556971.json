Unless you are vaccinated, in other words, then no more participation in society.\n\n\u201cThis pandemic feels like we\u2019re in the middle of a real-life Hollywood blockbuster,\u201d he wrote for The Age, eerily alluding to what many already believe about this fake \u201cplandemic\u201d production. \u201cLike all good movies, this one will leave us fundamentally changed well after it\u2019s ended.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur world will look and feel very different once the show is over,\u201d he added, using the same verbiage to suggest that the whole thing is one big Hollywood production. \u201cBut not for the better,\u201d he went on to write.\n\nIn Ciccone\u2019s view, all it will take for society to get back to \u201cnormal\u201d is for people to get vaccinated once a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine becomes available. But as is always the case, a contingent of people \u2013 and a growing one, we might add \u2013 will refuse the vaccine, which Ciccone believes can be dealt with by depriving such folks of their lives and livelihoods.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford, morally or economically, to give any ground to those who choose not to be vaccinated against COVID-19,\u201d he declared in an opinion piece. \u201cLet me be clear. I\u2019m not advocating that we vaccinate people against their will. That would be wrong.\u201d\n\nSo, what is Ciccone advocating? Simply put, those who refuse vaccination for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) are to be deprived of \u201cparticipation in everyday life,\u201d including no more entry into buildings, even for work purposes, and no more family tax benefits.\n\n\u201cRestaurants could be allowed the right to refuse entry to those who are not vaccinated against COVID-19,\u201d he adds. \u201cBusinesses, especially those involved in the care or service of vulnerable communities, might be allowed the right to refuse employment to those without a COVID-19 vaccination. Organisers of mass gatherings could deny the sale of tickets on this basis.\u201d\n\nHere in the United States, many resisters of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination are almost certain to activate their Second Amendment rights. Listen below to The Health Ranger Report with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, to learn more:\n\nIs this why Trump said that coronavirus vaccines will not be mandatory \u2013 because refusing them will result in social ostracization?\n\nAs many of our readers may recall, President Donald Trump recently announced that Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines will not be mandatory at the federal level, which made many of us lower our guard. But is a similar plan to Ciccone\u2019s currently in the works here in America that will make vaccination \u201coptional\u201d with the caveat that not getting jabbed ultimately restricts one\u2019s access to society?\n\nWe are already seeing this with the face mask ordeal as some of the more aggressive mask-loving militants are already telling the public, \u201cno masks, no entry.\u201d Does this imply that face masks are a type of precursor to vaccination, where one day in the very near future it will suddenly become \u201cno jab, no entry\u201d instead?\n\nMore related news about proposed government tyranny in response to Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine resistance is available at Tyranny.news.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nTheAge.com.au\n\nNaturalNews.com"}}
