It is likening someone to a member of the German political party led by Adolf Hitler which committed great atrocities. It is not a catch-all to criticise opposing, even extremist, political views. It is unacceptable and disrespectful for a councillor to use it towards a member of the public in a meeting.\"\n\nPendle Council\u2019s Standards Hearings Panel will consider the report and whether to impose a penalty early next year.\n\nLord Greaves said: \u201cThere has not been a full investigation. Philip Mousdale has conducted a few interviews that is all. I did not make an accusation. I made a comment about someone who was wearing a Tommy Robinson T-shirt.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned Tommy Robinson is a neo-Nazi and anyone who wears a Tommy Robinson T-shirt is a neo-Nazi supporter.\u201d\n\nMr McBeth said: \u201cI am very pleased that Pendle Council has found Lord Greaves guilty of breaking the Code of Conduct. His attitude towards people of a different view is atrocious and I hope now this sends out a very strong message to other councillors that they are being watched and that their behaviour and language must improve or else they will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nMr Mousdale said: \u201cAs this case will be considered by the Standards Hearings Panel in the New Year it\u2019s inappropriate for Pendle Council to comment at this stage.\u201d"}}
