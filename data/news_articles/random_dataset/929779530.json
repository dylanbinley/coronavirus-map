Justice Senchi of FCT High Court 13, Jabi, was withdrawn by the commission to forestall its being struck out by the court suo moto.\n\n\u201cFollowing the notice of seizure, the commission will apply to the court for an order of forfeiture under Section 48 of the ICPC Act.\n\n\u201cThis is in line with the federal government Policy focusing on recovery of proceeds of crime, pending when the tenure of the governor expires.\u2019\u2019\n\n(NAN)"}}
