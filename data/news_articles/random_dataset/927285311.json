Travel website Orbitz says flight and hotel searches for Las Vegas increased for the week of June 4-11 over searches the previous week. An Orbitz spokesperson said hotel searches increased more than flight searches, but both were up.\n\n\u201cThe most popular booking window for Vegas, i.e. the most popular month(s) to book travel to Vegas on Orbitz right now, is currently June, followed closely by July,\u201d Orbitz spokesman Mel Dohmen said. \u201cThat tells us Vegas is a top destination travelers are considering as travel starts to open back up this summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the news indicates more rooms may be booked than originally thought,\u201d Nevada Resorts Association President Virginia Valentine said. \u201cIt is looking like we\u2019ll have a very positive response to the reopening. Obviously, we want people to be safe when they come back, and we\u2019ve been making preparations now for months to bring them back to a safe and exciting environment.\u201d\n\nWhile the majority of the travel interest is coming from people who can drive to Las Vegas, Southwest Airlines says it\u2019s seen an increase in reservations for flights to Las Vegas since the casinos were given the green light to reopen."}}
