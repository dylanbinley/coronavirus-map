They produce 1,860 megawatts, or about 4 percent of the country's total energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, 90 percent of the country's electricity is generated from coal-fired stations. But its plants are ageing and poorly maintained, causing repeated power outages that have severely handicapped the country's economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government last year dropped controversial plans to build eight nuclear power stations, deals that had been initiated by former president Jacob Zuma.\n\n\n\n\n\nALSO READ:"}}
