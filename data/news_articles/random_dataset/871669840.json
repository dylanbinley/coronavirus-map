It doesn't have the same weight in a trial as testimony under oath, but Fernandez addressed the court and refuted many of the details that the prosecution's witnesses gave in the trial.\n\nHe told the court that on the night that Pastor Lucas' head was discovered in the pan Mason's pickup truck, he went to Sanchos Bar with his co-workers, who are his co-accused because they were there to socialize on a payday Friday.\n\nIn the most significant parts of his dock statement, Fernandez said, quote, \"At no time on the 15th of July, did I murder Mr. Lewellyn Lucas, nor did I see anyone murder him\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00a6 When the F150 arrived, I did not place anything inside the truck, nor did I see anyone place anything inside the truck. When I arrive at Sanchos Bar, I had no idea that a murder took place or a human head was inside the truck. At no time when being detained did anyone inform me of a head being found in the truck, nor did anyone search the F-150 in my presence\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00a6 I haven't seen that decapitated head, except for pictures shown in the disclosure in this matter\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00a6I, at no time, kidnapped anyone, place anyone inside a black F150 at the Intelco hill. At no time did I murder anyone, or have knowledge of a murder\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00a6 On the 15th of July, I presented myself for work. I am a hard-working person and very supportive father of four young kids, and this is not something I would ever do.\" End quote.\n\nSo, that's his defense, and at the end of the hearing today, we got a chance to briefly speak with his attorney about it:\n\nBryan Neal, Attorney\n\n\"Well I have closed my case, my client Keron Fernandez gave a dock statement in which he made it clear that he had nothing to do with this matter. So now it is for us to give closing arguments. But before that, Mr. Mason will be calling witnesses and he will decide which of his three rights, meaning will he remain silent, will he give a dock statement or will he take the stand? That will be determined on Wednesday.\"\n\nReporter\n\n\"Now, your clients was read his three rights and he chose to give an un-sworn statement. What's the significance of giving an un-sworn statement? I know it's his right but what's the significance of him doing that to him being accused in this murder?\"\n\nBryan Neal\n\n\"Well to my mind what that does is it gives the judge an opportunity to hear from the witness. We have heard from countless prosecution witnesses. This was the first opportunity that he had to give an account of himself and to let the judge see why he should not be convicted of this crime. So I hope that, we don't know what the judge will do, we are still at the closing stages of the case but we will see what weight the judge gives to his testimony and see if it can affect the outcome so that he is exonerated of this charge.\"\n\nReporter\n\n\"Your client chose to remain silent. I don't want you to get into too much details, but what led to him choosing what type of counsel was offered to him?\"\n\nNorman Rodriguez, Attorney\n\n\"We had a discussion. We met at the prison and we had a discussion and, as you know, the attorneys act on instruction, the client has to decide. After we had that discussion he had certain questions for me then he asked me those questions and after advising him he said that he thinks it's best that he remains silent. And if an accused person decides that he or she wants to remain silent, it would mean that that person himself or herself can see that there may not be a case made out against them.\"\n\nThe case resumes on Wednesday when William Mason will decide what defense if any, he will make."}}
