But the Soleimani killing isn\u2019t changing Jewish security around the world.", "TEXT": "JERUSALEM (JTA) \u2014 On March 17, 1992, a suicide bomber drove a truck into the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 29 and injuries hundreds of others.\n\nTwo years later, in the same city, on July 18, 1994, another bomber drove a truck into the AMIA Jewish center, killing 85 and injuring hundreds. It remains Argentina\u2019s worst-ever domestic attack.\n\nAnalysts believe that Hezbollah, the Lebanese terrorist group that is funded by Iran, were behind the two attacks, and that the bombings were responses to Israeli acts \u2014 the 1992 murder of Abbas Moussawi, a Hezbollah co-founder, and the 1994 capture of Mustapha Dirani, a Hezbollah ally and Lebanese security official.\n\nThe Argentine bombings are just two examples of bloody retaliation by groups tied to the Iranian military, which has a reputation for responding violently \u2014 and sometimes years later \u2014 to attacks on themselves or their allies. Jewish and Israeli sites have often been the Iranians\u2019 targets.\n\nBut after the U.S. assassination of top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, which enraged Tehran and prompted Iran\u2019s president to promise revenge, Jewish communities around the world aren\u2019t likely to change their security plans much.\n\nAccording to conversations that the Jewish Telegraphic Agency has held with representatives of a number of Jewish organizations, many Jewish communities have already significantly increased their security in response to years of rising anti-Semitism.\n\n\u201cFor the moment, we don\u2019t think that Iran will, in the short term, take revenge like what they did in AMIA and the embassy,\u201d Ophir Revach, the CEO of the European Jewish Congress\u2019 Security and Crisis Center, told JTA. \u201cWe think it\u2019s more between Iran and America and less about the Jewish community in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway [security is already] very high because of all what we have been seeing around the world with anti-Semitic attacks, so you don\u2019t see any change in Jewish communities around the world,\u201d he continued.\n\nRabbi Avi Shafran, the spokesman for the ultra-Orthodox Agudath Israel movement in the United States, agreed.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard of any uptick in concern, beyond the already \u2018high alert\u2019 that Orthodox communities, whose members are most identifiable as Jews, are already on,\u201d he said, referring to the recent surge in attacks against Orthodox Jews in the New York area. \u201cThat isn\u2019t to say that any such concern would be unwarranted. Many are the threats to visibly Jewish Jews \u2013 from the far right, the far left, idiotic hoodlums and Islamist actors, both individuals and state sponsored.\u201d\n\nMichael Masters, who heads the Secure Community Network, a security organization affiliated with the Jewish Federations of North America and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, did not sound the alarm either. But he said that a main concern right now is cyber retaliation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that [Iran] is part of the [cyber] calculus,\u201d he said.\n\nA co-founder of the Community Security Service, which trains thousands of volunteers to protect Jewish institutions across the U.S., was more vague in describing his organization\u2019s response.\n\n\u201cProtecting the Jewish community from active shooter or knife attacks \u2014 such as what happened in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and recently in Monsey \u2014 are rightly top of mind for CSS and the community,\u201d said Adam Sager. \u201cHowever, the reality is that the American Jewish community has to respond to the entire threat spectrum that it faces, including the extremes of an AMIA style attack. Fortunately, our methodology, based on professional security best practices, is flexible and robust enough to cope with different contingencies.\u201d\n\nThe Orthodox Chabad Lubavitch movement, however, took a different tack, warning its emissaries around the world to be on \u201chigh alert\u201d in the wake of the assassination.\n\n\u201cSoleimani\u2019s death will likely mark a major escalation in a simmering conflict between the U.S. and Iran and there is a strong likelihood that Iran will retaliate whether directly or indirectly,\u201d the Chabad-Lubavitch Security Commission warned earlier this month. \u201cAlthough there is no information at this time to suggest a direct threat to Chabad centers as a result of this escalation, as in past conflicts, there exists a concern that the current situation and tensions could contribute to a heightened risk and threat environment for Jewish facilities and Chabad centers.\u201d\n\nIn South Africa, Jewish Board of Deputies national director Wendy Kahn indicated that while members of her community, like others around the world, \u201care concerned about Iran\u2019s threat of revenge attacks\u201d and recognize that Jewish institutions \u201care considered as targets,\u201d there was \u201cno specific information regarding this country being of particular concern.\u201d\n\nStating that the \u201cdespotic, anti-Semitic regime in Iran has always posed a threat to the Jewish world,\u201d Alex Ryvchin, a co-CEO of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, described the loss of Soleimani as a move that would \u201churt Iran in an operational sense and has levied a cost on their leadership for seeking to sow destruction and carnage throughout the region and beyond.\u201d\n\nSouth America has long been a key base for Iran and its military proxies, especially Hezbollah. But besides noting that \u201calert levels were raised\u201d and \u201csecurity procedures were strengthened in view of the recent events\u201d by the Argentine government, current AMIA President Ariel Eichbaum did not signal that his organization was significantly changing its security protocol.\n\n\u201cWe join the voices that hope the escalation of tension and violence will cease,\u201d he said, \u201cand that calm and prudence will return to the region, through a pacific solution achieved with a political and diplomatic negotiation.\u201d"}}
