We got a developer interested in it and got funding from the Scottish Government.\u201d\n\nAs well as the housing grant funding, they got additional funding because the government recognised that it was a key site in the city centre.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s about engaging with the Scottish Government as early as possible \u2013 that\u2019s why we meet them every week to see what projects we are looking at.\u201d\n\nThe project was developed by Ark Estates, it was designed by Trail Architects and it was built by William Gray Construction, with support from Highland Council, Scottish Government and Highland Housing Alliance.\n\nIt was built on a challenging and sloping city centre site.\n\nWilliam Gray, managing director of ARK Estates, said that, despite the challenges, everyone who had worked on the project had put their heart and soul into it.\n\nHe said: \u201cEverybody took pride in it and it was just an amazing site to be involved with. It\u2019s completely unique for Inverness.\u201d\n\nWhen it won the award the RIAS judges said: \u201cThis social housing development is an inspired but pragmatic and affordable resolution of a difficult, extremely steep and almost inaccessible site.\n\n\u201cIts implementation has transformed and revitalised what was an all but abandoned no-go area of the city. The pleasant and now frequently used external public stairway and pedestrian route gives access to a series of external landings serving the three tiers of housing which provide 16 much-needed flats.\u201d\n\nClick here for more news"}}
