Our crew dealt with the issue quickly before departure and the flight continued as normal.\u201d\n\nThe incident isn\u2019t the first time Cameron\u2019s team has misplaced something important. In 2012, Downing Street confirmed that the then-prime minister had accidentally left his 8-year-old daughter in a pub.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.
