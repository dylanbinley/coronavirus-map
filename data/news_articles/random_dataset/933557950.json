Government has heard that call and invested.\n\n\"There\u2019s much to find out about how the funds will be applied but this investment feels like a decisive vote of confidence by Rishi Sunak and Oliver Dowden in the enormous contribution that the arts and culture can make to our social, educational, creative and economic recovery from the Covid-19 disaster.\n\n(Image: Geraint Lewis)\n\n\"It can\u2019t save every organisation or support every artist, but we unreservedly welcome and applaud it.\n\n\"Like others across the sector, we look forward to working closely with ACE and DCMS to ensure that the funds can be released quickly enough to minimise the damage of cuts being made to many organisations, and be used speedily to employ the freelance artists who have been so badly hit by the pandemic.\n\n\"We need to make sure that money reaches freelance artists fast, not only through the hardship funds announced from Netflix and others, but through meaningful employment too.\n\n\"In Bristol, we fervently hope these funds will allow us renew our work with our communities in the immediate term, and to rebuild our programmes through experimental performances until we can play safely to full houses again.\n\n\"It is also hugely encouraging to see that some in Government are thinking ahead towards the next five years of cultural investment.\n\n\"The economic impact and global reputation of British creativity has been tested, proven and newly understood through the many debates in parliament and the media over the last few months.\n\n\"Today\u2019s announcement creates a brilliant platform for a cross-party conversation to ensure that we have the strongest possible cultural infrastructure to deliver the inclusive and equalising vision of the Arts Council\u2019s ten year strategy, Let\u2019s Create .\"\n\nExchange\n\n(Image: BristolLive)\n\nOld Market's Exchange is one of Bristol's best-loved independent music venues and for good reason.\n\nAs well as welcoming the best up-and-coming acts around it boasts an impressive sound system and a reasonably-priced bar, making it a cracking spot for intimate gigs.\n\nVenue owner Matt Otridge said: \"We are delighted with the announcement and will continue to support the Music Venue Trust as they work to ensure that all the money reaches all of our venues and freelancers within our amazing network.\n\n\"It was amazing to see big name artists, MPs and music fans working together to lobby the Government and making sure they understood the value of our sector - not just in terms of how much money we generate, but in terms of how we support our local communities.\n\n\"To see music venues feature so prominently in the Government's press release was especially satisfying and shows that our industry is finally getting the recognition it deserves in relation to our cultural output.\"\n\n(Image: Giulia Spadafora / Soul Media)\n\nSave Bristol Nightlife\n\nAs its name suggests, Save Bristol Nightlife is an organisation which exists to protect the city's embattled night-time economy by raising awareness and trying to protect under-threat venues.\n\n\"Save Bristol Nightlife welcomes the act of the Government throwing the arts a lifeline and let's hope there's some left for grassroots venues after the big boys in London have had their needs met,\" said Annie McGann, who heads it up.\n\n\"It's great for this sector to have some form of funding to tide them over and it's a sign that the government recognises the contribution made to the economy by the creative sector, how important it is to the tourism industry and how integral it is to British culture and the currency of soft power.\n\n\"I know a lot of people are hoping to get a look in when it comes to the distribution of this money and I wish them luck.\"\n\nWant Bristol news straight to your inbox?
