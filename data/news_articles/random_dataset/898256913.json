It is ongoing and I believe it will be completed soon.\u201d\n\nA top official of the state close to the Operation Amotekun said the state would inaugurate its own chapter of the outfit before the end of the month.\n\nHe said, \u201c Osun will use the Olajokun Park in Gbongan as their operational base. We are still perfecting the operational procedures and we should complete that next week.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do now is to have men on patrol to know the areas very well. The people we will recruit will gather intelligence and send it to the operational base in Gbogan.\n\n\u201cThey will not arrest anyone, they will only gather information. We will recruit about 10 people each through the local government areas and the local council development areas.\n\n\u201cThese people understand the terrain, they understand the culture, beliefs and other things that can make them function better. It will be successful.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Special Adviser on Security to Ekiti State Governor, Brig Gen Ebenezar Ogundana (retd), said on Friday that Operation Amotekun would fully take off as soon.\n\nOgundana said the states were awaiting the operational procedure which would define the mandate of the operators.\n\nThe security adviser said, \u201cIt will take off as soon as possible. The only thing we are waiting for is the standing operational procedure that is going to define our mandate so that we don\u2019t send people out and something happened that we will not be able to explain. When we get the document, we will read it to them and we begin operation.\u201d\n\nOgundana said they would not do any recruitment in Ekiti because \u201cwe have people we are going to use\u201d.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe are using members of the Vigilante Group of Nigeria, it is an institution that is already on the ground. The Oodua Peoples Congress is a regional organisation that is fully on the ground that is registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission. The hunters have a national association registered with the CAC too.\n\n\u201cThese are the people we will use and we have them in Ekiti, we have them in every local government. We have contacted the local government and they will forward their lists to us. The kabiyesis are the ones coordinating the hunters and the head of the vigilante group has the list. That is what we are compiling.\n\n\u201cIn Ekiti, we are looking at between 400 and 500 people for a start.\u201d\n\nOgundana said the vigilantes, hunters and OPC members to be recruited would be trained to enhance results for the outfit.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe roles they are going to play is in terms of gathering information which will be localised and they will be located in their own atreas.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Lagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, on Friday said the state had donated 20 vehicles and would recruit 120 people to support Operation Amotekun.\n\nOmotoso, who spoke with one of our correspondents, said although the state already had its local Neighbourhood Watch similar to Operation Amotekun, it would continue to support anything that would promote peace in the region.\n\nHe said, \u201cLagos has donated 20 vehicles and in terms of personnel, we are going to contribute no fewer than 120. We also have a template on the same security. We have been running Neighbourhood Watch and it is working for us. But it does not mean that if there is any regional idea we would not support.That is why we have contributed vehicles in terms of equipment and 120 personnel in addition to other things that we are doing.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari\u2019s daughter uses Presidential jet for personal engagement\n\nThe commissioner said Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu was not able to attend the inauguration of the outfit on Thursday because he already had a scheduled programme for that day.\n\nACF, PANDEF, Ohanaeze, Middle Belt, others back security outfit\n\nMeanwhile, the Arewa Consultative Forum, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Ijaw Youth Congress, Pan Nigeria Delta Forum, MASSOB and Middle Belt Forum, and the National Association of Nigerian Students on Friday said they were happy with the South-West security initiative.\n\nThe President, Ohanaeze, John Nwodo, who described it as laudable, said, \u201cNobody needs to tell any Nigerian today that your security is in your own hands.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cCan you run a federation where the federating units cannot control their domestic security?\u201d\n\nAlso, the Secretary General of the Arewa Consultative Forum, Mr Anthony Sani, said Operation Amotekun would help tackle the security challenges facing the region.\n\nThis was contrary to the assertion from some youths in the region that the formation of the security outfit was a \u201cmilitary wing\u201d of the Oodua Peoples Congress.\n\nThe ACF chief said there was nothing wrong with the South-West governors coming together to proffers solution to the security issues in their region.\n\nSani said, \u201cThere is no harm in coming together against collective challenges for common good.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, it is in the place of the Attorney General and Minister of Justice to guide and protect the observance of the constitution. If the South-West goes against the constitution there is a way to caution them.\u201d\n\nThe leader of the youth wing of the Pan Niger Delta Forum, Mr Famous Daunemigha, said, \u201cThere is nothing wrong with what the South-West has done if they did it within the confines of the law.\u201d\n\nMASSOB leader, Uchenna Madu, said, \u201cWe salute the courageous spirit of the Yoruba governors and their political, traditional, religious and opinion leaders in unity.\u201d\n\nIYC President, Mr Eric Omare, called on other regions like the South-East and South-South to emulate the South-West and establish their own security outfits to remain alive.\n\nThe MBF President, Dr Bitrus Pogu, said the only way to defend the country was for every community to set up their own security arrangements, noting that the security forces had failed to defend the people.\n\nAmotekun can use guns like hunters, says ex-police commissioner\n\nA former Lagos State Police Commissioner, Fatai Owoseni, said Operation Amotekun officials would be allowed to carry Dane guns just like the way hunters are allowed to do.\n\nOwoseni, who is the Special Adviser to the Oyo State Governor on Security, said this during an interview on Channels Television\u2019s Sunrise Daily on Friday.\n\nWhen asked if the Operation Amotekun men would be allowed to use Dane guns, he said, \u201c(Yes) if it is necessary for them to use in some instances, because hunters do carry their Dane guns and go with their dogs. These are their tools and it is not illegal.\u201d\n\nHe, however, explained that the outfit would not run a detention facility but would purely be an intelligence gathering group.\n\nWhen asked if they would be allowed to make arrests, the retired CP said, \u201cThe power they have to make arrest is the same power you have. Every citizen has the power of arrest. When you arrest, you take to the police station. That is the same power. They are not going to operate a detention facility. It is non-state actors participating in security.\u201d\n\nNorth will emulate South-West govs \u2013Lalong\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum, Mr Simon Lalong, has said the North will soon launch its own outfit to combat the \u201cpeculiar\u201d security challenges facing the region.\n\nLalong, who is the Governor of Plateau State, spoke in Abuja shortly after meeting with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the Presidential Villa. He, however, clarified that the outfit would complement the work of the police and other security agencies.\n\nHe visited Buhari to brief him on the renewed killings in Mangu Local Government Area of his state on Thursday, where at least 13 people were officially confirmed dead.\n\nThe governor was reacting to a question on the decision to launch Operation Amotekun to confront insecurity in the South-West.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Herdsmen won\u2019t accept injustice from Amotekun, Miyetti Allah warns\n\nSpeaking with State House Correspondents, Lalong said, \u201cI am the Chairman of Northern Governors\u2019 Forum. We took a decision sometime last year. The situation in the South may not be the same with the North, but in the North we are also looking at some ways that will also address these issues. So, we have gone ahead to set up committees, those committees have done their work and we are going to meet to address these issues once and for all.\n\n\u201cTwo, we have also agreed to key into the community policing idea and at the level of the committee we have already gone far. Each state is already neck-deep in community policing.\u201d\n\nOn the latest killings in Plateau, he said the problem was caused by cattle rustlers.\n\nHerdsmen won\u2019t accept injustice from Amotekun, Miyetti Allah warns\n\nHerdsmen under the umbrella of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore have expressed scepticism over the inauguration of Operation Amotekun.\n\nMiyetti Allah, however, warned that it would not condone acts of injustice meted out to any of its members by the officials of the outfit or any other vigilance group.\n\nThe National Secretary of the group, Alhassan Saleh, said this on Friday during an interview with Saturday PUNCH.\n\nSaleh said, \u201cWe have no problem with them as long as they will not target our herders. We have our own defence mechanisms. We fight injustice anywhere, not only in Nigeria. So, if they end up meting out injustice to us, we will fight back. That is the truth but we are law-abiding.\n\n\u201cAnd as herders, we must herd our cows until there is an alternative provided for us. If they give us alternative, we will go there and if they say they don\u2019t want us, those that want to leave, will leave but what we will not sanction is anybody taking the law into their own hands because we have a history of fighting injustice anywhere there is oppression.\u201d\n\nHe stated that Miyetti Allah was not in support of cows straying into people\u2019s farms but movement as guaranteed by the constitution must be respected.\n\nSaleh recalled that herdsmen suffered acts of injustice when the Benue State Government set up the livestock guard which ended up extorting money from innocent herders.\n\nThe secretary said Operation Amotekun could be used by politicians to perpetuate themselves in power by election rigging.\n\nSaleh argued that South-West governors should have remained true to their call for state police rather than opt for the Operation Amotekun option.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWhen you empower groups and give them arms, the possibility is that others will follow suit and the central government will begin losing its power. Definitely, our politicians will begin to abuse these outfits.\n\n\u201cWhen it is election time, sitting governors will use the outfits to their advantage. The first casualties of such malfeasance will be the people of that state, because when they want to impose themselves, they use these people because they are already trained and armed just like in Benue State.\n\n\u201cAt the end, the livestock guards ended up killing people. It is on record because people have been tried and jailed. So, it is not the way forward. If they cannot push the debate for state police, they should not do such half measures.\u201d\n\nPolice identify 52 blackspots\n\nAccording to police officials in Ekiti State, there are blackspots Operation \u2018Amotekun\u2019 need to cover in a bid to intensify security in Ekiti State.\n\nThese are: Iyemero Ekiti axis, area between Ayede Ekiti and Isan Ekiti, Ilejemeje council area, Iwaraja \u2013 Efon Alaaye, link road between Osun and Ekiti states, and Erio Ekiti \u2013 Efon Alaaye Road.\n\nIn Ondo State, police officials identified blackspots as Akunnu-Auga Road, Sobe along Benin-Owo Expressway, Oba Akoko along Owo-Ikare Road, Benin-Ore Expressway, Ore-Shagamu Expressway, Ipele-Ido Ani-Isua Road and Akure-Ado road.\n\nThe Public Relations Officer, Femi Joseph, said the command was ready to work as soon as the operation started.

We too are ready to work with it, we will focus more on the black spots and I believe it will be a successful exercise,\u201d Joseph declared.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi said blackspots had become notorious for various criminal activities such as kidnapping and robbery in the state.\n\nHe listed them as Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta Road, Fidiwo, Onigarri, Kara Long Bridge, Ogbere J4 ,Odogbolu Junction and Owode-Ilaro Road.\n\n\u201cWe have some places we marked as vulnerable points like the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway especially along Fidiwo, Onigari, then towards Lagos, he added.\n\nPolice officials in Oyo State said there were over 20 black spots in the state.
