Kate Middleton revealed that one of Prince Louis\u2019 first words was from Great British Bakeoff, and we\u2019re both shocked and not shocked.\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton teamed up with Mary Berry, a former Great British Bakeoff host, for a holiday special titled A Berry Royal Christmas. The one-hour special airs on BBC One on Dec. 16, and it will feature the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge cooking up \u201ca festive feast to thank those who are spending their Christmas helping others\u201d\u2014such as firemen, police, and hospital staff. They\u2019re feeding over 150 people! In the lead-up to the special, Middleton has revealed that she and her kids are big fans of GBBO, and of Mary Berry in particular. \u201cActually, one of the last things we cooked together was your pizza dough!\u201d Middleton tells Berry in an Instagram clip from the special.\n\nIn fact, Mary Berry is such a presence in the Cambridge household that \u201cMary\u201d was one of youngest son Prince Louis\u2019s very first words. \u201cOne of Louis\u2019 first words was \u2018Mary\u2019 because right at his height are all my cooking books in the kitchen bookshelf,\u201d Middleton said, per The Daily Mail. \u201cAnd children are really fascinated by faces, and your faces are all over your cooking books and he would say \u2018That\u2019s Mary Berry\u2019\u2026so he would definitely recognize you if he saw you today.\u201d\n\nWow, swooning that the toddler who\u2019s fifth in line to the British throne is JUST as obsessed with Mary Berry as the rest of us! Between this and Middleton doing her own makeup to sneak into a pub, maybe the royal family is a tad bit relatable after all."}}
