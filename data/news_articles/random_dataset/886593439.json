They were mainly loading items like tomatoes onto waiting trucks.\n\nHe adds that while working in the market, they were approached by some men whose identity he can\u2019t recall. The men suggested to them an exciting offer of a well-paying job in DRC.\n\n\u201cSix of my colleagues refused the job but I and another friend accepted to go,\u201d he said.\n\nThe suspect says on a day he can\u2019t recall, he and more than 25 people embarked on the journey from Kampala at 10:00am by bus to Kasese Town. They later crossed into DRC through Bwera Border post.\n\nThough they didn\u2019t possess any valid travel documents, they were able to go through the border post checks until their final journey to the jungle.\n\nHe later learnt that the camp belonged to ADF rebels.\n\nThe next day, they were handed guns without any basic training on weapon handling.\n\nThey were told to use the guns to topple Rwanda\u2019s President Paul Kagame.\n\nHe says their base was in a jungle in Kisangani Tshopo\u2019s Province and often they would be sent to neighbouring Rwanda to loot food and abduct new fighters.\n\nHe says he only participated in raids in Rwanda three times because he feared the heavy gunfire exchanges that usually left many of his colleagues dead.\n\n\u201cOur commanders always sent us to raid foodstuff in Rwanda. But the government troops are good shooters. One day 15 of my colleagues died in such raids. I avoided such raids, whenever I was sent and sneaked back to the base,\u201d he said.\n\nHe says their commanders avoided raids in Ugandan territory, saying Uganda People\u2019s Defence [UPDF] soldiers are brave fighters use gunship helicopters.\n\nAfter months of fighting, he was given a reward of $400 (Shs1,400,000) while his colleagues received between US$ 600 (Shs2.2 million) to $900 (Shs3.3 million), depending on the period they had spent in the rebel camps.\n\nHe, however, says that after realising that the job wasn\u2019t exciting as promised, he and a friend decided to escape in January but were intercepted by Congolese government troops who stole their money before handing them over to Ugandan authorities in Kasese District.\n\nHe says he was interrogated and tortured for two months (between January and March) by security personnel at the Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence and later detained at the Police Special Investigation Unit in Kireka. They were released this month.\n\nThey were given Shs40,000 for transport to Kitgum District, according to the suspect.\n\nBrig Richard Kareimere, the UPDF Spokesperson confirmed that the man was indeed interrogated and was released on police bond.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true he was released on Police Bond,\u201d Brig Kareimere said on Thursday.\n\nThe suspect however wonders why he was re-arrested by security officers in Kitgum District.\n\nMr Robert Ogen, the Officer in charge of Criminal Investigations at Kitgum Central Police station, says they are holding the suspect pending further investigation.\n\nHe says the suspect was arrested on the orders of Kitgum Resident District Commissioner, Mr William Komakech. Mr Komakech says the arrest is in connection with an earlier alleged rape case.\n\nIn April, eight children from Purongo Sub-county in Nwoya District were rescued by CMI operatives in Kasese District while being ferried to suspected ADF camps in DRC."}}
