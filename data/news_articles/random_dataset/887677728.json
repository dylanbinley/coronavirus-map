As a result, (conductors, trainpersons and yard workers) at CN will be on strike.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a brief statement issued Nov. 19, CN said it is \u201cdisappointed that the TCRC has initiated strike action.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will return to the negotiating table today, with the assistance of federal mediators,\u201d the company said.\n\n\u201cWe have no further comment at this point.\u201d\n\nThe strike is expected to affect all Canadian bulk freight traffic at CN, including movements of western Canadian grain.\n\nThe railway\u2019s operations in the United States will not be affected, said a Nov. 19 update from Reuters.\n\nThe strike at CN comes at a inopportune time for the Liberal government.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, federal Labour Minister Patty Hajdu and Transport Minister Marc Garneau said they were monitoring the CN strike situation closely.\n\nThe two ministers were to meet this week with representatives of CN and the TCRC in hopes of averting a strike.\n\nThe House of Commons is currently not sitting and MPs are not scheduled to return until Dec. 5.\n\nUnder Canadian parliamentary rules, any potential back-to-work legislation would only be considered after a new speaker is elected and the speech from the throne has been read.\n\nIt is also unclear whether a minority Liberal government would intervene, once Parliament returns. In order to pass back-to-work legislation, the Trudeau government would rely on the co-operation of other political parties.\n\nTCRC members at CN have been working without a contract since July.\n\nIn an earlier news release, the union said wages are not a sticking point in the negotiations.\n\nInstead, the union cited safety concerns, work hours and health benefits as key issues.\n\nCN and TCRC have been involved in negotiations for the past seven months.\n\nIn September, union members voted 99 percent in favour of strike action.\n\nThe union served the company with 72 hours strike notice late last week.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor Canadian grain farmers, the strike will have immediate implications.\n\n\u201cThis strike comes at a terrible time for agriculture,\u201d said Jeff Nielsen, chair of Grain Growers of Canada (GGC).\n\n\u201cGrain farmers from coast to coast are experiencing one of the most challenging harvests in recent memory and international trade disputes have closed some of our most reliable markets. \u201cAny delay in shipping will damage our access to hard-won markets.\u201d\n\nAdded Markus Haerle, GGC vice-chair: \u201cCanadian farmers are ready to ship grain but are once again at the mercy of the railways.\u201d\n\nIn Saskatchewan, the Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan (APAS) issued a similar statement, urging Ottawa to take immediate action.\n\n\u201cPrairie farmers do not get paid unless we can ship our products to port, \u201d said APAS president Todd Lewis.\n\n\u201cWe have experienced a tremendously difficult production season on top of falling commodity prices due to trade issues in our major markets. Any additional factor which threatens our cash flow presents a grave risk to our operations.\u201d\n\nLewis said rail delays would disrupt the remainder of the winter shipping season when grain shipments typically face delays due to weather.\n\n\u201cFarmers are innocent bystanders in this labour dispute. We have ships waiting at Canadian ports to load grain and we need our government to take all measures necessary to ensure that products can move.\u201d\n\n\u2013 With files from Reuters"}}
