The only questions were whether it would be held before Christmas or next spring, and before or after Brexit had happened.\n\nWith hindsight, these discussions are revealing. As the election campaign gets underway officially, Johnson\u2019s opening speech tonight will show he is fighting on a false premise. He will claim he doesn\u2019t want an election, but had \u201cno choice\u201d because of \u201cthis blockading parliament.\u201d\n\nYet parliament did not block his Brexit deal - he blockaded himself. He drew stumps on the bill, implementing it after MPs rightly rejected his attempt to ram it through the Commons in just three days. Johnson then calculated his best chance of winning a majority would be in a pre-Brexit election.\n\nDownload the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines\n\nThose ministers who would have preferred him to press on with the bill will now be worried: the early days of the election have not gone according to plan for the Tories. Johnson might want a \u201cBrexit election\u201d but campaigns usually take on a life of their own, with unpredictable twists - as the rows engulfing Jacob Rees-Mogg and Alun Cairns show.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

With Labour portraying the Tories as an out of touch, privileged elite, the Commons leader will not be allowed to forget his ill-judged words. Cairns, the Welsh secretary, is accused of not being honest about when he knew a former aide had been blamed for the collapse of a rape trial. The UK cabinet minister has now quit over the allegations.\n\nThese stories were a reminder that, no matter how much the Tories want the election to be about Brexit, other issues are bound to intrude \u2013 and rightly so, given we are choosing a government for the next five years. If Johnson had wanted a Final Say referendum on Brexit, he should have called one.\n\nThe media was never going to allow one issue to eclipse all others during a six-week campaign. It likes to set the agenda, not have it imposed by politicians.\n\nWorryingly for Johnson, this means the Tories will also have to fight on ground such as public services and equality that are much more favourable to Labour. After addressing Brexit yesterday before the Tories could accuse him of avoiding the issue, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech today moved quickly on to the \u201creal change\u201d he offers across the domestic agenda.\n\nIn any case, Brexit might not be the one-way street the Tories hope for, as Labour\u2019s attack on the threat to the NHS from a US trade deal proves. \u201cNot for sale\u201d, the cry of Labour activists, might yet compete with the Tories\u2019 powerful \u201cget Brexit done\u201d message.\n\nTeam Boris insists it has learned lessons from Theresa May\u2019s mistakes at the 2017 election. Those discussions about this election ensured the party was ready for one. Incredibly, Labour was better prepared than the Tories when May announced her snap election.\n\nThis time, there will be a single chain of command, rather than competing Tory campaigns; Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s influential Number 10 adviser, has allowed Conservative Campaign Headquarters to \u201ctake back control\u201d through Isaac Levido, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the Australian campaigner Sir Lynton Crosby.\n\nJohnson will be a much better campaigner than May. He could hardly be worse. Love him or hate him, he is a big figure who will dominate this campaign. He will look strong and some voters will like that, even if they are not natural Tories. The politician who as a child wanted to be \u201cworld king\u201d will be more than happy to be a presidential figure.\n\nRemarkably, May did not enjoy the limelight and yet her party\u2019s campaign was built around her. \u201cI\u2019m the leader of the Conservative Party not a presidential candidate \u2026 I don\u2019t want it to be about me,\u201d May complained, according to Anthony Seldon\u2019s revealing book \u201cMay at 10,\u201d published tomorrow.\n\nJohnson is re-running May\u2019s strategy of appealing to Leave voters in Labour\u2019s traditional strongholds in the North and Midlands. The election will hinge on whether he succeeds where she failed.\n\nTrue, \u201cget Brexit done\u201d is more cogent three and a half years after the 2016 referendum. True, Johnson has a much stronger domestic offer on the NHS, crime, schools and the cost of living than May did. But further outbreaks of \u201cfoot in mouth\u201d like Rees-Mogg on Grenfell will not help the Tories win people\u2019s trust on such issues.\n\nJohnson needs them to be eclipsed by Brexit, and yet there is no guarantee that will happen. After all, May also wanted a \u201cBrexit election\u201d but could not prevent the spotlight getting stuck on austerity and public services. If history repeats itself, Johnson will be in trouble."}}
