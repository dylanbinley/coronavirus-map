All of them have been released on bail, including another well-known pro-democracy activist, 23-year-old Agnes Chow, local media reported.\n\nMr. Lai\u2019s arrest was the most high-profile yet under a new national security law China imposed on Hong Kong. Scenes of police officers searching Apple Daily offices, which were streamed live by some of the newspaper\u2019s staff Monday, heightened fears about the future of a free press in Hong Kong.\n\nHis arrest galvanized support around the city. Scores of Hong Kongers lined up early Tuesday to purchase copies of the daily, which bore the front-page headline, \u201cApple Daily will fight on.\u201d"}}
