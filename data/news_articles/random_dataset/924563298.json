Credit: AAP\n\n\u201cIn the middle of the biggest ever demand on Centrelink, in an area with more public housing than almost anywhere in the country, the minister gives just over 24 hours\u2019 notice that people will be left without a local service.\n\n\u201cClosing a major Centrelink office with just over a day\u2019s notice while the country suffers Depression-era joblessness is utter incompetence and a savage attack on people in need of help.\u201d\n\nOnline push\n\nServices Australia general manager Hank Jongen promoted Centrelink\u2019s online services and the South Melbourne location as an alternative to Abbotsford.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to providing quality face-to-face assistance for people accessing our services,\u201d Jongen said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been making rapid improvements to support the many Australians who need our help and we know people are increasingly taking advantage of online options to manage their Centrelink and Medicare needs.\n\nMore on 7NEWS.com.au\n\n\u201cIn fact, all Medicare related claims, changes or inquiries can now be done online or over the phone.\u201d\n\nThe three nearest Centrelink offices - in South Melbourne, Prahran and Camberwell - are each at least 15 minutes away by car, 30 minutes by tram or 80 minutes on foot.\n\n\u201cThe minister\u2019s supposed solution for these thousands of people, to walk the 6km all the way over the Yarra to South Melbourne to the next closest option, would be laughable were it not unimaginably cruel,\u201d said Bandt, the area\u2019s federal member since 2010.\n\n\u2018Attacking the vulnerable\u2019\n\nBandt claimed the government\u2019s reasoning that it \u201ccouldn\u2019t negotiate a lease extension or find an alternative site is simply not credible\u201d in the wake of other Centrelink closures around the country this year.\n\nHe called on Stuart Robert, the Minister for Government Services, to open a temporary Centrelink office in Abbotsford.\n\n\u201cAny competent minister should be able to find an office property somewhere in Melbourne,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe government has snapped back to attacking the vulnerable.\n\n\u201cStuart Robert must provide a workable solution for the thousands of people who rely upon this service immediately, until such a time that a permanent option is set up.\u201d\n\nIn the video below: Victorian nursing homes in lockdown"}}
