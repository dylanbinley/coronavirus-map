That depends on who you ask.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry and its proponents tout fracking\u2019s economic benefits as this oil and gas extraction technique has led the march toward the nation\u2019s energy independence. But as our understanding of the technique grows, so too does our knowledge of its many drawbacks. Nowhere is this dynamic more apparent than in Ohio, at the vanguard of the nation\u2019s fracking boom thanks to the Utica and Marcellus shale reserves to the east of the state, which have sparked something of a fossil fuel industry feeding frenzy over the past decade.\n\nThe amount of natural gas Ohio produces annually ballooned from 78 billion cubic feet in 2010 to nearly 1.8 trillion cubic feet in 2017\u2014an increase of more than 2,200 percent\u2014according to federal figures. And what kind of impact has this had? Between 2007 and 2016, employment in Ohio\u2019s shale industries grew 62 percent. A new ethane cracker plant is reported to bring hundreds more full-time jobs to Ohio\u2019s Belmont County. When Vice President Mike Pence trumpeted to the assembled crowd at the Oil and Gas Association\u2019s annual meeting earlier this year in Columbus that the energy industry was \u201cstrengthening the foundation under families here in Ohio and all across this nation,\u201d he was met with warm applause.\n\nTen years on though, tough questions are being asked not just of the industry\u2019s economic impact in Ohio\u2019s poor Appalachian heartland, but also of the damage it\u2019s causing to the environment, the climate and human health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impacting people locally,\u201d Ned Ketyer, a medical adviser with the Pennsylvania-based nonprofit Environmental Health Project, told the Independent Media Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s impacting their health. It\u2019s impacting regional health. It\u2019s impacting local and regional economies in a negative way. And ultimately, it\u2019s affecting the climate system in a way that\u2019s completely contrary to any kind of urgent climate solutions that we need to embrace right now.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental Effects\n\nThe growing literature surrounding the environmental impacts from fracking is already pretty broad. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) own years-long study concluded that fracking operations have contaminated drinking water resources and have led to inadequately treated wastewater being dumped into surface water sources. Scientific and government research links fracking with an increased likelihood of earthquakes.\n\nThen there\u2019s the issue of the industry\u2019s climate footprint at a time when a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is needed to avoid some of the worst impacts from global warming. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration found last year that emissions from the oil and gas industry were a major contributor to growing atmospheric levels of methane, an especially potent greenhouse gas. A new study out of Cornell University came to the same conclusion, linking a global spike in methane emissions to the fracking of shale gas.\n\nIn Ohio, some of the localized environmental impacts make for stark reading. A recent article in StateImpact Pennsylvania (part of an excellent series looking at the industry\u2019s environmental footprint in Ohio and Pennsylvania) details complaints among residents living in close proximity to fracking infrastructure of things like gas leaks, drinking water contamination and discoloration, as well as fish kills.\n\nFish aren\u2019t the only kind of wildlife at risk. Cornell University found a possible link between exposure to gas drilling operations and cases of illness, death and reproductive issues in cows, horses, goats, llamas, chickens, dogs and cats in fracking states like Ohio.\n\n\u201cWe know the industry doesn\u2019t pay for its harm and the environmental damage that it causes,\u201d Amy Mall, a senior advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, told the Independent Media Institute. She added that federal regulatory \u201cloopholes\u201d are a large part of the problem.\n\nFor example, if oil and gas wastewater were subject to federal hazardous waste rules rather than generic standards that apply to all non-hazardous solid waste, \u201cit would be regulated very differently at the state level,\u201d Mall pointed out. This, at a time when nearby states transport huge quantities of wastewater to Ohio for disposal.\n\n\u201cBy not being held accountable for their pollution, the industry is shifting a lot of the economic responsibilities to general society,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018Ohio Wasn\u2019t as Well Researched\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s increasing awareness, too, surrounding the possible human health toll from living too close to fracking infrastructure\u2014issues like cancer, preterm births, low-birthweight babies and asthma. The Physicians for Social Responsibility\u2019s latest compendium on fracking\u2019s health impacts comprises more than 1,700 peer-reviewed studies.\n\nElise Elliott, a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, participated in a community-based study in Ohio looking at proximity to oil and gas wells and the impact that might have on human health and water contamination. The researchers found that the closer Ohioans live to these wells, the more likely they are to suffer general health problems like stress and fatigue. Likewise, proximity to wells was associated with higher concentrations of contaminants in the water.\n\nNevertheless, there\u2019s still a dearth of hard data, say experts, when it comes to understanding exactly how the fracking boom might be impacting the health of Ohioans. Agencies charged with overseeing the industry report how residents only rarely file official health complaints (though they have submitted thousands of much broader complaints). \u201cWe were noticing in the literature that Ohio wasn\u2019t as well researched as some other regions in the U.S.,\u201d said Elliott, explaining why that state was chosen for the community health study.\n\nIt also helps explain why Elliott urges caution when it comes to directly linking health issues with exposure to some of the contaminants\u2014air pollutants like benzene, hydrogen sulfide and formaldehyde\u2014typically found around fracking sites, at least right now. \u201cOur knowledge on this is definitely growing,\u201d she said, \u201c[but] we\u2019re not quite there yet to say definitively what it does.\u201d She urged continued research in the field, such as the potential link between fracking and childhood leukemia.\n\nEconomic Impact\n\nOn the flip side, proponents of the fracking boom argue that the economic benefit to Ohio outweighs any deleterious effects. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very sizeable industry,\u201d said Gilbert Michaud, an adjunct assistant professor of economics at Ohio University who has studied the impact the fossil fuel industry has had on the state\u2019s economy. According to his own calculations, the shale industry\u2019s direct and indirect impact on the state in 2015\u2014including that through employment, wages, and the multiplier effect\u2014amounted to more than $22 billion. But how widely felt is this impact?\n\nThe nonprofit Ohio Education Policy Institute finds how fracking-generated tax revenue has helped to bridge the wealth gap between school districts, particularly in eastern Ohio. But a deeper look reveals a more complex picture. For example, broad underfunding for elementary education means the statewide wealth disparity still exists between rich and poor school districts. And in his 2018 study, Michaud warned of the \u201cless-desirable vestiges\u201d of fracking in the poor rural areas of Appalachian Ohio. \u201cThe shale industry may be another case of resource extraction with a failure to capture and retain local value,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMichaud told the Independent Media Institute how the largest employing sector of Ohio\u2019s shale industry is pipeline construction, which typically offers a short window of employment. \u201cOnce the infrastructure is in place, then those occupations aren\u2019t really needed,\u201d he said, adding that these jobs typically go to out-of-state workers anyway.\n\nOn top of that, those sectors that provide more stable, long-term employment to Ohioans, like jobs at the well pad itself, generally pay the industry\u2019s smaller wages, said Michaud. \u201cThat\u2019s not really the secret sauce for future prosperity, right?\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the issue of too little of the fiscal windfall trickling down into poor rural communities that constitute the industry\u2019s heartland, he said. This leaves already underfunded local services stretched to breaking point as they grapple with fracking\u2019s residual environmental and health problems. \u201cA lot of these impacts aren\u2019t being retained in these communities that desperately need positive economic development and jobs,\u201d said Michaud. \u201cThis is your quintessential Appalachian curse\u2014your resource extraction boom and bust cycle.\u201d\n\n\u2018Petrochemical Cluster-Frack\u2019\n\nDescribing the shale industry in Ohio as a \u201cpetrochemical cluster-frack,\u201d Environmental Health Project\u2019s Ned Ketyer agrees with Michaud\u2019s assessment. \u201cAny job that directly threatens the health of me or my family or my patients\u2014I\u2019m a pediatrician\u2014or that threatens the health of every child, even children who haven\u2019t been born, by accelerating climate change, those jobs are not worth supporting,\u201d he said, adding that, \u201cessentially in the Ohio River Valley, we\u2019re fracking for plastic, which is one thing nature doesn\u2019t need any more of.\u201d\n\nThe pathway toward renewables is a complicated one in Ohio, however. In 2014, for example, the state imposed a two-year freeze on its renewable and energy-efficiency standards, and currently is in second-to-last place in the country in terms of total electricity production from renewable sources, just ahead of Delaware. According to Ketyer, other reasons for an expedited switch to renewables exist in plain sight.\n\n\u201cIt really is an eye-opening thing to take a drive through the Ohio River Valley. This is an area that should not have such high levels of air pollution\u2014some of the worst air pollution in the country. Shouldn\u2019t have such high levels of ozone,\u201d said Ketyer, describing scenes of rural poverty, dilapidated roads and crumbling buildings, interspersed with oil and gas industry infrastructure. \u201cWhen you go through the Ohio valley, you see an area that should be achingly beautiful.\u201d\n\nThis article was produced by Earth | Food | Life, a project of the Independent Media Institute.\n\nDaniel Ross is a journalist whose work has appeared in Truthout, the Guardian, FairWarning, Newsweek, YES!
