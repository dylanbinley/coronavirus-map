Fox News anchor Jeanine Pirro described Floyd\u2019s death in detail, saying that the police officer who kept him to the ground needs to face justice.\n\n\u201cGeorge Floyd was begging, saying he couldn\u2019t breathe, saying please, please. This man who put his knee on the neck of George Floyd does not deserve to be free in this country,\u201d Pirro said.\n\nRadio host Rush Limbaugh said that he respects people in law enforcement, but noted that the Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s actions cannot be justified.\n\n\u201cI cannot find a way to explain that. I can\u2019t find a way to justify it. I don\u2019t care what the guy did,\u201d he said.\n\nLimbaugh used the opportunity to attack the Democratic Party, arguing that Democratic mayor of Minneapolis Jacob Frey and other \u201cleftists\u201d in Minnesota have done nothing for the African American community.\n\nEven some Republican politicians described Floyd\u2019s death as a \u201cmurder.\u201d Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy used such terminology during a Friday interview with Fox News, but he also criticized the demonstrators, saying that \u201cthe people who are trying to burn down Minneapolis should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\u201d\n\nChair of the Republican Party of Kentucky J. McCauley Brown said that he \u201ccan understand totally why people are protesting,\u201d adding that it is \u201cunfortunate\u201d there has been violence at the demonstrations.\n\nFox News anchor Tucker Carlson\u2019s commentary was radically different. Carlson opened his Friday show with a chyron calling the demonstrators \u201cCriminal Mobs\u201d and suggested that Republicans push back against the protests. Carlson got into a heated exchange with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, asking Cruz why police brutality is to blame for Floyd\u2019s death.\n\nCarlson grilled Cruz, and asked why the officer who arrested Floyd is being charged with murder.\n\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t anybody stand up for the rest of us, for civilization?\u201d the anchor asked the senator.\n\nTrump has expressed sympathy over Floyd\u2019s death, but he has also strongly condemned the protesters. Trump\u2019s initial reaction to the protests was to tweet \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d The message was interpreted as a call for law enforcement to use violence against the demonstrators, but the president later made an effort to clarify his remarks.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump said that the federal government will step in and intervene in the protests unless Democratic mayors and governors take action. The commander-in-chief indicated that he would be willing to use military force."}}
