They continued talks on Tuesday in Montreal amid union concerns over fatigue, safety and ensuring that workers\u2019 breaks are not reduced.\n\nCanada, one of the world\u2019s biggest exporters of farm products, relies on CN and Canadian Pacific Railway to move canola, wheat and other commodities over vast distances from western farms to ports. Crude oil shippers and the mining industry also depend on the railways.\n\nThe strike comes at an awkward time for Trudeau\u2019s government, which relies on smaller parties to pass legislation and faces criticism from western provinces about its failures to get new oil pipelines built. Trudeau has said he is not reconvening Parliament until Dec. 5, and the government cannot start the process to force workers back on the job until then.\n\nAndrew Scheer, leader of the Conservatives, the second-largest party in Parliament, and Alberta Energy Minister Sonya Savage each separately urged Trudeau on Twitter to recall Parliament immediately.\n\nThe Canadian mining industry, which accounts for more than half of annual rail freight revenues, depends on CN to transport supplies to company sites and products from their operations.\n\n\u201cThis strike will result in a severe reduction or elimination of railway capacity and will trigger the closure of mines with concurrent layoffs of thousands of employees beginning in a matter of days,\u201d said Pierre Gratton, president and CEO of the Mining Association of Canada.\n\n\u201cSCREECHING HALT\u201d\n\nIndustry groups ranging from the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters to propane and fertilizer groups said Ottawa needed to step in to limit damage to the economy.\n\nThe BC Council of Forest Industries, which represents the sector in British Columbia, expressed concerns about the disruptions caused by the strike for rail transport.\n\n\u201cNinety percent of the forest products we produce are sent to export markets in North America and around the world,\u201d Susan Yurkovich, the body\u2019s president, said.\n\n\u201cA disruption of this critical transportation network will adversely impact BC forest companies at a time when we are already facing significant challenges and increasing competition from around the globe\u201d, Yurkovich added.\n\nCN and CP also collectively handle nearly all grain movement in Western Canada, the country\u2019s crop belt, split roughly evenly between the railways.\n\nThe stoppage \u201chas an impact before it even begins because companies pull back sales in anticipation of a strike,\u201d said Wade Sobkowich, executive director of the Western Grain Elevator Association, whose members include Cargill Ltd, Richardson International and Viterra Inc.\n\nCN\u2019s shipments of hazardous goods such as crude are likely to come to a \u201cscreeching halt\u201d even if the railroad\u2019s management steps in to limit freight volumes, said Kent McDougall, chief commercial officer at Torq Energy, which loads crude oil in Western Canada onto trains operated by both CN and CP.\n\nA strike may temporarily constrain CN\u2019s volumes, but will not likely have a meaningful long-term impact on the company\u2019s earnings, Credit Suisse analysts said in a research note on Monday, adding that Ottawa has historically been quick to intervene.\n\nShares of Montreal-based CN were down 1%, while the benchmark Canadian share index was up slightly.\n\nCanadian Labour Minister Patty Hajdu and Transport Minister Marc Garneau said they are monitoring the CN strike situation closely after meeting with the two sides on Monday.\n\nCN said in a statement that it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d at the strike action. CN\u2019s service in the United States will continue operating despite the strike.\n\nThe company said on Friday it would cut management and union jobs as it grapples with an economic slowdown.\n\nRail workers with the Teamsters held their last strike in 2009, when locomotive engineers walked off the job for five days, the union said.
