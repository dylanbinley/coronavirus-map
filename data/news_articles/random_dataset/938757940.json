I saw that situation in the spiritual realm and warned the Igbo personalities warming up for the 2023 presidential election to have a rethink and rather channel the energy and resources to Biafra actualization.\n\n\u201cIt is a sealed deal that an Igbo man will never be allowed to rule Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAccording to how it was revealed to me, an Igbo man, after much pressure to rule, may be allowed to become president but shortly after, insecurity, including Boko Haram insurgency and banditry, will be intensified to discredit such president.\u201d\n\nThis is coming at a time when a coalition of Igbo Groups had asked Gen. T.Y Danjuma (rtd) to rewrite history by supporting a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction in 2023.\n\nThe coalition demanded that Danjuma apologises to Igbo nation and advocate for 2023 Igbo presidency, noting that he (Danjuma) and others of 4th battalion in Mokola, Ibadan Oyo State, were involved in a counter-coup of 29th July 1966, which resulted in the killing of Aguiyi-Ironsi."}}
