Other shipments came from South Korea and the U.K.\n\n\u201cThese counterfeit driver\u2019s licenses can lead to disastrous consequences,\u201d CBP\u2019s Ralph Piccirilli said in a statement. \u201cCriminal organizations use these counterfeit IDs to avoid attracting attention to their illegal activities.\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nThe CBP official noted that most of the phony IDs were for college-age students, and that most had the same photos but came with different names. Alarmingly, CBP officials discovered that the barcodes on the fake Michigan licenses were functional.\n\n\u201cThese fraudulent identity documents can lead to identity theft, worksite enforcement, critical infrastructure protection, fraud linked to immigration-related crimes such as human smuggling and human trafficking,\u201d the CBP said in a news release.\n\nThe agency noted further that \u201cthese documents can be used by those individuals associated with terrorism to minimize scrutiny from travel screening measures.\u201d\n\nPiccirilli noted further that the licenses were \u201cvery realistic\u201d and he praised his officers for being able to identify them and single them out.\n\nBut it makes you wonder: How many more have gotten through?\n\nIn April, CBP said in a press release that the agency was witnessing an uptick in the smuggling of fake documents at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport:\n\nIn the last six months, CBP officers at DFW intercepted nearly 900 counterfeit driver\u2019s licenses that were delivered via international shipping services to the Dallas area. Approximately 2000 fake IDs have been seized over the last 18 months.\n\n\u201cWhat is most disconcerting about theses interceptions, besides the volume which we are experiencing, is the ease in which so many young people freely share their personal information with counterfeiters abroad,\u201d said CBP Port Director Timothy M. Lemaux, Area Port of Dallas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to collaborate with local law enforcement to educate the public, and anyone who is contemplating purchasing a counterfeit ID online, on the potential dangers of sharing your personal identifiable information with a criminal element.\u201d\n\nHow do we know these IDs will be used to oppose Trump? Because U.S. intelligence officials have said recently that Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has been bested regularly by our top negotiator president, wants the hapless Joe Biden to win in November; he knows he can manipulate Biden, whose son reportedly has ties to a Chinese state-run bank.\n\n\u201cWilliam Evanina, who leads the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said that the U.S. government has assessed that China prefers President Trump losing the election, because Beijing considers him \u2018unpredictable,\u2019 while Russia is working to undermine Democrat Joe Biden,\u201d NPR reported this week.\n\nIf China can mass-ship fake IDs into the U.S., you better believe that the 2020 election is definitely in play.\n\nSources include:\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nFox10Phoenix.com\n\nCPB.gov"}}
