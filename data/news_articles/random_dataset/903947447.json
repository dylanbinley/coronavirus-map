At the same time, Burkholder\u2019s Country Market in Spring Mills was granted $718,800 to construct a $1.8 million solar carport array.\n\nIn October 2019, Penn State\u2019s Office of Physical Plant celebrated the completion of a solar project along Orchard Road next to Mount Nittany Medical Center. The project will provide University Park with 1 percent of its electricity needs, while also serving as a living lab for students, according to the university.\n\nIn May 2019, the Centre County Board of Commissioners approved a $1.67-million contract to install a solar array at the Centre County Correctional Facility.\n\nAlso last year, the University Area Joint Authority launched a solar energy project that will be, upon completion, the largest municipal-hosted solar installation in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Millheim Borough Council voted in December 2019 to approve investing $100,000 into powering the borough buildings with solar energy.\n\nAnd in Philipsburg, Organic Climbing has made \u201cSolar Sewn\u201d the company\u2019s tagline and business model. The manufacturing facility (which also produces Nittany Mountain Works products) has 5,000 square feet of solar panels on its roof and plans to add more this summer.\n\n\u2018We value renewable energy\u2019\n\nCorl Street, Spring Creek, and Radio Park elementary schools in State College plan to use solar panels for about 10-15 percent of their buildings\u2019 energy use.\n\nJason Little, the school district\u2019s assistant director of the physical plant, says the district passed a resolution in 2008 to have all new building projects reach a minimum certification of LEED Silver. \u201cLEED\u201d stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design and is a system used to rate how \u201cgreen\u201d buildings are. Little says one of the reasons the district applied for grant money to install solar panels is to help with the LEED accreditation.\n\n\u201cAnother reason, solar being a renewable energy, our board recognizes the benefit of being a leader in the Centre County community and pushing to be a leader in our buildings,\u201d says Little. \u201cThey felt there was a value not just in energy savings, but in a visual aspect, that we as a district, we as a community, value renewable energy.\u201d\n\n\u2018Set the county up for success\u2019\n\nThe solar energy project at the Centre County Correctional Facility is ongoing, and Centre County Board of Commissioners Chairman Mike Pipe says, \u201cEverything is in place for an exciting construction season in the next few months.\u201d\n\nThe solar project, which had an official groundbreaking ceremony last week, is part of an energy-savings initiative that has been in progress for several years, he says.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really looking at is energy savings long-term,\u201d Pipe says. \u201cWe\u2019re always going to have a county jail, we\u2019re always going to have an administrative building, we\u2019re always going to have a courthouse, so we knew that if we were going to be looking at a savings over the next 30 or 40 years \u2013 we know we\u2019re not going to be commissioners in 40 years, but we\u2019re still going to be a county, and we want to set the county up for success. [We] identified the fact that there could be savings eventually, and we want it to go in that direction.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pipe, the savings timeline is dependent upon \u201ca few variables\u201d and it will likely be six to 10 years before there is a payback from the switch to solar. The price of Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) is one thing that will determine how much taxpayers will save and when, Pipe says. SRECs are sold on the market, often to entities needing to meet renewable-energy mandate requirements, and the prices of these credits fluctuate.\n\nCommissioner Steve Dershem voted against the solar contract, citing concerns about the financial guarantees and longevity of the project.\n\n\u201cAny time you enter into any contract or any sort of service long-term, there are always going to be concerns about warranty issues, replacement, maintenance of the project,\u201d Pipe says, \u201cso [we did] a lot of due diligence over about two years before we signed the contract.\u201d\n\nThe county is going to include on its website (centrecountypa.gov) data that is constantly updated so people can see how much energy the solar panels are producing, he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to track this decision and see the hard metrics,\u201d Pipe says. \u201cI think that helps with the ongoing conversation, so it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re one and done. The key thing is to keep people in the loop and have a conversation about the benefits of this.\u201d\n\n\u2018We use a lot of energy here\u2019\n\nCory Miller, the University Area Joint Authority\u2019s (UAJA) executive director, says the solar arrays (that include a 1.5-megawatt storage battery) have been a long time coming.\n\n\u201cWe use a lot of energy here, and we have thought it would be nice to figure out a way to do it without burning so many fossil fuels,\u201d says Miller. \u201cAfter several tries, we found a way to financially make it work, so that\u2019s when we actually contracted with a third party to install the solar array and the storage batteries. \u2026 We\u2019re actually expected to save some money over the entire length of the project, over what we would be spending if we were using conventional electricity, and the municipalities of the Centre Region have been one after the other passing goals for renewable energy, and the Council of Governments is also involved in that \u2026 [and] the UAJA wants to help as much as we can.\u201d\n\nMiller says the authority expects to realize more than $2 million in savings over the life of the project, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s a conservative estimate. We know we\u2019re going to do better than that.\u201d\n\n\u2018It makes business sense\u2019\n\nJosh Helke, Organic Climbing\u2019s founder, says people stop by his light-filled, open-concept factory space each week to ask about the solar panels. The company\u2019s solar energy powers the entire operation during most of the year, and Helke says beyond a marketing tactic to the typically \u201cgreenwashed\u201d outdoor industry, solar is also good business.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just doing this to do good for the world; it makes business sense not to be paying an electric bill,\u201d Helke says. \u201cOur projected time to pay off our solar panels was 15 years, but now it\u2019s down to seven. When we\u2019ve started to use them, we\u2019ve noticed they\u2019re way better than we thought they were going to be. \u2026 I think it\u2019s really taken off here, which is great, and the more people who do it, the more people realize it isn\u2019t some pipe dream, trying to make a political statement; it\u2019s actually a thing to do to save money and really have some influence.\u201d\n\nHelke says his company is getting to the size \u201cwhere we can share our vision,\u201d and Organic Climbing will soon be working with business school students at Penn State who are interested in the sustainability aspect of the company.\n\n\u201cIronically, this whole facility is built on an old [strip mine], so it\u2019s cool that now it\u2019s come full-circle and it\u2019s now reclaimed, and the first \u2013 to the best of our knowledge \u2013 fully solar-powered sewing facility is sitting on it,\u201d Helke says.\n\n(Photo by Darren Andrew Weimert) Organic Climbing founder Josh Helke on the roof of his facility in Philipsburg.\n\nRising residential solar\n\nAndy Porter, solar sales manager at Envinity Inc. in State College, says his company has seen \u201ca significant increase in residential solar projects in Centre County and throughout PA.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Envinity, we have tripled our installation capacity over the past three years and are continually seeking to hire solar installers,\u201d Porter says. \u201cHomeowners are realizing that solar makes sense financially and is a very tangible way to reduce their carbon footprint.\u201d\n\nPorter says most solar systems fall under a 25-year warranty.\n\n\u201cMost people can expect their systems to pay for themselves in the range of five to 12 years,\u201d says Porter. \u201cThe systems are simple and mostly maintenance-free, and will generate a bit of income through Solar Renewable Energy Credits.\u201d\n\nSolar advantages and concerns\n\nSolar energy is touted as being cleaner and less expensive than fossil fuels, but initially installing solar systems can be expensive. There is also concern over the availability of the rare earth metals necessary to produce solar panels and batteries, as well as the money, time, and potential environmental toll inherent in mining them.\n\nThere is also the fact that the sun doesn\u2019t shine for 24 hours a day. Alan Reppert, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, says there are times in Pennsylvania when the clouds are so dense, a solar panel \u201cmay struggle to get any\u201d power from solar cells.\n\nReppert adds, however, \u201cEven though we might not be seeing the sun, there is still some incoming solar radiation to help with producing power.\u201d\n\nPorter also warns of misleading advertisements that offer \u201cspecial programs for free solar.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are usually lease programs in which the lease company increases the price they charge you each year for the energy their panels generate on your home,\u201d Porter says. \u201cThis also means you are not eligible for any tax benefits, and the lease company gets the Renewable Energy Credits. So, no matter if you decide to invest in solar or go with a lease, make sure you do your research.\u201d\n\nSolar incentives in Pennsylvania\n\nThe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania offers multiple grants and loan programs to promote the use of solar energy, and there are also tax incentives available at the state and local levels.\n\n\u201cAs far as current relevant legislation and federal programs go, there is currently a 26-percent federal income tax credit available for installing a solar energy system,\u201d Porter says. \u201cThis will reduce to 22 percent in 2021 and go away entirely in 2022. In 2019, the PA House of Representatives introduced HB531 to allow community solar. This is a bipartisan effort, which will allow PA residents who don't own property or whose properties do not have good solar potential to invest into a community solar facility. There is also a strong effort to require more of Pennsylvania's energy to come from solar.\u201d\n\nTeresa Mull is a freelance writer in Philipsburg."}}
