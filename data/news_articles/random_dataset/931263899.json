Putting together the resources we collectively have to meet the needs we collectively have.\u201d\n\nFunds are to be distributed weekly in rounds. The first round focuses on community members in southern Vermont and southwestern New Hampshire. Round two will focus on \u201cthose who are living elsewhere in rural Vermont and rural New England.\u201d\n\nAfter, if funds are still available, the funding will alternate weekly between the two areas \u201cas we continue to raise funds and as long as folks are applying for funds,\u201d said Eva Westheimer, programs and volunteer coordinator.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really all in with making sure this mutual aid fund serves the maximum number of people,\u201d said Ain Thompson, the organization\u2019s director of development and outreach.\n\nAccording to Westheimer, the group was inspired by \u201ca number of other mutual aid funds popping up across the country\u201d in light of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n\u201cWe found that there was such a need and desire from the community to have a fund like this, specifically in this time right now,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cThis was something that the community wanted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all doing what we can.\u201d Lozito said. \u201cSometimes we need, and sometimes we can give. It\u2019s a cycle.\u201d\n\nThe program is part of a larger, mutual aid fund that, in turn, is part of Out in the Open\u2019s Rural Queer Community Network, a larger effort to connect queer people to provide assistance other than financial.\n\nFor example, members of the network can ask others to run errands if they are immunocompromised, or they can get assistance with making phone calls or appointments.\n\nThe network also organizes a phone tree for emotional check-ins to stave off isolation by making sure that members call one another and stay connected with their local communities.\n\n\u201cIsolation and its effects are made worse by a lack of connection to other queer or trans folks in the town or county,\u201d said Out in the Open in the press release. \u201cMany [queer people] may not be in contact with families of origin and/or may be quarantined in unsupportive households.\u201d\n\n\u201cOut in the Open has been doing movement building and community connecting work with rural LGBTQ folks since 2012,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cIt\u2019s new for us to have a mutual aid fund, which is why we\u2019re excited for it.\u201d\n\nFundraising so far has been successful. While Out in the Open staff haven\u2019t set a hard goal, they were hoping to get at least $10,000. In the first week of the fund being open, they raised $6,500 from at least 50 donors. Since then, the fund has raised another $1,200, with another $1,200 being brought in from Out in the Open\u2019s operating budget.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really exciting and people from all over the country are helping out,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cI just feel grateful to the community both for asking for what they need and sharing what they have. I feel kind of humbled by our community.\u201d"}}
