I was so overwhelmed and so happy for Aaron being recognised.\n\n\u201cWe sat Aaron down to tell him and he replied \u2018really, me? Oh, that\u2019s really nice but it\u2019s okay, they can give it to other children. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m anything special\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe reassured him he was a very worthy winner and so did the team who voted for him.\n\n\u201cHe asked if he could collect the award for all the other ROHHAD kids and his best friend Lucca, who passed away from ROHHAD.\n\n\u201cFor Aaron, it has never been about him. Even if you ask him what superhero power he would like to have, he says he would like healing powers so he make all the other children better.\n\n(Image: Shared Content Unit)\n\n\u201cHe says he would be Flash so he can run into the future to get the cure and then bring it back to fix everyone.\u201d\n\nThe syndrome causes previously normal healthy children to gain weight and have breathing difficulties as well as other problems.\n\nThe life-limiting condition is extremely rare, with only around 100 cases determined worldwide.\n\nThe youngster has come up with a number of ways to raise money for the charity, including the Go Mad Jump for ROHHAD campaign, which saw famous figures, including Nicola Sturgeon and Robert Downey Jr jump in a muddy puddle.\n\nElisabeth says picking up the award will be a huge feat for Aaron, who she said was feeling nervous about the ceremony.\n\nShe explained: \u201cIf Aaron was to be selfish about it, he wouldn\u2019t go. He doesn\u2019t like being in a crowded room full of people. Autism is often a dual diagnosis alongside ROHHAD. Aaron suffers badly from social anxiety but he is willing to do this if it helps other kids.\n\n\u201cI saw a lovely Stan Lee quote that really describes Aaron and it is \u2018That person who helps others simply because it should or must be done, and because it is the right thing to do, is indeed without a doubt, a real superhero\u2019.\n\n\u201cAaron is our superhero and we are extremely proud of him.\u201d\n\nElisabeth said Aaron is extremely excited about the release of more than \u00a3300,000 to research teams across the world, who are aiming to discover what causes ROHHAD.\n\nThe charity received four bids from scientists across America and Europe, which they hope to eventually fully fund.\n\n(Image: DAILY MIRROR)\n\nMoney will be released to the first of the teams, based in Chicago, on November 4 but the charity needs to double what it has already raised within the year to complete the first round of funding.\n\nElisabeth explained: \u201cAaron has said it\u2019s the best birthday present he could have and we are so excited to be at this stage as we are ahead of our five-year plan.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to fund all four teams because the hypotheses are all slightly different. One of them will be right and we are confident of that.\n\n\u201cIf we can find that, we will solve one of the mysteries of ROHHAD and work towards improving the quality of life of sufferers, prolonging their life and ultimately finding a cure.\u201d\n\nThe development is a huge boost to Aaron, who has been especially poorly lately as his disease progresses.\n\nHe is preparing to undergo major surgery to improve his quality of life but it will involve a lengthy stay in hospital.\n\nElisabeth explained: \u201cROHHAD has become increasingly more difficult for Aaron over the past six months and as his disease progresses, it has been taking its toll on his body physically, restricting his day to day living and quality of life.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t go ahead with this surgery Aaron will continue to suffer and he will lose his life sooner. Aaron knows his own prognosis is that he is unlikely to reach adulthood we all know this but Aaron deserves this chance to improve his quality of life for however long he may have left and the surgery will do this and may even prolong his life further too.\n\n\u201cAll of this is giving him something positive to focus on and we are all so grateful for the support, especially our local community who have been amazing.\u201d"}}
