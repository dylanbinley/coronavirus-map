He has also spoken to Quebec Premier Francois Legault and Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, he said.\n\n\u201cWe all feel the same way,\u201d Ford said. \u201cWe need to unite this country, because what is good for Canada is good for Ontario.\u201d\n\nGovernment House Leader Paul Calandra said the recent election is part of what prompted everyone to be more civil.\n\n\u201cI think we looked at the tone of the last federal campaign, we heard what people had to say about that and I think there is an effort on both sides to live up to what Ontarians and broadly what Canadians asked us to do - work together a bit better,\u201d he said.\n\nThat said, standing ovations won't be banned, Calandra said.\n\n\u201cI don't want to take the passion out of the place,\u201d he said. \u201c(But) we've been here a year now on the government side...I think it's going to take a little bit more to get us up on our feet than it would have when we were all brand new.\u201d\n\nInterim Liberal Leader John Fraser said Monday before question period that those changes would be nice, but what he wants is a change in priorities.\n\n\u201cTone will not replace those things that Ontario's families depend on, the things that have been lost in the last year,\u201d he said, referring to cuts made by Ford's government, such as slashing teacher jobs.\n\nNDP Leader Andrea Horwath said \u201ctime will tell\u201d if the government members continue to behave.\n\n\u201cWhen people in Ontario see their hospitals funded properly, their long-term care homes funded properly, their kids getting what they need to graduate in school...that's when Ontarians will put on a happy face,\u201d she said.\n\nHorwath got in a dig about \u201cfinally\u201d being able to ask Ford questions again, with her first question about the government's plan to cut 10,000 teacher jobs from the system due to higher class sizes.\n\nEducation Minister Stephen Lecce said a $1.6-billion attrition protection fund the government has set aside will be more than enough to ensure that no teacher involuntarily loses their job.\n\nThe resumption of the legislative session comes amid tough bargaining with the province's education sector. The unions representing high school teachers, elementary teachers, and English Catholic teachers are all holding strike votes. A strike by support staff was narrowly avoided earlier this month when the Canadian Union of Public Employees reached a deal with the province, agreeing to a one-per-cent wage increase for its 55,000 education workers.\n\nLecce has offered to scale back the province's push to increase class sizes - from 28 to 25 for high school - as part of bargaining with the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation, but the union called it a \u201cpoison pill.\u201d\n\nLabour unions and other activists organized a protest Monday to decry various cuts and changes enacted by the government, with dozens of vehicles and people encircling the legislature.\n\nThe major piece of legislation that the government left on the table before the summer break is one that would limit wage increases to an average of one per cent a year for three years for the broader public sector.\n\nThe government introduced a new piece of legislation Monday to eliminate and streamline regulations, including loosening restrictions on the hours airport bars can serve alcohol and how much booze Ontarians can bring home from other provinces.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 28, 2019."}}
