On Friday, there was an open Town Hall discussion focusing on development issues and challenges in the multi-island motherland, SVG, while on Saturday, October 26, there was the annual Independence Banquet and Dance.\n\nThe Banquet is an annual affair and was addressed by President of the Association, Arlene Greene who urged young Vincentians to play a more active role and to continue the 43-year old legacy of the organisation. She also outlined the number of initiatives by the organisation to assist the people of the homeland and pledged to continue in these efforts.\n\nGuest of the Association this year was veteran Vincentian social activist and journalist, Renwick Rose. He facilitated the Friday night discussion and delivered the keynote address at the Banquet, which was well attended."}}
