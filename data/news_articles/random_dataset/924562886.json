We just didn't mention it before. That's all done. Maybe we'll release it,\" he teased.\n\nHe added: \"No, we are\u2026 I don't know, really. Again, I love everybody involved in it so much, and we all still talk, and we've got a hilarious WhatsApp group.\n\n\"And, you know, I can't imagine not doing something with them ever again. I don't know if it would be The Inbetweeners.\"\n\nDuring the interview Damon admitted that a reunion has been the topic of conversation.\n\n\"Yeah. We always talk about it, don't we? It's hard to say.\n\n\"The main stumbling block would be us, because we haven't got any ideas for it that would do it justice.\"\n\n\"If we could think of something and thought, 'Oh, that's a brilliant idea for those four characters!' I think it would be the easiest thing in the world to just go back there and do it.\n\n\"If Iain keeps having children, he's going to need to probably work well into his 60s and maybe his 70s.\"\n\nThe Inbetweeners ran for three-season starting in 2008 and had 2 highly successful movies.\n\nThe show starred Joe Thomas (Simon), James Buckley (Jay), Simon Bird (Will), and Blake Harrison (Neil). The sitcom was a huge success and was even honoured at the BAFTA TV awards."}}
