In Hebrew, Bethlehem means \"house of bread.\" An American Indian name for Lehigh is Lecha, which is similar to lechem. Some historians believe that Zinzendorf may have wanted to add another layer of meaning beyond the biblical reference: House (Beth) on the Lehigh (Lechem). It forms a Hebrew-American Indian compound. The Moravians would go on to minister to Indians, setting up the Nain village in what is now west Bethlehem."}}
