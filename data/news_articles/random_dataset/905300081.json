Lawrence Ray is facing a multitude of felony charges, including sex trafficking, extortion, and forced labor, among others.\n\nSarah Lawrence College is an elite, private liberal arts university in Yonkers. It was there that an unidentified female student enrolled and moved into student housing. Some time afterward, in 2010, the woman\u2019s father, Lawrence Ray, now 60, an ex-con, allegedly moved into the building.\n\nThere, federal authorities say, Ray began to ingratiate himself into the lives of the school\u2019s most vulnerable students. He allegedly began preaching his \u201cpersonal philosophy\u201d to the students, then inviting them for \u201ctherapy sessions.\u201d During those so-called therapy sessions, he would allegedly learn intimate details of the students\u2019 lives.\n\nHe also allegedly convinced the young adults that they were \u201cbroken\u201d and in need of \u201cfixing,\u201d and would allegedly isolate the students from their families.\n\nThe \u201ctherapy sessions\u201d eventually morphed into sexual, financial, and physical abuse, authorities say. For example, Ray would convince the students that they owed him money for this reason or that. Using sleep deprivation, psychological and sexual humiliation, verbal abuse, physical violence, and threats of legal action, Ray would allegedly get the students to make false confessions of damaging his property\u2013 confessions which he would then allegedly hold over their heads to force their compliance.\n\nArrested and Indicted:\n\nLawrence Ray is charged with sex trafficking, extortion, forced labor, and other offenses for running a sex cult at Sarah Lawrence College.\n\n@ABC7NY pic.twitter.com/WjVz7PvTSR \u2014 Sandra Bookman (@SandraBookman7) February 11, 2020\n\nOne young woman, for example, was convinced that she owed Ray half a million dollars, for which she was allegedly forced into prostitution to pay back. Other young women were allegedly cruelly punished for such misdemeanors as bringing him cold food. Ray allegedly held a knife to the throat of a young man to get him to confess to a nonexistent crime.\n\nRay\u2019s other alleged victims were forced into labor to \u201cpay off\u201d the imagined debt they incurred after they confessed to damaging his properties.\n\nRay has since been arrested and is now facing federal charges of sex trafficking, extortion, and forced labor.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not angry, you don\u2019t have a soul,\u201d said William Sweeney Jr., assistant director-in-charge of the FBI in New York.\n\nSarah Lawrence College, for its part, issued a statement stating that it had investigated similar claims against Ray on its own and could not substantiate them.\n\n\u201cAs always the safety and well-being of our students and alumni is a priority for the College,\u201d the statement says in part."}}
