But it\u2019s the kind of news that makes me crazy \u2013 because it is absolutely outrageous that Miami taxpayers are on the hook for the legal fees even though the work at the center of the suit was done prior to him becoming a City of Miami commissioner.\n\nI\u2019m no rocket scientist, but I have a question: Why are Miami residents, some being the poorest in the entire country, being forced to put their pennies together to pay for this scofflaw\u2019s alleged bad behavior?\n\nOh wait \u2013 did you hear that hiss? That\u2019s the sound of a car tire going flat after pounding into a pothole that wasn\u2019t repaired because Miami\u2019s money was spent on Joe\u2019s legal bills.\n\nOh, and that\u2019s the burglar alarm going off at your local cafecito shop for the last four hours, because covering Joe\u2019s legal bills means one fewer police officer on the street.\n\nThink about it: Miami doesn\u2019t have money to enhance city services because Joe Carollo asked \u2013 and got \u2013 Miami to pay for legal bills tied to his private lobbying business. Like any banana republic dictator, he just puts the burden on the people, forcing them to shell out cash to cover his mistakes. I say only a coward would hide behind the city, tapping its resources to protect him.\n\nHow did we get here, you might ask? Prior to returning to the city commission in November 2017, Carollo was a lobbyist for a company seeking to build a Ferris wheel at Bayside Marketplace, which is a city of Miami property. Once Crazy Joe became a commissioner, the contract ended. But that didn\u2019t stop him from using his inside information to squeeze his former employer to hand over more money to the city.\n\nThat\u2019s a breach of contract, his former employer said in the lawsuit filed last year.\n\nAnother BIG Question why didn\u2019t Lobbyist-Joe formally register with the city, as lobbyists are required to do? We know why \u2013 because he didn\u2019t want transparency!\n\nHe doesn\u2019t follow rules. He\u2019s like a dictator in waiting. Just like the time he failed to pull permits for his house.\n\nIn January, his former employer Platinum Advisors filed another suit against the City of Miami to stop the city from paying Crazy Joe legal bills.\n\nBut listen, apparently Miami is printing up money these days, right? Or, is it as Joe Carollo says regularly, that the City needs to tighten its belt.\n\nDon\u2019t fret though. Worst-case scenario is, if Miami runs out of money covering for Joe\u2019s private lobbying mistakes, taxpayers can always pitch in a little more for Crazy Joe."}}
