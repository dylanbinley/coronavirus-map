Pundits say maybe a little", "TEXT": "J.D. Prose\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Tuesday chose U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris to be his running mate this fall, but vice presidential picks rarely matter in determining election results, said political scientists.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of evidence that vice president candidates have a big impact,\u201d said Christopher Borick, a political science professor and director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Allentown.\n\nHarris, a California Democrat, sought the party\u2019s presidential nomination, but dropped out in December. She is the first woman of color to run on a major party\u2019s ticket.\n\nBorick and two contemporaries, Franklin and Marshall College\u2019s Terry Madonna and Chatham University\u2019s Jennie Sweet-Cushman, said last week that, while the media and political operatives love to predict and dissect the vice president sweepstakes, whoever it is rarely moves the needle among voters in any significant way.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it matters all that much,\u201d said Sweet-Cushman, an assistant professor at Chatham in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe lone example Borick and Madonna, a professor and the director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall in Lancaster, gave of a vice president candidate having an impact was John F. Kennedy choosing Lyndon B. Johnson as his running mate in 1960 in an ultimately successful play to win Texas.\n\n\u201cMost important: almost no one votes for a president candidate because of the VP running mate,\u201d Madonna said. \u201cBest rule for a VP candidate is, \u2018Do no harm.\u2019\u201d\n\nSweet-Cushman added that having a Black woman on the ticket could possibly help Biden increase Black voter turnout in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The question, she said, is whether Harris can convince Black men who voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 to now go with Biden.\n\nMore:Biden slams Trump during Pa. stop for defending Confederate flag\n\n\u201cWe have to remember that 14 percent of black men voted for Trump, and a whole lot more stayed home,\u201d said Sweet-Cushman, who offered that it was not so much a racial factor with Hillary Clinton, but \u201cmore sexism at play.\u201d\n\nBorick said this year is \u201ca little different\u201d because Biden is 77 and has referred to himself as a \u201ctransitional figure\u201d away from Trump and back to more traditional governing. In that context, he said the vice president pick \u201ctakes on more of an importance\u201d as she could be seen as a leading 2024 presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cGenerally, you don\u2019t want to do any harm,\u201d Borick said of a running mate, \u201cand you want someone who\u2019s going to be a good partner.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the vice presidential pool when Harris, from California, and former Obama administration official Susan Rice were considered the top finalists, Sweet-Cushman said Harris was a \u201csafe bet\u201d for Biden with her experience in the Senate and background as a prosecutor.\n\nMore:Biden, Trump make new push to win voters in battleground Pennsylvania\n\n\u201cBy far, Kamala Harris is the best campaigner and has the energy and enthusiasm to go out and do campaign rallies, but we\u2019re not going to do that in 2020,\u201d Sweet-Cushman said.\n\nBorick said Harris was \u201cbattle-tested\u201d from her presidential primary run. \u201cShe certainly has a voting record that aligns pretty nicely with the preferences of the left,\u201d he said.\n\nOne stumbling block, Madonna noted, is Harris\u2019 time as a prosecutor, which could turn off some left-leaning voters. \u201cShe was a tough prosecutor as AG in California,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could present a problem for her.\u201d\n\nMadonna described Harris as being \u201cpretty much a progressive on the major issues.\u201d\n\nOverall, Borick said Harris would be a benefit for Biden in Pennsylvania. \u201cShe would have nice appeal in areas like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh where individuals are looking to have that different perspective in terms of gender, race and age,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a Twitter post, Biden called Harris \u201ca fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country\u2019s finest public servants.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Sharif Street, D-Philadelphia, the vice chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, also posted congratulations to Harris on Twitter, adding, \u201cI look forward to working with this dynamic team to take back the White House & turn PA #BackToBlue.\u201d\n\nU.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Scranton, released a statement in which he said Harris \u201cwill be an excellent vice president\u201d and praised her work in Congress.\n\n\u201cIn the Senate, she\u2019s been a leader on efforts to help working families make ends meet and reform policing in America,\u201d Casey said in a statement. \u201cAs a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, she\u2019s held the Trump administration accountable. I know she will fight for Pennsylvania families and jobs as vice president.\"\n\nTrump campaign senior adviser Katrina Pierson derided Harris and claimed she would \u201cbury her record as a prosecutor\u201d to appeal to \u201canti-police extremists\u201d among Democrats.\n\n\u201cIn her failed attempt at running for president, Kamala Harris gleefully embraced the left\u2019s radical manifesto, calling for trillions of dollars in new taxes and backing Bernie Sanders\u2019 government takeover of healthcare,\u201d Pierson said in a statement. \u201cShe is proof that Joe Biden is an empty shell being filled with the extreme agenda of the radicals on the left.\u201d\n\nJ.D.
