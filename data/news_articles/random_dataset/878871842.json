It's wacky to think we'd have a treaty text before the October 17 and 18 summit.\"\n\nBut Varadkar appears to be looking slightly further forward, implying that he and Johnson are now aiming for a deal in the next three weeks.\n\n\"I think it's possible for us to come to an agreement, to have a treaty agreed ... by the end of October,\" he said.\n\nBut he cautioned there could still be obstacles along the way, after a more than three-year game of high-stakes political snakes and ladders.\n\n\"There's many a slip between cup and lip,\" he warned.\n\nJohnson has vowed Britain will end its five-decade membership of the EU on October 31, with or without agreeing exit terms.\n\nBut he could be forced to seek a third delay to Brexit if he fails to agree a deal by October 19, thanks to a law passed by rebellious MPs.\n\nSome European sources in Brussels have suggested that EU leaders may offer Britain an extension even if Johnson does not ask for one.\n\n- Irish border dispute -\n\nSince the 2016 British referendum vote for Brexit, negotiations have bounced back and forth between London and Brussels.\n\nBut Ireland has been a key player because of the issue of the UK's only land border, between its province of Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nJohnson and Varadkar met at Thornton Manor, a venue more commonly used for luxury weddings than discussing international divorce terms.\n\nTheir talks \"concentrated on the challenges of customs and consent\", their joint statement said.\n\nAfter British MPs rejected a \"backstop\" plan in a previous withdrawal agreement to keep the border open, Johnson presented a new proposal last week.\n\nHe proposes Northern Ireland stay aligned to the EU's single market but remain in a separate UK-wide customs territory, envisaging customs but no regulatory checks on the frontier.\n\nNorthern Ireland's opt-in to the plan would be open to four-yearly review by the province's devolved assembly and executive.\n\nBut Brussels is adamant it will not agree to any plan that undermines the single market -- which allows free movement of goods across Europe -- or exacerbates tensions on the island of Ireland.\n\nA free-flowing border is considered vital to maintaining peace in Northern Ireland, which was plagued by three decades of violence, largely brought to an end with the 1998 Good Friday peace accords.\n\nburs-ar-dc/cw"}}
