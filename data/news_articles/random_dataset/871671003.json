It relates to issues of financing, returning to the territory of Kyrgyzstan, their release and clarification of citizenship,\u201d he said.\n\nThe question is not only about their return to Kyrgyzstan, but also about their stay at home, reunion with families, and reintegration into society, he added. \u201cWe are here talking about multiple layers of social issues.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s top diplomat said that the negotiations on the return of citizens have reached the finish line.\n\n\u201cThe departure of the governmental delegation is already planned. There is an agreement on the return of our citizens. Today we are talking about 70 children who plan to return from Iraq. However, a final list will be formed locally, subject to parental consent for children,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs for Syria, negotiations with government agencies are actively ongoing. There are territories not fully controlled by the government. Therefore, negotiations are underway with other states that can assist in solving the problem. This issue is under the special control of the head of state and the prime minister.\u201d\n\nKyrgyzstan officials have often stated their country\u2019s determination to \u201cdo everything it can to fight against the evil of terrorism.\u201d"}}
