Staff Photo/PAUL FRANZ\n\nGREENFIELD \u2014 A blog that began as an outlet for chronicling one local student\u2019s experience during a global pandemic has since turned into a platform for connecting her with teenagers from around the world.\n\nGreenfield resident Maya Baudrand, a 14-year-old attending Stoneleigh-Burnham School, recently launched Quaran-teened, a website where she posts her interviews with teenagers about their experience during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cI had never experienced something that affected everybody around the world,\u201d Baudrand said. \u201cI thought it would be more interesting to get perspectives from students everywhere.\u201d\n\nSo far, the eighth-grader has interviewed teenagers from China, the Netherlands, Russia, Croatia, Canada, Italy, England and Germany. She\u2019s also spoken to students in New York and New Hampshire.\n\nAfter she found out her spring break was to be extended, Baudrand started reaching out to friends and acquaintances from around the world, curious to know how her fellow students were doing amid the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI need something to keep me busy,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t expect this to last this long.\u201d\n\nAs someone who has moved a lot with her family, Baudrand said she had already developed a network of connections. The hardest part, she said, is getting people to agree to do the interviews.\n\nSome of the teenagers she has spoken with are friends from schools she\u2019s attended, such as Lyc\u00e9e, an independent French school in New York, while others are people she\u2019s meeting for the first time over a video call. Many of the connections she makes, she said, are through parents who hear about her project and ask their children to reach out to her.\n\nBaudrand said the blogging project has even allowed her to reconnect with a girl she met as a child in France during a trip to visit family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really fun for me to do it, because I get to meet these new people,\u201d or in other cases, \u201cre-meet\u201d them, she said.\n\nOver the course of her interviews, she said she\u2019s found that a lot of the experiences of people she\u2019s encountered have been similar to her own.\n\n\u201cEven though we\u2019re all around the world, a lot of the things we\u2019re doing are almost identical,\u201d Baudrand said. \u201cWe\u2019re staying home, having the same issue of having to deal with your family 24/7.\u201d\n\nAnd just like her, students are spending free time on Netflix, or watching and creating TikTok videos.\n\nBaudrand has been most interested to learn about different approaches to remote learning, or how quarantine is being enforced more in some places than it is in others. She noted a conversation she had with a Chinese student in the middle of her 14-day quarantine, who, mid-interview, had to respond to a health check from an official at her door.\n\n\u201cI enjoy documenting things and watching them later,\u201d she said. \u201cI want this be useful after the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe Quaran-teened website will also be used as a platform for posting humorous videos or other light-hearted content. Baudrand is in the process of starting a podcast to complement the video content she shares.\n\n\u201cIt could go in any direction,\u201d she said.\n\nMary Byrne can be reached at mbyrne@recorder.com or 413-772-0261, ext. 263.
