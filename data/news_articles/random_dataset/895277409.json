Governments have an obligation to ensure that all people can freely enjoy the universal human rights and fundamental freedoms to which they are entitled.\"\n\nAmbassador Foote said last month that he was horrified by the 15-year prison sentence a Zambian court handed out to two men for having sex in what the court said was \"against the order of nature.\"\n\nWhen Zambian officials criticized Foote's reaction, he said all they want are diplomats \"with open pocketbooks and closed mouths.\"\n\nZambia has not yet commented on Foote's withdrawal. Zambia gets $500m in US aid every year. Foote had also earlier accused Zambian government officials of \"stealing millions of dollars in public funds.\""}}
