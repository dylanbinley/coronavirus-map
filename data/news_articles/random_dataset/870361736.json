The previous quota was valid for two years, Reuters reported . Raising the quota will benefit the US, which is the largest producer of the ethanol in the world.Brazil sugar industry association UNICA welcomed the decision, stating: \u201cIt was important for Brazil to make a gesture in favour of trade openness with the US, with whom we\u2019re seeking a broad free trade agreement.\u201dHowever, US ethanol trade association Growth Energy was less enthusiastic, with CEO Emily Skor saying: \u201cWe appreciate the US Government's efforts to raise the TRQ, however we are disappointed that Brazil did not remove their tariff completely to allow a fully open market.\u201cBrazilian ethanol continues to have virtual tariff-free access to the US and puts US ethanol producers at a disadvantage at a time when they need it most. We will continue working with US Government officials, the Brazilian Government, and our allies to truly open the ethanol market and build a strong trade relationship for decades to come.\u201dRyan LeGrand, president and CEO of the US Grains Council, which works to develop export markets for US corn, also expressed disappointment at the Brazilian Government\u2019s decision to keep in place the TRQ. \"We are very disappointed Brazil did not fully consider the vast information we and the US Government provided them showing the detrimental and negative impact this TRQ has on Brazilian consumers by raising prices at the pump,\u201d LeGrand said.\u201cWe will actively encourage review of this policy, which inhibits trade between our countries and hinders the development of a robust global ethanol marketplace. Free and reciprocal fair trade between the world\u2019s two largest ethanol producers should be a model for other countries to follow. Instead Brazil is showing other countries a path to construct barriers to trade, which will hurt all consumers in the short, medium and long terms.\"Renewable Fuels Association president and CEO Geoff Cooper drew attention to the \u2018unfair and unlevel\u2019 playing field created by Brazilian trade barriers. He commented: \u201cBrazil\u2019s decision to maintain its protectionist trade barrier against US ethanol is extremely disappointing and represents a major setback in our relationship with the Brazilian sugar and ethanol industry.\u201cThe token increase in the quota does nothing to provide relief to Brazilian consumers who face higher fuel prices because of Brazil\u2019s discriminatory policy. Not only is the US market wide open to ethanol imports from Brazil, but our Renewable Fuel Standard actually incentivises imports by characterising sugarcane ethanol as an advanced biofuel.\u201cBut there is nothing \u2018advanced\u2019 at all about the unfair and unlevel playing created by Brazilian trade barriers. In light of Brazil\u2019s action, it may be time for US policymakers to reconsider our open-door trade policy regarding sugarcane ethanol.\u201d"}}
