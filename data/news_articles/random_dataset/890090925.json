With each court date \u2015 there have been three so far \u2015 the wait grows longer.\n\n\u00a9 Mark Lambie/El Paso Times The 1-year-old son of Honduran asylum-seeker Francisco Echevarria rides a Thomas the Train toy around the courtyard of the Pasos de Fe shelter in Ju\u00e1rez on Tuesday. Shelters in Ju\u00e1rez are seeing less migrants arriving, but many are left as they await their hearings.\n\n\u201cThey just delay and delay,\u201d said the 33-year-old Honduran. \u201cI think they want us to give up. And there isn\u2019t any assurance that we\u2019ll be successful.\u201d\n\nLife in this border city\u2019s 17 nonprofit migrant shelters has been transformed by the U.S. program that keeps asylum-seekers waiting for months on end for court dates in El Paso.\n\nOnce a quick stop for the deported to get a night\u2019s rest and a shower, the city\u2019s shelters have become long-term homes for Cuban and Central American families committed to pursuing their claims under MPP.\n\nThirty people, including the Echevarr\u00eda family, have spent months at the Pasos de Fe Presbyterian shelter in a neighborhood southwest of downtown.\n\n\u201cBefore, the most we would let people stay was 15 days,\u201d said Miguel Gonzalez, a pastor and director of three Presbyterian shelters in Ju\u00e1rez. But the shelter has extended its hospitality, he said, because \u201cwe have seen court dates set into April 2020.\u201d\n\n1,486 in Ju\u00e1rez nonprofit shelters\n\nThe shelter\u2019s doors open onto uneven streets of dirt and rock, where rainwater cuts deep gullies.\n\nA washing machine rattled on a back patio as it spun in the afternoon. Clothes dried overhead on a barbed wire line. Inside, Echevarr\u00eda\u2019s wife shooed her son away from a pressure cooker filled with pinto beans, while other children squealed in the next room playing a made-up game.\n\nMexican authorities counted 1,486 people in the city\u2019s network of nonprofit shelters in late November \u2015 about 200 people more than were sheltered in July, near the height of arrivals. Shelter directors say that a majority of their residents are people committed to pursuing their asylum claims under the MPP process.\n\nEchevarr\u00eda, who has attended every one of his court hearings in El Paso, is one of the 3,491 asylum-seekers caught in the MPP dragnet, according to a count by the TRAC Research Center at Syracuse University.\n\nBut hopes are wearing thin among those committed to the long wait in Ju\u00e1rez: Not a single applicant under MPP has been granted asylum in the El Paso immigration court through September, according to data compiled by TRAC.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to keep waiting only for them to deport me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy for us to stay here.\u201d\n\nWant more news like this?

But they were subjected to MPP and sent back to Mexico.\n\nWith his first court date set for September, he took a job in Ciudad Madera, five hours south of Ju\u00e1rez in Chihuahua state. The next two court dates were too close together \u2015 one in October and the next in November \u2015 so the family took up residence in the shelter.\n\nEchevarr\u00eda is an electrician and HVAC technician but hasn\u2019t found work yet in Ju\u00e1rez. A company at a job fair this week told him they needed to see a hard copy of his diploma, which he didn\u2019t carry with him.\n\nHe wore a button-down shirt and sweatpants at the shelter as he explained why he took his family north. He had been active in an opposition political party in Honduras and has faced persecution; he believes he lost his job for refusing to attend a presidential visit.\n\n'Honduras is a narco-state'\n\n\"After the last election in 2017, there was fraud and we took to the streets to protest,\" he said. \"First, the police used tear gas, then live bullets. They have disappeared people.\"\n\nHe added: \"The repression continues. Honduras is a narco-state.\"\n\nTwenty-two people were killed by Honduran security forces during the 2017 protests, according to Human Rights Watch, a nonprofit that tracks human rights abuses worldwide. Although homicides have trended downward, violent crime remains rampant.\n\nLast month, the brother of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez was found guilty in a U.S. court of cocaine trafficking, according to the U.S Department of Justice. Juan Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez Alvarado is expected to face sentencing in January.\n\nMexican crackdown slows Central American exodus\n\nThe exodus from Central America to the U.S. border has slowed in recent months, due in part to a crackdown by the Mexican government on its southern border and to the hardship asylum-seekers face in the MPP program.\n\nStill, shelters in Ju\u00e1rez are expanding. Pasos de Fe has outfitted a loft space atop the shelter with blue bunks welded by the migrants themselves, raising capacity to 86 from 46. But the space has so far been left unfinished.\n\nWant more news like this?

Of the 2,616 MPP cases closed in El Paso immigration court, TRAC reports that 2,442, or 93%, have resulted in a removal order.\n\nThe remainder of the cases have been terminated or closed without a deportation, but without asylum being granted.\n\nEchevarr\u00eda's final hearing is scheduled four months from now, in March. That means more waiting, possibly without work. He says going home isn't an option.\n\n\"We don't know what to do now,\" he said. \"But we have to make a decision.\"\n\nLauren Villagran covers the border and can be reached at lvillagran@elpasotimes.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on El Paso Times: Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, shelters host migrants for longer times as US asylum process drags on"}}
