It is extraordinarily sketchy. Draw your own conclusion.\u201d\n\nSumming up for the government, Lord Keen QC continued to argue that the suspension of Parliament was a political matter.\n\nHe told the panel of 11 justices that prorogation was \u201cforbidden territory, which is a matter between the executive and Parliament\u201d, and MPs \u201chad the tools\u201d to change the law if they did not like it.\n\nLord Keen added: \u201cHow in the context of that political minefield is the court to opine on the issue of purpose or improper purpose [of prorogation], legitimate purpose or illegitimate purpose\u2026 how are these concepts to be defined or applied?\n\n\u201cThe applicants are inviting the justices into forbidden territory and an ill-defined minefield, and the courts are not properly equipped to [deal with it].\u201d\n\nBut Lord Pannick QC summed up his case against suspending Parliament by saying the scrutiny of MPs in the run-up to the Brexit deadline at the end of October was \u201cof vital importance\u201d.\n\nHe said that the length of the prorogation \u201cwas motivated, or at least strongly influenced\u201d by Mr Johnson\u2019s belief that Parliament was \u201ca threat to the implementation of his policies\u201d.\n\nThe crossbench peer called for the judges \u2013 if they ruled against the government \u2013 to \u201cmake a declaration that the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen [to prorogue Parliament] was unlawful and to make a declaration as soon as possible\u201d.\n\nAnd, if that declaration was made, that Mr Johnson recalls Parliament next week.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Sir John, Lord Garnier QC said there was evidence that the decision to suspend Parliament was \u201cmotivated by a desire to prevent Parliament interfering with the prime minister\u2019s policies during that period\u201d.\n\nHe argued that prorogation did not just stop MPs from sitting in the House of Commons, but prevented it from carrying out other functions such as putting questions to ministers.\n\nCourt\n\nThe court began hearing submissions on behalf of the Scottish government at 10:30 BST, followed by lawyers for the Northern Ireland victims\u2019 campaigner Raymond McCord and then the Welsh government.\n\nThe Scottish government\u2019s Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC said prorogation was taking place at a \u201ctime-critical period\u201d when the government\u2019s decisions would be \u201cmonumental\u201d.\n\nHe said any decision to prorogue had to have \u201ccogent justification\u201d.\n\nIn a written submission, the Scottish government said prorogation would have a \u201cprofoundly intrusive effect\u201d on Parliament.\n\nRonan Lavery QC, representing Mr McCord, urged the court to look at the impact prorogation would have on Northern Ireland. He said it was designed to \u201crun down the clock\u201d towards a no-deal Brexit which would lead to \u201cthe erection of the border\u201d on the island of Ireland.\n\nSupreme Court president Lady Hale said the court was \u201csolely concerned\u201d with the lawfulnesss of the prime minister\u2019s decision to prorogue Parliament, not arguments about the nature of Brexit.\n\nAnother justice, Lord Wilson, later warned Mr Lavery not to \u201cabuse our politeness or Lady Hale\u2019s patience\u201d by making arguments about Brexit.\n\nIn a written submission, shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti said if the government\u2019s power to prorogue Parliament were left \u201cunchecked\u201d MPs would be \u201cdeprived\u201d of the ability to \u201cperform their constitutional function\u201d.\n\nThe Supreme Court is hearing two appeals.\n\nThe first is led by businesswoman Ms Miller who is appealing against the English High Court\u2019s decision to throw out a challenge to prorogation.\n\nThe judges said the decision to suspend Parliament was \u201cnot a matter\u201d for the judiciary.Gina Miller and SNP MP Joanna Cherry have both led cases against prorogation\n\nThe second comes from the government who are appealing against Scotland\u2019s Court of Session ruling that prorogation was \u201cunlawful\u201d and used to \u201cstymie\u201d Parliament.\n\nThis challenge against the government was brought by 75 parliamentarians including the SNP MP Joanna Cherry.\n\nArguing on behalf of Ms Miller on the first day, Lord Pannick QC said there was \u201cstrong evidence\u201d the PM wanted to \u201csilence\u201d Parliament.\n\nHowever government lawyer Lord Keen QC argued that previous governments had prorogued Parliament to \u201cpursue a particular political objective\u201d and they were \u201centitled to do so\u201d.\n\nOn the second day the court heard from government lawyer Sir James Eadie QC who said the issue was not a matter for the courts.\n\nHe also argued that suspension had not silenced MPs because they had already managed to pass a bill blocking a no-deal Brexit, despite the prorogation dates.\n\nIn the afternoon session, Aidan O\u2019Neil QC said the decision had been carried out \u201cin bad faith\u201d, and \u201cfor an improper purpose\u201d.\n\nLady Hale said the judgement would be delivered early next week.\n\nOne senior government source told the BBC\u2019s political editor No 10 believed the Supreme Court would judge that prorogation was a matter for the courts and would \u201cfire warning shots about how a government should not use this to close Parliament illegitimately\u201d.\n\nHowever, Laura Kuenssberg said according to the source, No 10 did not believe the court would unravel their plan for a Queen\u2019s Speech next month."}}
