In fact, robustness of electoral processes and their digital resilience to manipulation by malicious cyber actors, both domestic and foreign, are becoming very important areas of focus.\n\nFor Microsoft, 2019 marked a year when we made public that we took legal action and technically disrupted operations of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) from Iran (Phosphorus), North Korea (Thallium), China (Barium) or Russia (Strontium).\n\nThese groups have run sophisticated cyber campaigns, aiming to gain access to sensitive information that had the potential to allow them to influence real-world political processes in the US and Europe. Such APTs don\u2019t only target government officials or candidates \u2013 they also attempt to exploit think-tanks that contribute with their research to the electoral processes.\n\nIn order to address this growing threat, AccountGuard was first deployed in the United States in 2018 and later expanded to Canada, India, Australia and 22 European countries ahead of the EU elections last year.\n\nFurther information about AccountGuard is available here.\n\nNew Zealand has become synonymous with the land of strong democratic institutions, human rights and government transparency. Microsoft believes all these values deserve equal protection in both the offline and online worlds. We are looking forward to playing a role in protecting New Zealand\u2019s democracy and the integrity of the upcoming electoral process.\n\nMaciej Surowiec\n\nGovernment Affairs Lead \u2013 New Zealand\n\nMicrosoft"}}
