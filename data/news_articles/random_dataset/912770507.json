But across the country, there are people who are jumping into action to help wherever they can.\n\nFor Mohamed Tarrabin, who manages a jewelry store in Fort McMurray, Alta., the choice to help came last week, when local food banks made the announcement that they were almost out of supplies. People had already started panic-shopping, taking up most of the local supply of non-perishables and toilet paper, leaving little for the community\u2019s most vulnerable, who rely on food banks.\n\nSo Tarrabin\u2019s store, Prestige Jewellery, started offering a promotion, offering free earrings to anyone who dropped off a food donation. It didn\u2019t take long for the idea to take off.\n\n\u201cMy office, the back room, the shelves of my jewelry store are all filled with food now,\u201d he told HuffPost Canada. As of this past weekend, the jewelry store is operating as something of an ad-hoc emergency response centre, where people are dropping off supplies or picking up what they need. The same is true of the store\u2019s Edmonton location, he said.\n\n\u201cShowcases are all full with food,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unreal.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Mohamed Tarrabin Mohamed Tarrabin's back office at Prestige Jewellers in Fort McMurray.\n\nOn Friday, one person dropping off food mentioned to Tarrabin how bad he felt for seniors, who were more at risk of contracting the virus and who might have trouble dealing with long lines and aggressive customers at grocery stores.\n\nSo Tarrabin wrote a post on a local Facebook group, offering to help seniors pick up groceries, medicine, or other essentials.\n\nHe heard back almost right away, mostly from people who lived with their elderly parents but had work responsibilities that prevented them from being full-time caregivers. Since Friday, he\u2019s helped more than 45 people, mainly by picking up prescriptions or in some cases, groceries.\n\nHe\u2019s also heard from about 20 people who reached out to him to tell him they\u2019re doing the same thing.\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images A grocery store with empty shelves in Toronto. As it becomes increasingly difficult to leave the house, community groups are stepping up to help care for the most vulnerable.\n\nFor Toronto resident Amara Possian, the decision to help came from the realization that she didn\u2019t really know a lot of her neighbours. As someone who knew she was young and healthy, she wanted to provide support to the people around her who were more vulnerable, but didn\u2019t have a clear sense of who those people were.\n\nSo early on Friday morning, she wrote a quick note offering help and pointing people towards resources, which she dropped into her neighbours\u2019 mailboxes. She also wrote a sample note she posted to Twitter, so other people could do the same.\n\nI dropped these in my neighbours' mailboxes last night and wanted to share in case the script is helpful. It's really important for us to be there for each other right now, particularly for those who are vulnerable. #Covid_19 pic.twitter.com/6lzFtjXVcx \u2014 Amara Possian (@amarapossian) March 13, 2020\n\nWhen HuffPost Canada spoke to Possian on Monday, she had only heard from a few people who needed help. But dozens of others contacted her to say they were inspired by her act of kindness, and wanted to follow suit: other Toronto residents who wanted to implement a similar structure in their apartment buildings, someone in Halifax who added their own local resources, a 14-year-old in Montreal who wrote a bilingual message with her dad\u2019s help, even former MuchMusic VJ Jennifer Hollett.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really beautiful to see how people are stepping up for each other,\u201d Possian said. \u201cWe need everybody to do whatever they can, whether it\u2019s something that feels small or it\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s hoping, though, that even as we recognize how important individual contributions are, politicians still step in to accomplish what people, even working together, can\u2019t do.\n\n\u201cMy housemates and I can make soup for our friends, we can deliver groceries for our neighbours,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t collectively provide things like paid sick leave for all workers, or job protections so people have work to come back to when this is all over.\u201d\n\nWatch: What to put in a coronavirus emergency kit. Story continues after video.\n\nShe\u2019s certainly feeling some degree of anxiety about coronavirus, she said, but thinking of ways to help helped stave off some of that anxiety. \u201cIt felt good to focus on what I can do,\u201d she said.\n\nTarrabin, who grew up in Lebanon, said what\u2019s going on doesn\u2019t feel particularly dire for him because this isn\u2019t his first time in an emergency situation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different culture, how we handle the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know about emergencies, we know how to treat emergency cases.\u201d And he knows that older people and people who are already sick are more at risk, so it was easy to focus on helping them, he said.\n\nThere are now \u201ccaremongering\u201d groups on Facebook throughout Ontario, in Toronto, Hamilton, Kitchener-Waterloo, Niagara, Guelph and Ottawa, among others. There\u2019s one in Halifax, as well. Groups continue to pop up all over the country (there\u2019s an ongoing database here). It\u2019s worth searching social media for \u201ccoronavirus\u201d or \u201cCOVID-19\u201d and the name of your community. There are also resources for \u201cpod mapping,\u201d or helping communities, here and here.\n\nBoth Tarrabin and Possian have been surprised by the ripple effect their posts have caused, and they hope it keeps going.\n\n\u201cWhen people see other people panic, it leads to more panic,\u201d Possian said. \u201cI think the inverse is also true, that when we see people caring for other people, it also brings that out in us.\u201d"}}
