One issue in particular is integrity.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re in an interesting time with especially China, but other countries, and we want to make sure that we\u2019re operating openly with integrity while also protecting our assets,\u201d Droegemeier says. \u201cSo this is what JCORE is doing we\u2019re working very hard to put in place the best policies and practices so we all know what the rules of the road are so we can all follow the best practices which is what researchers want, but they have to know what the rules are to begin with.\u201d\n\nOther topics addressed by JCORE include:\n\nTransparency and openness in United States research while still protecting the work being done\n\nStreamlining paperwork across agencies to increase efficiency and reduce administrative burdens\n\nOpen the door for communication between agencies.\n\nDroegemeier sat own with officials of regional institutions, including the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, and says their questions for him mirror the goals of JCORE.\n\n\u201cA number of really great points were made,\u201d Droegemeier says, \u201cand top line concerns were how you deal with, say, somebody wanting to come here from another country to collaborate? What is allowed and what\u2019s not? If you\u2019re going to visit another country, who do you have to notify \u2014 what are the rules of the road, ultimately?\u201d\n\nYou can find our full interview with Droegemeier below."}}
