Some of the activities include arts and crafts, watching educational television shows and exercising.\n\n(Photo Courtesy Julie Cole)\n\nJennifer Kolari, a Toronto-based parenting expert and founder of Connected Parenting, said this type of structure will help prevent chaos in the house. Just because your children are home from school, doesn\u2019t mean they should be allowed to sleep for as long as they want or watch TV all day, she said.\n\n\u201cIf these days at home don\u2019t have structure or texture, your kids are going to get pyjama fever,\u201d Kolari previously told Global News.\n\n\u201cAs much as possible, you need to keep the structure looking very much like school.\u201d\n\nPlay games\n\nComing up with games is another way parents can keep their children entertained.\n\nBrittney Holton, a Hamilton mother of a one- and three-year-old, said she created a nature scavenger hunt for her kids in their backyard.\n\nHer kids then make crafts with their findings, work on motor skills, and draw maps of their neighbourhood to places like \u201cgrandma\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nFor parents who are working from home and taking care of their children, Kolari said they can do activities that are both fun and educational, like baking. Measuring out ingredients, for example, can teach kids how to follow instructions.\n\nBoth Conrad Pow and his wife are working from home while their two daughters are away from school. The Milton resident said his wife has been teaching their daughters how to bake a cake.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helping them enjoy the time off without overburdening them with everything that\u2019s going on,\u201d he said.\n\nParents can also have their children write letters to isolated seniors in long-term care homes to help them feel more connected. Engaging in positive activities is beneficial for mental and emotional well-being.\n\nWatch and read educational content\n\nSince students will not be attending classes for three weeks, some parents are trying to educate their children from home.\n\nPow said his daughters are using the Scholastic Learn at Home online resource to continue reading at home, and they play \u201cschool\u201d with their older daughter as the teacher and the younger one as the student.\n\nREAD MORE: How to talk to kids about the novel coronavirus without scaring them\n\n\u201cMy 10-year-old decided to make a little playbook for my five-year-old in order to get her entertained and learn at the same time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt kept my 10-year-old busy because she loves doing stuff like that and interacting with the five-year-old, who is trying to learn the basics of colours and writing simple words.\u201c\n\nQuestions about COVID-19? Here are some things you need to know:\n\nHealth officials say the risk is low for Canadians but warn this could change quickly. They caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are asked to self-isolate for 14 days in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others.\n\nSymptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing \u2014 very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities.\n\nTo prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. And if you get sick, stay at home.\n\nFor full COVID-19 coverage from Global News, click here.\n\n\u2014 With files from Global News\u2019 Meghan Collie\n\namanda.pope@globalnews.ca\n\n\u00a9 2020 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc."}}
