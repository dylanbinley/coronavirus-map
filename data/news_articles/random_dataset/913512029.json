Population Fund estimated that 18,000 teenage girls became pregnant during that outbreak, with long-term consequences. When schools re-opened the government banned them from attending, and many missed university entrance exams.\n\n\"The majority of the girls violated (in Sierra Leone) were violated in the context of the Ebola virus quarantine. People were told to stay home, and many girls were violated by their relatives and neighbours and people they knew,\" said Gitau.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Africa Education Coronavirus By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.
