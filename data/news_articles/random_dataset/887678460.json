Since then, Defense Secretary Mark Esper has said about 500 to 600 of 1,000 American forces will remain in Syria, some at a base in the south of the country and others in northern oil fields.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Holds Hearing On Firearms Accessory Regulation And Enforcing Background Checks\n\nGlenn Fine, acting Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Defense, testifies during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing concerning firearm accessory regulation and enforcing federal and state reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) on Capitol Hill, December 6, 2017 in Washington, DC.

Turkey views the Kurdish-led forces in Syria as terrorists.\n\nThe DIA report added that Islamic State is \u201cpostured to withstand\u201d the recent death of leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and probably will maintain \u201ccontinuity of operations, global cohesion, and at least its current trajectory.\u201d Absent U.S. \u201ccounterterrorism pressure, ISIS will likely have the \u2018time and space\u2019 to target the West and provide support to its global networks and branches,\u201d DIA said.\n\nSyrian and Russian forces that moved into northeastern Syria \u201care unlikely to prioritize fighting ISIS,\u201d the intelligence agency said. It said that the forces aligned with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad \u201chad not conducted operations against ISIS in the areas that they had moved into, and that these forces probably prioritize limiting Turkey\u2019s incursion into Syria over counterterrorism operations against ISIS.\u201d ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State.\n\nSenator Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said the report \u201cconfirms many of our worst fears.\u201d\n\nChuck Schumer\n\n@SenSchumer\n\nThis new assessment from @DefenseIntel confirms many of our worst fears:\n\nPres. Trump\u2019s precipitous withdrawal of troops from northern Syria gave ISIS a lifeline.\n\nAnd we still don\u2019t have a plan from him for how he will ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS.\n\nbloomberg.com/news/articles/\u2026\n\nSent via Twitter Web App.\n\nView original tweet.\n\nIn Iraq, U.S. commanders told the Pentagon inspector general that Islamic State continued last quarter \u201cto solidify and expand its command and control structures, although it had not increased its capabilities in areas where the Coalition was actively conducting operations against.\u201d\n\nCommanders also added that \u201cISIS combat power remains in restricted terrain and unpopulated areas where there is little to no local security presence.\u201d\n\n(Updates with Schumer\u2019s response in seventh paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story:\n\nTony Capaccio in Washington at [email protected]\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story:\n\nBill Faries at [email protected]\n\nLarry Liebert\n\nBloomberg Follow Save More"}}
