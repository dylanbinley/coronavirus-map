Corbett took more than 250 days to complete an audit that Murphy had promised within 100 days. A year later, trains are still late and overcrowded, if they even run at all. \u201cMurphy and Corbett continue to fail riders,\u201d Munoz said. \u201cWe are the second-busiest commuter rail network in the nation, and have gotten worse at providing service.\u201d\n\nAccording to Munoz, the NJ Transit board of directors hired Corbett to head the agency on Feb. 19, 2018, just 20 days after Murphy nominated him. He makes $280,000 a year, nearly $20,000 more than his predecessor did.\n\n\u201cGiven Assemblywoman Munoz\u2019s track record of complete and utter failure to hold Governor Christie accountable as he gutted and decimated NJ TRANSIT for eight years,\u201d Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s spokesman told NJBIZ. \u201cIt is not surprising to see her turn to disingenuous personal attacks to deflect attention from her lack of substantive solutions. Governor Murphy and NJ TRANSIT CEO Kevin Corbett are fully committed to turning around NJ TRANSIT and ensuring New Jersey commuters have the safe, reliable mass transportation agency they deserve, an effort that is already well underway despite the petty politics on display here.\u201d"}}
