The procedure is not extremely dangerous, although it carries some risks. It the operation goes smoothly, given his age and general condition, there is a good chance he will survive,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cI can assure everyone that Queen Elizabeth Hospital will give the best medical care to this boy, and it is the most experienced hospital in handling this sort of trauma.\u201d\n\nIn a recorded video message posted on Facebook, police Senior Superintendent Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan said the force was \u201csaddened\u201d by his injury.\n\n\u201cAt about 4 pm, a large group of rioters attacked police officers near Tai Ho Road, and they continued with their attack after officers warned them to stop,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAs an officer felt his life was under serious threat, he fired a round at the assailant to save his own life and his colleagues\u2019 lives,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThe police force really did not want to see anyone being injured, so we feel very sad about this. We warn rioters to stop breaking the law immediately, as we will strictly enforce the law.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab condemned the use of live ammo by police in Hong Kong, calling it a \u201cdisproportionate\u201d response that \u201conly risks inflaming the situation.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Raab called for restraint by both police and protesters, and said \u201cconstructive dialogue\u201d was needed to address the \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d of people in the former British territory, according to the BBC."}}
