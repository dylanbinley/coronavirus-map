Bush said, \u201cI looked [Vladimir Putin] in the eye. I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy\u2026I was able to get a sense of his soul.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Hillary Clinton responded by saying, \u201cHe was a KGB agent \u2014 by definition he doesn\u2019t have a soul.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, the Obama administration launched a \u201creset\u201d in the U.S. relationship with Russia.\n\nIn 2012, Mitt Romney said that \u201c[Russia] is without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Barack Obama responded by saying \u201cThe 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War\u2019s been over for 20 years.\u201d\n\nIn the years since Russia attempted to interfere in the 2016 election to damage Clinton and support Trump, those statements have caused confusion because not many Americans are well-versed in the events that transpired in Russia over those years.\n\nThe election of Vladimir Putin as Russia\u2019s president in 2000 came on the heels of a massive privatization of state-owned assets that began in the 1990s and created a group of wealthy oligarchs who basically ran the country. American capitalists, like Bush, applauded those efforts. To solidify his position, Putin made a grand bargain with the oligarchs in which he allowed them to maintain their power in exchange for support of his government. People like Hillary Clinton saw beyond the capitalist/communist framework and recognized that it was the authoritarianism that persisted, despite the changes.\n\nBy 2008, Putin had served two terms as Russia\u2019s president and was barred by the constitution from running again. So shortly before Obama\u2019s inauguration, Dmitry Medvedev was elected. That is what triggered the launch of the \u201creset.\u201d By 2010, the U.S. and Russia had signed a New START treaty that reduced nuclear arsenals and Russia had joined Obama\u2019s initiative to impose world-wide sanctions on Iran\u2014which eventually led to the Iran nuclear weapons agreement. There were other areas of cooperation, including U.S. efforts to secure Russia\u2019s membership in the World Trade Organization.\n\nPutin was planning to run for president once again in 2012 when his party, United Russia, barely retained control of the Duma in parliamentary elections in 2011 that independent monitoring groups described as fraudulent. In response, thousands of Russians took to the streets in protest. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton said, \u201cThe Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted. And that means they deserve fair, free, transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them.\u201d\n\nHere is how Michael McFaul, who was the U.S. ambassador to Russia at the time, described what happened next.\n\nPutin needed to defuse these popular protests and restore his standing in time for the March 2012 presidential election. Rather than engage with his opponents and attempt to co-opt them, he chose to repress and discredit his critics: He portrayed opposition leaders as traitorous agents of the United States\u2026 Even before the parliamentary vote, Putin began to develop the argument about American manipulation of Russia\u2019s internal politics. \u201cWe know that representatives of some countries meet with those whom they pay money \u2014 so-called grants \u2014 and give them instructions and guidance for the \u2018work\u2019 they need to do to influence the election campaign in our country,\u201d he said in November 2011. This was false, but American interference seemed very obvious to him: \u201cThey try to shake us up so that we don\u2019t forget who is boss on our planet.\u201d The popular demonstrations a month later appeared to confirm his suspicions. Putin was particularly upset when then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized the parliamentary vote. He claimed that she \u201cset the tone for several of our actors inside our country, she gave the signal. They heard that signal, and with the support of the State Department of the U.S., they began active work.\u201d\n\nAs expected, Putin was once again elected president in 2012 and adopted policies to stifle political dissent at home and increase pressure on the former Soviet republics, eventually invading Ukraine. McFaul got an up close and personal look at how Vladimir Putin operated.\n\nAs soon as I became the new proxy for Washington, Moscow launched a full-scale disinformation campaign alleging that, under my direction, the United States was funding the opposition and attempting to overthrow Putin. State propagandists and their surrogates crudely photoshopped me into pictures, spliced my speeches to make me say things I never uttered and even accused me of pedophilia.\n\nWhile that was happening, Putin launched an effort to court the groups in the U.S. who would go on to become Donald Trump\u2019s base of support and eventually, as Robert Mueller documented, launched a \u201csweeping and systematic\u201d campaign to damage Clinton and support Trump in the 2016 election. The president welcomed that interference and attempted to obstruct Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nTrump and his enablers want us to be misinformed about these events and are attempting to change the subject, claiming that the real threat we face is a coup attempt launched by those who saw what was happening and opened an investigation. For example, here is the Republican Minority Leader telling four lies in under 30 words.\n\nThe FBI broke into President Trump\u2019s campaign, spied on him, then tried to cover it up. This is a modern-day Watergate. pic.twitter.com/7YfyARPIlr \u2014 Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) December 22, 2019\n\n\n\nYou will find no better example of the fact that the modern-day Republican Party poses a threat to our democracy. Not only does McCarthy seem unconcerned with the fact that the FBI was tracking an attempt by a foreign adversary to influence our election, he referred to their investigation as a \u201ccoup attempt.\u201d He couldn\u2019t have chosen more inflammatory words.\n\nAs the conversation has shifted to the president\u2019s abuse of power with respect to Ukraine, it is important to keep this recent history in mind because Republicans are trying to re-write it with lies. Speaker Pelosi was absolutely right when she pointed out that, with Trump, all roads lead to Putin."}}
