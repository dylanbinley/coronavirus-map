I have bad asthma and a preexisting condition,\u201d Rahel Geberkidan, a seven-year tenant, said in a statement. \u201cI don\u2019t let anyone around me. Mosser says, \u2018We are here to help you,\u2019 but bringing strangers into my home does not help. It\u2019s threatening and terrifying. It\u2019s just greed \u2014 they don\u2019t care about my well-being, they just want to make more money.\u201d\n\nA band with drums and trumpets led the protesters in chants, \u201cHousing is a human right,\u201d and \u201cMosser, Mosser, rich and rude, we don\u2019t like your attitude.\u201d\n\nMosser said Thursday afternoon it would stop inspections for the remainder of the week. The firm added that previous inspections complied with safety rules such as wearing protective equipment and occurred with the consent of residents.\n\n\u201cBuilding and apartment inspections are necessary to maintain properties, comply with local laws, and for insurance purposes,\u201d the company said. \u201cIn response to the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis, we proactively reached out to all our elderly residents to offer to help with any of their daily activities. We are continuing to work with (affected) residents and properties on rent deferrals and other considerations while ensuring that enhanced cleaning protocols are in place at each property.\u201d\n\nA notice to tenants stated that Mosser and investors would enter each residence between 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. The inspections would include a \u201cvery quick look in each unit and more thorough look thru common areas.\u201d The notice said all visitors would have full personal protective gear and the inspections would take only a few minutes. Sabeena Shah, a resident, provided the notice to The Chronicle.\n\nMosser cited a California law that authorizes landlords to enter apartments to exhibit them to potential purchasers and other personnel.\n\nBut tenants believe that the inspections violate Alameda County health orders, which mandate real estate showings to be held online whenever possible. If that isn\u2019t possible, a single photographer and videographer is permitted to visit once when residents aren\u2019t present. If the second option isn\u2019t possible, in-person showings can only occur if residents are not at home, with visitors limited to two people from one household at a time.\n\n\u201cThe law\u2019s constantly in flux right now,\u201d said Jacqueline Ravenscroft, a partner at Tobener Ravenscroft, a law firm that represents tenants. \u201cGenerally, the rule is real estate agents or other landlords showing the property shouldn\u2019t be showing it in person.\u201d\n\nRavenscroft said that if a landlord insisted on showing a property, a tenant could refuse entry, but the landlord could respond with a three-day notice to \u201cquit or cure,\u201d with the tenant deciding to either allow entry or terminate their lease. The dispute could potentially then go to court. Such cases could previously be heard in court within 60 days before the pandemic, but with cases currently limited to online hearings and a major backlog, there will be months before new cases are heard, she said.\n\nTobener Ravenscroft has previously represented Mosser tenants but is not involved in the current Oakland dispute, she said.\n\nShah, a resident since 2012, said tenants requested information on whether the investors would be tested for the coronavirus, but hadn\u2019t received a response as of Thursday morning.\n\nMosser, a major owner of San Francisco apartments, bought multiple Oakland buildings starting in 2016, including the 34-unit 444 28th St. for $7.6 million in November 2017, property records show. Federal records show Mosser Companies received a Paycheck Protection Program loan between $2 million and $5 million to help it keep staff employed during the pandemic.\n\nTenants also allege that Mosser has previously inspected apartments without first notifying residents and excessively inspected apartments, which Shah described as harassment. Shah also alleged that the landlord has been unwilling to do repairs, such as taking two weeks to clean broken glass in the laundry room, and not adequately cleaning recurring cases of black mold.\n\n\u201cThe management company has a dedicated operations team that addresses work orders within one to three days,\u201d Mosser said.\n\nShah, who teaches at Mount Diablo Unified School District, pays around $1,300 a month for a studio. She has been on rent strike since April, along with tenants at other Mosser buildings in Oakland. She said losing her apartment would mean she would have to leave the Bay Area. Remodeled studios and one-bedroom apartments in the same building are now $2,195 to $2,295 per month, according to Mosser\u2019s website.\n\nMike Nemeth, director of communications at the California Apartment Association, a state landlord group, said he wasn\u2019t aware of many cases of investor tours. The group is advising landlords and brokers to use virtual tours or, if that isn\u2019t possible, to use masks and physical distancing.\n\n\u201cIt seems we\u2019re all doing more things remotely these days, and virtual tours, where practical, can offer a good solution,\u201d he said.\n\nRoland Li is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
