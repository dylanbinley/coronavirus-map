The theme of the music and dinner was showcasing the Victorian era. Guests were served dinner by the performers, and they ate while the choir rotated performances around the room. The dinner acted as a fundraiser to raise money for the choir\u2019s upcoming tour to Austria and the Czech Republic.\n\n\u201cThis event is a lot of work,\u201d said Susan Marchant, director of the PSU choirs and chair of the music department. \u201cI just can\u2019t thank the students enough. They get all this music prepared in just a few months, and many of them are freshmen, and we\u2019re still learning how to work together as a group. It\u2019s inspirational to see how they can so quickly learn to function together, and that has benefits for the rest of the year.\u201d\n\nMarchant accompanied many of the performances at the piano while the students sang.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going in a circle around the room so everyone gets a chance to hear different songs,\u201d Hannah Casper said, freshman in communication. \u201cIt is a fun theme, all of the songs are very upbeat and happy, which is very refreshing,\u201d Casper said.\n\nThe theme of this year\u2019s performance was \u201cVictoriana\u201d, because this year is the bicentennial year of queen Victoria of England\u2019s birth.\n\n\u201cThis one was pretty great, I think a lot of people related to the Victorian era,\u201d said Mikaela Crotchett, senior in music education. \u201cSome people in the room actually grew up hearing those types of songs and those pieces, so a lot of them were singing along, and really got into it, which always helps.\u201d\n\nEvery two years, the choir goes on an international trip. This year, they are going to Austria and the Czech Republic.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve discovered over the years is that, there will be somebody in that group who has never been on an airplane, many of them who has never been out of the country, and some who has never been out of the state,\u201d Marchant said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a really nice side benefit of the touring, is to give that experience to people who might not otherwise have any options for doing that,\u201d\n\nThe choir dinner was part of one of the fundraisers to raise money for the trip.\n\n\u201cFrom a musical standpoint, touring is wonderful because we get to sing in historic places, and you get very little time to figure out how to perform everything in that space, so what the group learns from that is amazing, because we bring that experience with us to everything that we do here,\u201d Marchant said.\n\nThe performance included a variety of songs, sung by both groups and soloists.\n\n\u201cI love performing,\u201d Crotchett said. \u201cI don\u2019t get to do it as often as I (would like), so when I get to perform it makes me feel really good. I perform in both choir settings and small ensemble setting, and today I actually sang a solo so that was kind of a big deal.\u201d\n\nCrotchett was one of several students in the choirs that performed a solo.\n\n\u201cI was nervous at first, but it was really exciting to get to do, and show off how hard I\u2019ve been working, and how far I\u2019ve come in my years,\u201d Crotchett said.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n"}}
