That is my goal,\" Mendenhall said. \"If that can't come to fruition then Salt Lake City can take action alone as a city, but it is so much more impactful if we can act together.\"\n\nSo far, Summit County is the only region in Utah to mandate staying at home. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert has said he prefers not to see such measures instituted on a statewide level, but nothing is off the table as far as statewide restrictions.\n\nLike many, I'm eager to issue a stay at home order. But as a capital city surrounded by & relied upon by others throughout Utah, our efforts are only as good as the efforts of those around us. Moving ahead with the state will be more effective. If we can't, I'm ready to act soon pic.twitter.com/vFVlpwtdgP \u2014 SLC Mayor Erin Mendenhall (@slcmayor) March 26, 2020\n\nSalt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson also said a stay-at-home order is \"likely necessary,\" but she will work with state leaders to coordinate such a mandate.\n\n\"We are fortunate that Utah is a couple weeks behind much of the nation, so we can use what is happening in other areas to inform our decision making,\" Wilson said in a Thursday statement. \"I believe a stay-at-home order is likely necessary to avoid overburdening our hospitals as early as April, but a decision like that is best done in coordination with the State of Utah, our neighboring counties, and our municipalities.\"\n\nWilson said she had a meeting Thursday with hospital representatives and state leaders to discuss information in order to make an informed decision."}}
