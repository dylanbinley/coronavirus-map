Some are then choosing to top up the amount for the employee.\n\nMr Eustice today said these workers could be asked to consider a second job in June.\n\n\"We're also acutely aware that we're about to start the British season in fresh produce, in soft fruits and salads,\" Mr Eustice told the briefing.\n\n\"We estimate that probably only about a third of the migrant labour that would normally come to the UK is here, and was probably here before lockdown.\n\n\"We are working with industry to identify an approach that will encourage those millions of furloughed workers in some cases to consider taking a second job, helping get the harvest in June.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's not an issue at the moment since the harvest has barely begun, but we do anticipate that there will be a need to recruit staff for those sectors in the month of June.\"\n\nDrop a heart on our special map of gratitude to show your support for our NHS heroes https://www.thanksamillionnhs.co.uk/"}}
