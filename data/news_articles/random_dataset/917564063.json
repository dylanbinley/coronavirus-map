After, 1 in 3 new trials involve hydroxychloroquine.\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric around the drug is likely behind the surge, some of the nation\u2019s leading infectious disease experts told the USA TODAY Network. And while they agree that the new wave of trials should help definitely resolve whether the drug is indeed effective against COVID-19, they cautioned that results in most studies are still months away.\n\nBut damage from hydroxychloroquine\u2019s swift and widespread adoption may already be happening, the experts said.\n\nMany doctors have been prescribing hydroxychloroquine to coronavirus patients, despite no conclusive evidence of its success. This is exposing patients already suffering from cardiac ailments due to COVID-19 to a drug with cardiac toxicity, whose known side effects include cardiac arrhythmia and arrest, said Dr. Andre Kalil, Director of Transplant Infectious Diseases at the University of Nebraska.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do randomized controlled trials, if we just give these drugs to people just because they are sick, a lot of people may end up being killed by this drug because of the side effects,\u201d Kalil said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll never know it because we\u2019ll think they died from COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThe drug, which has been used to treat malaria since the 1940s and is approved by FDA, has shown an ability to fight viruses \u2014 including HIVE, dengue, yellow fever and influenza \u2014 in vitro, Kalil said. That is, it has demonstrated antiviral properties in test tubes and petri dishes.\n\nBut a cell culture in a plate cannot represent the human body, Kalil said. In fact, chloroquine drugs have consistently failed to combat each one of these viral diseases in human patients for the last century, he said. That it has shown success in vitro alone \u201ccannot be a reason to give drugs to human beings.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are safety issues,\u201d Kalil said. \u201cThere is no scientific reasoning to giving unsafe drugs to patients other than panic. This is panic.\u201d\n\nKatherine Seley-Radtke of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who has specialized in antiviral drugs for three decades, expressed concerns that the new wave of clinical trials are placing hydroxychloroquine as too high a priority.\n\n\u201cWhat concerns me and what concerns a lot of people is the fact that there are a number of other drugs that show potential that should be being looked at,\u201d Seley-Radtke said.\n\nRemdesivir, favipiravir and galidesivir are three examples of antiviral drugs that have shown early promise against the coronavirus, she said. It is far more intuitive that one of these drugs would wind up being a cure than an antimalarial, she said, which is more of a treatment that helps prevent the immune system from overworking itself.\n\nBut these drugs are being tested in only a dozen of the 183 coronavirus drug trials on the NIH registry. By comparison, four dozen of these trials involve hydroxychloroquine.\n\n\u201cIf we've put all of our eggs into this one basket,\u201d she said, \u201cand then in three weeks or five weeks or six weeks or however long until we come out of this, it's shown that this indeed doesn't cure COVID, and nothing else is being done, we're now behind the eight ball again.\u201d\n\nFrench study denounced\n\nThe president has repeatedly touted hydroxychloroquine as a potential solution to the coronavirus and encouraged its use in treatment.\n\n\u201cI hope they use the hydroxychloroquine,\u201d Trump said at a press briefing on April 4. \u201cI hope they use it because I'll tell you what, what do you have to lose?\u201d\n\nMuch of the Trump administration\u2019s enthusiasm around the drug appears based on positive results from a study in China and one in France that showed some clinical benefit treating COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin. But experts have roundly criticized these studies due to their small size and lack of well-defined control groups.\n\nIn fact, the society that publishes the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, in which the French study appeared on March 20, denounced the study on April 3, saying it \u201cdoes not meet the Society\u2019s expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, two subsequent studies conducted in China and France showed nearly opposite results. The French study used hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to treat 11 patients with severe COVID-19 infections and found \u201cno evidence of rapid antiviral clearance or clinical benefit.\u201d One patient died, two were transferred to intensive care units and one was pulled from the study due to serious complications.\n\nDr. David Boulware of the University of Minnesota Medical School\u2019s Division of Infectious Diseases and International Medicine is currently running three clinical trials into the drug\u2019s effect on COVID-19.\n\nThe first, which launched March 17 and claims to be the first clinical hydroxychloroquine trial into COVID-19 in the U.S., examines prophylactic effects of hydroxychloroquine in exposed patients without symptoms. The second studies the drug\u2019s treatment effects in symptomatic patients, and the third studies prophylaxis in high-risk healthcare workers.\n\nThe studies exclude patients with heart conditions, Boulware said, and his first interim analysis identified no safety or efficacy concerns that prevent it from continuing.\n\n\u201cThere is no data that (hydroxychloroquine) actually has any clinical benefit,\u201d Boulware said. \u201cClinical trials are needed.\u201d\n\nThat hydroxychloroquine is readily available may help explain the recent surge in clinical trials, Boulware said, noting that any doctor can prescribe it to any patient for any reason because it is FDA approved.\n\nBoulware said he is less concerned about an abundance of hydroxychloroquine trials than he is about reduced participation in trials. It\u2019s possible, he said, that people will opt not to participate in well-designed, randomized trials because they can get hydroxychloroquine outside of a trial instead \u2014 and not face a 50% chance of receiving a placebo.\n\n\u201cThat does not move our knowledge of how best to treat patients forward,\u201d Boulware said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how hydroxychloroquine works.\u201d\n\nBoulware declined to share if his trials have been impacted as a result but said the first is on pace to finish enrollment by the end of April.\n\nInitially, patient interventions and exams for that trial had been slated for completion by April 21, according to the National Institute of Health data.\n\nAdditionally, the university website shows just over 1,000 people have enrolled in the trials so far \u2014 well short of its combined goal of 6,500.\n\n\u201cPretty good,\u201d he said, \u201cbut more volunteers from around the country would make recruitment go faster (and) get results sooner.\""}}
