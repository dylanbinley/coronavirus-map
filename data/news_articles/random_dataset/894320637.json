She received support from Victoria College's Dean's Experience Enhancement Fund and a small grant from the School of the Environment.\n\n\u201cWhat I have learned is that international decision-making can be very, very slow,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a disconnect between what the people want and how much decision-makers are willing to give,\u201d she added.\n\nThe students and other Canadians were able to sit in on weekly briefings with Canadian delegates, Patel says, giving them an inside look at Canada\u2019s role at the conference. The delegation included provincial representatives, Indigenous Peoples, environmental groups, labour groups and others.\n\n\u201cIt was interesting to see some of the feedback that people had brought up to the Canadian delegates, which the delegates later brought to the discussions,\u201d Patel says.\n\nThe students were able to obtain accreditation for COP25 thanks to Matthew Hoffman, a professor of political science at U of T Scarborough whose research focuses on environmental governance. Hoffman is the co-author of a recent paper calling for an emphasis on decarbonization \u2013 cutting out fossil fuels and focusing on renewable energy \u2013 instead of simply reducing emissions.\n\n\u201cIt is always valuable to be able to connect what students are learning in the classroom with lived experience,\u201d Hoffman says. \u201cYou get a different perspective hearing activists make their case directly, seeing the separation between the country delegations and negotiations and the civil society activities.\n\n\u201cI hope they understand the enormity of the global process, why it's slow and why civil society is (rightly) frustrated with how slow it is.\u201d\n\nRutu Patel, Emily Stutzman and Naomi Butterfield in Madrid (photo courtesy of Grace Ma)\n\nWhile Thunberg has become an icon of the climate movement, Micaela Tam, an international relations and history major, says her attendance at briefings by Climate Action Network Canada introduced her to the many people \u2013 Indigenous groups, youth, civil society organizations \u2013 also agitating for change.\n\nThe outcome of the climate talks was widely said to be disappointing, producing few new targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. After more than two weeks, negotiators weren\u2019t able to persuade the largest polluters to amp up their efforts to address climate change as of 2020.\n\n\u201cOne major impression was the disconnect between the talk of urgency and the reality of delay,\u201d Hoffman told U of T News. \u201cThe frustration felt by civil society and a number of states with the inability of the international community to commit to higher ambition was palpable. I think this disappointing result will actually make the youth movement push even harder for action.\u201d\n\nBut the U of T students say a march held the same week in Madrid, where Thunberg took the stage, gave them at least some hope about the planet\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cAttending the march and hearing Greta speak was more inspiring than attending COP25,\u201d says Emily Stutzman, a third-year student double majoring in environmental studies and political science.\n\n\u201cMore change will come from the people, and especially young activists outside of COP25 than from the leaders and negotiators within.\u201d\n\nNaomi Butterfield, a University College student who\u2019s majoring in international relations and forestry conservation science, says a hush fell over the audience when the 16-year-old Swedish activist took the mic.\n\nButterfield says Thunberg\u2019s voice broke as she spoke, emphasizing the urgency of the climate crisis and criticizing the lack of progress at COP25.\n\n\u201cThe hope is not within the walls of the COP25,\u201d Thunberg told the crowd. \u201cThe hope is out here with you.\u201d\n\nPatel also has confidence in her generation. \u201cI think the role of youth is going to be very prominent because we\u2019re going to bring \u2013 and we are bringing \u2013 this energy and this push for change,\u201d she says."}}
