That's why I ran away in Zimbabwe - my life was in danger.\"\n\nShe said while she is extremely grateful for the accommodation, she was given no information about what to do when she arrived here.\n\n\"You don't have a place to go and you don't know anybody. I wake up early in the morning, I go for breakfast, I go back in the room, I sleep and go for lunch and dinner.\n\n\"I feel like I don't have a life, I am a person that is supposed to eat and sleep, eat and sleep, I don't know exactly what to do in life - I feel like I'm trapped.\"\n\nIt costs an estimated \u20ac100 per night per person to place a person in a hotel, while the average rate for direct provision is \u20ac40.\n\nCEO of the Irish Refugee Council Nick Henderson says there are a number of problems connected to accommodating vulnerable people in commercial hotels.\n\n\"People who we have worked with through our services have difficulty engaging in support services.\n\n\"The hotels are often staffed by people who are used to looking after tourists and not people who are fleeing persecution.\n\n\"We have also had reports and have worked with people who have been in B&Bs and the staff of those B&Bs have been quite controlling and have been quite strict and inappropriate rules apply.\"\n\nThe Department says 284 people have been transferred from emergency accommodation to direct provision centres in the past year.\n\nRead more:\n\nTender for Oughterard direct provision centre withdrawn\n\nNumbers in direct provision above Govt's contracted capacity\n\nMeanwhile, there are just over 6,000 people in its 38 direct provision centres across the country.\n\nThe Department of Justice says expenditure on accommodation for international protection applicants is expected to reach \u20ac120m this year compared with \u20ac78m last year.\n\nThe department said expenditure is impacted by increased demand for accommodation and a rise in the number of asylum-seekers coming to Ireland.\n\nIt said the use of emergency accommodation is also putting additional pressure on costs this year.\n\nThe Government was dealt a blow yesterday when the tender for a direct provision centre in Oughterard in Galway was withdrawn following protests in the area.\n\nIn a statement the Department of Justice said the development would exacerbate \"a very serious shortage\" of accommodation for people seeking international protection in Ireland.\n\nIt also said acknowledged that the direct provision system is not perfect but it did say it was working to improve it.\n\nIn the D\u00e1il yesterday Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said direct provision was far from ideal but he said the alternative was camps and containers.\n\nHe said: \"We will never be in a position nor will any country be in a position to provide housing or an apartment to everyone who comes into the country as an asylum seeker that is just not possible and no country does that.\n\n\"The sad reality is that the alternative to direct provision is what happens in France and Germany and Greece and Italy which is camps and containers, and I hope that we never get to that point here in Ireland.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice said a tendering process is ongoing to find new accommodation centres for people seeking asylum in Ireland.\n\nIt also said the Reception and Integration Agency is committed to using emergency accommodation for as short a time as possible."}}
