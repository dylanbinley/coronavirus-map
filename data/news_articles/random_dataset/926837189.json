But she was undeterred.\n\n\"When we see people looting,\" she told Fox 11, \"it defeats the cause.\"\n\nThe man -- whose sign read \"We Protect! NOT LOOT\" -- said one of the looters threatened to pull a gun on him.\n\n\"I told him, 'I carry. You need to back off,'\" he told the station. \"Once he saw the phone and saw I was recording, he left.\"\n\nOne business owner was reportedly hospitalized after being assaulted by looters while trying to defend his store at 7th and Broadway.\n\nAsked on the Today Show \"why protesters faced a larger presence than the looters,\" Renaud said police had \"quite a crowd to work with and control.\"\n\n\"Police officers were taking bottles and having things thrown at them,\" the Police Chief said. \"There was definitely violence, along with cars coming into the City intent on looting.\"\n\nMayor Pro Tem Terry O'Day was on the street watching the looting taking place when it became clear the strikes were being organized.\n\nThe looters, he said, were breaking in then calling cars that came to pick up the stolen merchandise, before emptying the cars and returning for another round of goods.\n\n\"It was clear there was a lot of communication among the criminal element,\" O'Day said.\n\nCity officials, he said, were \"making real life decisions to protect and (keep) safety first\" and will evaluate the response once the crisis has passed.\n\n\"This was occurring across the entire county and across the nation,\" O'Day said. \"We were making decisions on the ground affecting an entire city.\n\n\"We will have more information about how this situation was handled.\"\n\n\n\nMayor Kevin McKeown -- who called Sunday \"one of the most distressing days in Santa Monica history\" -- blamed \"opportunistic and organized criminals\" for betraying the peaceful protest.\n\n\n\n\"I\u2019m grateful that we did not lose any lives,\" McKeown said in a statement late Sunday night.\n\n\"Our public safety officers showed professional restraint and resolve under the most difficult of circumstances,\" he said.\n\n"}}
