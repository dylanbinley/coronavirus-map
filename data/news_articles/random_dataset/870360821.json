Picture Martin McKeown. 04.09.19\n\nA house in Londonderry has been extensively damaged after a van was driven into it several times before the vehicle was set on fire by masked men.\n\nThe white Ford Transit van was driven at the house on Glendale Road at around 8.20pm on Tuesday.\n\nThe van was then set ablaze on the street and masked men smashed windows at the property before fleeing in two other cars- a red Ford Mondeo and a green Toyota Avensis.\n\nNo one was in the house at the time and there was no reported injuries.\n\nPolice attended along with the Fire Service who extinguished the van.\n\nDetective Inspector Jack said officers were aware of a report that a shot may have been fired, however police are still working to establish what occurred and the motive for what was described as a \"completely reckless attack\".\n\n\u201cI want to make a number of appeals this morning, in particular about the movements of the white Ford Transit van, a red Ford Mondeo and a green Toyota Avensis,\" Detective Inspector Jack said.\n\nExpand Close Masked men fleeing the scene of the incident. / Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsapp Masked men fleeing the scene of the incident.\n\n\"Did you seen any of these vehicles prior to what occurred last night?
