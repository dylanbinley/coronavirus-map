In response to WCSU students and alumni asking for a replacement of our current mascot, the student government association, the student group Speak Truth to Power, and the university will begin a student-driven process to find a new mascot that better reflects today\u2019s Western Connecticut State University\u2014 a university where racism and hatred have no home. Sincerely Dr. John B. Clark, President.\u201d\n\nAs of Monday, the post on Facebook had over 450 comments on both sides of the issue.\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of organizing a committee that will look at the mascot and decide whether and how to change from Chuck,\u201d Paul Steinmetz , the school\u2019s director of university and community relations, said. \u201cIt will be a student-led process, with the Student Government Association and a student organization called Speak Truth to Power in the forefront. The university will provide resources and what support they may need.\u201d\n\nComments promoting change state it is historically representative of ethnic violence, genocide and racism.\n\nThose who wish to keep the nickname state it is an embodiment of the founding of the United States and American resilience.\n\nA petition on Change.org had 315 signatures on a petition to change the name to Whales.\n\n\u201cMost students who I\u2019ve spoken to want to change it either because they think it\u2019s a weird, boring mascot that is less interesting than other universities, or because it represents a violent era in American history that students feel does not reflect our community, or both,\u201d Audrey Nielsen, editor of the student-run Echo Newspaper, said via email.\n\nThe SGA is planning a WebX meeting on Thursday, June 18 at 1 p.m. to discuss the changing of the name.\n\nThis is not the first time the school has considered changing its nickname. In 1974, the school changed its nickname from Indians.\n\nWestern Connecticut is not alone in looking for a change from Colonials.\n\nIn 2018, George Washington University students began a campaign to change their school\u2019s mascot as well.\n\nThat change is still being debated, though the University changed the name of its Student Service Hub and Student Financial and Registration Services to remove reference to its nickname."}}
