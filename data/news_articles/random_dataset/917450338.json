Under the category of solid waste management, sewerage and janitorial services \u2014- live-in domestic workers have been included.\n\nWhere the Ministry had previously listed factories, manufacturers or distributors of food supplies and essential goods including medical supplies, it noted that this category also includes producers of rice, sugar, poultry and fish.\n\nThere was a minor change made to the restriction on social activities to make an exception for visitation to a creek, beach or river only if the person is residing or working there.\n\nAlong with the previous services which were permitted to remain open daily from 06:00 hours to 17:00 hours, the category of banks has been updated to include other financial institutions defined in the Financial Institution Act, Chapter 85:03 as well as remittance services and their support services.\n\nIncluded too are bulk food stores; funeral homes; operation, inspection, repair and maintenance of essential services including vehicles, vessels and aircraft and traffic signal maintenance; automotive repair and maintenance facilities that provide direct support to essential businesses and services necessary for the maintenance of residences, including plumbing, electrical and extermination services.\n\nThe measures now state that where a Village Council, as defined by the Amerindian Act \u2014- Cap. 29:01 \u2014 has determined that a public health threat exists in relation to any mining or forestry operation conducted in accordance with the highlighted essential services, the Village Council shall recommend to the Minister of Public Health that the operation be discontinued.\n\nIn addition to previous guidelines, any services deemed as essential or any public service, statutory bodies and state-owned enterprises, must require persons to wear a face mask when inside of the establishment.\n\nThe need for distance markers has not been made mandatory but all staff are to maintain physical distance of at least six feet in or outside their establishment and determine the number of persons that may be permitted into the building based on the need for distancing.\n\nWhen it comes to domestic travel, the Kurupukari Crossing shall be closed except during the period 06:00 hours to 17:00 hours, and only to facilitate the passage of essential services and supplies. This is in addition to the four other stipulations under domestic travel.\n\nThe imposed curfew between 18:00 hours and 06:00 hours and all other aforementioned measures remains in effect.\n\nAny person who fails to comply with any of these measures commits an offence under section 152 of the Public Health Ordinance and is liable on summary conviction to the penalty provided under that section.\n\nThe Prime Minister has stated in the past that he believes that the measures in place whereby persons in non-essential areas are required to stay at home will result in health security and safety for Guyanese.\n\nHe has stated that the order is not meant to \u201clockdown\u201d the productive sectors but is aimed at protecting the local population while containing the spread of the virus."}}
