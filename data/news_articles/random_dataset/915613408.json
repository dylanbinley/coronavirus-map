He traveled back to Hoima where he started undertaking personal businesses.\n\nThe Hoima district coronavirus response task force located him and isolated him at Hoima regional referral hospital and called the Ministry of Health which transferred him back to Mulago for further management.\n\nThe Kyabigambire Sub County councillor, Mr Swaib Nyangabyaki, told journalists on Monday that since he reported about the presence of suspected cases in his sub county, the district health team had failed to respond to his concerns.\n\n\u201cWe have five suspects who need attention. The suspects are on tension, people want to riot over them. Top district leaders, please help these innocent people,\u201d Nyangabyaki said.\n\nHe said a woman in Kyamongi LCI who returned from Kenya to visit her sister is now being chased away on suspicion of being a COVID-19 patient.\n\n\u201cThis very lady is a total orphan she lost all her parents she has nowhere to go. I personally can't help this young innocent lady, I am feeling the pain myself. I can't refuse picking calls. I\u2019m overwhelmed. Anybody who can help and raise my voice to the Ministry of Health or state house, please help,\u201d Mr Nyangabyaki said.\n\nMr Samuel Kisembo Araali, the Hoima Resident District Commissioner who is chairing the district coronavirus response taskforce said his office responded to the concerns of the residents.\n\n\u201cAs we talk now, our two teams are in Buraru parish and Kyabigambire. Residents can contact the district surveillance officer, Mr Fred Kugonza who is heading the two teams. We should also appreciate that Ministry of Health issued guidelines on whose samples should be taken. One must fit in the case definition to be tested,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Monday, the taskforce obtained two samples from suspects and the task force returned to the area on Tuesday morning to collect more samples.\n\nKisembo said there are currently three teams that are moving in the district.\n\nHe added that the calls for testing are overwhelming but the district has asked the health ministry to beef up the task force with at least more two teams to meet the increasing demand to test and track suspects.\n\n\u201cWe continue to thank the leaders and community for the vigilance and support,\u201d Kisembo added."}}
