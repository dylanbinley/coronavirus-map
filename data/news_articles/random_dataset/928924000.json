The governor of North Carolina, the official host of this summer\u2019s Republican National Convention, had refused to promise Trump a full-blown convention in Charlotte free from social distancing measures during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to celebrate this momentous occasion in the great city of Jacksonville,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cNot only does Florida hold a special place in President Trump\u2019s heart as his home state, but it is crucial in the path to victory in 2020. We look forward to bringing this great celebration and economic boon to the Sunshine State in just a few short months.\u201d\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nMcDaniel said the event would be held at the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena, which holds 15,000 people. She said more details would be released in the coming weeks.\n\nThe party\u2019s more mundane business, including discussions over the platform, will still be held in Charlotte because of contractual obligations.\n\nThe RNC had spent the last week scouting locations after North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper rejected Trump\u2019s demand that the convention be allowed to take place Aug. 24-27 without social distancing measures.\n\nThe Jacksonville area is one of the state\u2019s most populous, with 1.5 million residents, but it doesn\u2019t have the glitz of Miami or the worldwide familiarity of Orlando. The community has tilted from the solidly conservative bastion it once was to the more politically diverse place it now is. While the area\u2019s population is still mostly white, 21% of its 1.5 million residents are black and 9% are Latino, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\n\u201cFlorida is honored to host this special event where we will celebrate the re-nomination of President Donald J. Trump,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cJacksonville is a great city that will showcase Florida\u2019s energy, facilities, entrepreneurship and commitment to bring together the delegates of the Republican Party at a historic time in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nJacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry, a former chair of the state Republican Party, tweeted a video announcing his city\u2019s selection for Trump\u2019s speech. He said Jacksonville would be prepared and ready.\n\n\u201cWhat city would take on the Republican National Convention with just 75 days to pull it off?\u201d he asked. \u201cProbably not many. But Jacksonville isn\u2019t just any city.\u201d\n\nIn a statement provided by the RNC, Curry also touted the \u201ctremendous economic impact\u201d from hosting the event. The celebration could generate at least $100 million in revenues for the host city, perhaps more.\n\nBut Ben Frazier, a black activist with the Northside Coalition of Jacksonville, said the event would be disruptive to the city during a time of racial tension and a pandemic.\n\n\u201cI only see this exacerbating these problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s concerned about the money the city could make. We\u2019re concerned about the lives of people here in Jacksonville more than anything else. We don\u2019t simply need to be concerned about dollars and cents.\u201d\n\nTerrie Rizzo, the chair of the state\u2019s Democratic Party, expressed concern about the gathering.\n\n\u201cI am deeply concerned that the impetus for moving their highest profile event to Florida was because Donald Trump wanted to give a speech to a crowd of people not social distancing \u2014 and, given his previous public events, likely not wearing masks,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTrump is coming to Florida to throw himself a big party \u2014 but it\u2019s looking more and more like a goodbye party to his chance at a second term in the White House,\u201d she said."}}
