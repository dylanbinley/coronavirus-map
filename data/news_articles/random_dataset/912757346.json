Britain and Ireland are not part of it, and neither is Gibraltar.\n\nTwo sources told Reuters that EU leaders were expected to discuss the matter during a video conference on Tuesday on the health crisis.\n\nOne EU official said the bloc's executive European Commission prepared a proposal to suspend for 30 days visits of non-EU and non-Schengen nationals. Exceptions would cover medical workers and other \"essential\" travel.\n\nA second EU official said: \"The idea is being discussed with a view to avoid putting the health services under even more strain. But it remains to be seen what EU leaders decide on Tuesday, whether non-EU Schengen countries join, whether we coordinate with Britain and Ireland too.\"\n\nIf the EU adopts measures at Schengen borders, that could potentially have an impact on the border between Gibraltar and Spain.\n\nFor now though, it was largely business at usual at the Gibraltar frontier, even though the state of emergency announced by Spain at the weekend restricted all but essential travel inside Spain and, by extension, had some knock-on implications those crossing the border.\n\nWhile those crossing the border for work reasons or to go to and from their homes have so far experienced few problems, those wishing to travel to Spain for leisure have been turned back.\n\nThe Gibraltar Government has repeatedly advised Gibraltar residents not to travel to Spain except for essential reasons and to familiarise themselves with the terms of the Spanish decree.\n\nYesterday the Gibraltar Government said it was satisfied that the measures announced on Monday did not apply to Gibraltar and were therefore \u201cnot in any way politically motivated\u201d against Gibraltar.\n\n\u201cI am satisfied that the measures being adopted are not applicable to our frontier and are not therefore politically motivated against us,\u201d Chief Minister Fabian Picardo said.\n\n\u201cThey are the application to Spain\u2019s existing internal Schengen frontiers of what is already applicable throughout the territory of Spain to all Spanish citizens already and at our frontier.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have had it confirmed that workers needing to come across the frontier will be able to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe advise them to have copies of their employment contracts with them if possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdditionally, we are also satisfied that there will be no effect on the supply of goods across the frontier for our supermarkets and grocers and, most importantly, for our health authority.\u201d\n\nBUSINESS AS USUAL\n\nThe Gibraltar frontier was flowing normally on Monday morning as cross-border workers returned to work after the Spanish state of emergency came into force.\n\nArmed with papers in hand showing that they worked in Gibraltar, one worker said: \u201cI\u2019ve had no problem entering, I needed the papers but they have only glanced at them.\u201d\n\nThere was fluidity in the flow at 7.30am as the bulk of workers entered. Vehicles rolled in with little hesitation at the border checks. With no restrictions in the Gibraltar side of the border there was only a momentary pause as they entered as the Spanish authorities glanced at the paperwork.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much as normal, if anything there is a little less volume because tourists are not coming in,\u201d an immigration officer at the border told this reporter.\n\nA police inspector checking the border indicated the same.\n\nConstruction workers, officer workers and other private sector workers converged through the border, with the occasional person wearing a mask.\n\n\u201cI have had no problem, but now let\u2019s see what happens when I return,\u201d said one Spanish National waiting for other workers to be picked up by the work vans.\n\nThere were some differences though for workers who usually travel to their place of work by bus.\n\n\u201cWe are usually packed at this time of the morning but it\u2019s only been three or four people at a time,\u201d a bus driver at the border said as he pointed to the empty seats on his bus.\n\nThe Gibraltar Government has also introduced restrictions to restrict the use of buses."}}
