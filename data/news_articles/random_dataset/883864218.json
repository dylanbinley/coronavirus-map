Let\u2019s just say as a debt collector and salesman, not everyone wanted to hear from him as much as they do now.\n\n\u201cNow I feed people and I don\u2019t even know how to take the feedback,\u201d Baldwin said.\n\nAlways a fan of barbecue, Baldwin cut his chops about four years ago at the former Smokeman BBQ in Crystal Beach. At the time, the Baldwins were commuting back and forth from Lockport.\n\n\u201cI made some great regular customers who turned into friends and made some real headway with my food,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI left there with a certain amount of confidence in my ability behind the restaurant and a certain amount of confidence in my ability in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nAfter a little more time selling insurance and a little more time honing his barbecue expertise at a different restaurant \u2014 actually, make that long days and long nights, a lot of hard work, a lot of mistakes, and a lot of learning from them, Baldwin said \u2014 the couple, who have since moved to the area, decided to take the plunge with their own place, with the help of several partners.\n\nFinger Lakes Barbecue Company seats 28, with plans in the works to seat another 30 outside next summer. They have an application in for beer and wine.\n\nTheir custom-built, all wood-fired pit \u2014 a picture hangs on the back wall of the restaurant \u2014 is fired up at 2 a.m.\n\n\u201cWhat we have that really puts us leaps and bounds above any other barbecue in the area is brisket,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cMy measure of a barbecue joint is the brisket. Brisket is a tough one.\u201d\n\nThe focus may be on the brisket, but pork and beef ribs, pork butt, and chicken \u2014 the recently added Wednesday chicken wing nights are popular \u2014 will make you think really, really hard about what to order.\n\nThe open kitchen provides accountability, as well as a chance to talk with customers.\n\nBrian Turner, who comes in at least once a week for lunch, said the Baldwins are super friendly.\n\n\u201cThey recognize us every time we come in,\u201d Turner said. \u201cThey pretty much put our order in as soon as we come in the door.\u201d\n\nAnd for regular customer John Rosato, that means a \u201cperfect smoked\u201d ribs lunch, his weekly favorite.\n\n\u201cI love the ribs,\u201d Rosato said. \u201cI\u2019ve had their pulled pork and the brisket\u2019s really good. I come every week and mostly get ribs.\u201d\n\nHomemade sauces include the popular house brand, sweet and spicy styles, along with a mustard sauce, Daddy\u2019s Gold. The \u201cBuffacue\u201d sauce for wings, which is the house barbecue, butter and Frank\u2019s Red Hot sauce, puts their own touch on a Buffalo staple.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got that Frank\u2019s bite. It\u2019s got that smoothness from the butter,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cIt\u2019s got all the flavor profile of our house barbecue sauce.\u201d\n\nTheir plan was to start small, with a handful of plates and sandwiches along with sides, but more items will be rolled out in the days and weeks ahead, including a cherry-wood smoked prime rib.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely one of my favorite non-traditional barbecue items that we deal with,\u201d Baldwin said.\n\nThe food is fresh and cooked every day because Baldwin said for one, leftovers are for home; and two, freshness is the key to a consistently good plate of barbecue every time you go.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to come into our business and you\u2019re going to spend your hard-earned money, I'm going to give you the right thing,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cThere\u2019s something about good, homemade food and being served it by the people who made it for you that people connect with \u2014 it forms a bond.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s also what they\u2019re working to build here.\n\n\u201cAbove everything else, we\u2019re barbecue fans,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cWe like barbecue. People like barbecue. It\u2019s a culture. It\u2019s a thing people chase and follow and identify with. For us it\u2019s very much a culture that we\u2019re developing here.\u201d\n\nThe decision to uproot was scary at first and there have been a few unexpected twists and turns, but so far, it\u2019s worked out for the best, Kim Baldwin said.\n\nYou can\u2019t beat food and friends to share it with, and for them, it sure beats being \u201cthe most hated person on the phone,\u201d as Baldwin described his days in debt collecting.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be that spot in the cubicle, and they will always need to fill that cubicle,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get a chance like this very often, so you have to take it.\u201d"}}
