The brothers have their own families, with William and Kate taking care of three children, and Meghan and Harry doting over three-month-old baby Archie. Harry and Meghan departed Kensington Palace for the rolling Windsor countryside to raise their son earlier this year. Since then, speculation has mounted that there is bad blood between the Cambridge and Sussex houses, and a new documentary has revealed this may extend much further into the past.\n\nWhile perceived fractures in the Royal Family are the result of the Sussex bid for independence, royal experts insist there was an earlier childhood split between the brothers. Experts speaking on the \u2018Princes At War\u2019 documentary said Princes Harry and William fell out when the heir to the throne used his brother as a \u201cdecoy\u201d. Simon Vigar, Channel 5 royal correspondent, said William used Harry to protect his image during parties in their youth. He said: \u201cHarry has obviously got into some scrapes which have landed him on the front pages of the newspapers but at plenty of those parties, particularly the teenage parties, William was there, Harry served as a really useful decoy.\u201d READ MORE: Prince Harry's 'pen pal' reveals cheeky joke from Duke on bizarre item\n\nPrince William vs Harry: The real reason behind split - 'Harry couldn't forgive him\u2019\n\nRoyal author Katie Nicholl said Prince Harry refused to forgive William for \u201csome time\u201d after taking the blame. She said: \u201cThat was the first time the brothers really fell out because Harry resented the fact that he had taken all the blame but of course William was the heir, Harry took the flack and Harry was very cross about that. \u201cHe refused to speak to his brother or forgive him for some time.\u201d The Cambridge-Sussex split has now taken to social media, as the Cambridge family has removed traces of Meghan and Harry from their Instagram profile.

Two new charitable organisations sprung forth, Sussex Royal, and The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. A \u2018change of name\u2019 form released today by the Companies House revealed official documents had struck mentions of Meghan and Harry from the charity. While people see the latest development as further evidence of an ongoing feud, the Palace has denied this is the case.

They told the Daily Mail: \u201cIt was largely about preparing both couples for their future roles, which are obviously on divergent tracks.\u201d The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have developed their own organisation by appointing Kate Blackett, 48, as director of Sussex Royal. Ms Beckett, an OBE recipient, was 2015 Powerlist number one of the 100 most influential people of African or African Caribbean heritage in the UK.\n\nMeghan and Harry had allegedly made a bid for the empty rooms in Windsor Castle"}}
