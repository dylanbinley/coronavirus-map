Nine additional deaths also were reported, although one happened a week ago and another reported to the health department occurred more than a month prior.\n\nSix deaths were among residents of long-term care facilities.\n\nNinety-seven Bucks residents are hospitalized, the county said, with 20 on ventilators. Nearly 1,500 people have recovered from the illness.\n\nMontgomery County was reporting 142 new cases as of Wednesday, a total of 6,688 since early March. More than 660 people have died, with 66 new deaths reported Wednesday."}}
