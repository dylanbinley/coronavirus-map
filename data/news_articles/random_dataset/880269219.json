Kogi State belongs to all of us and we shall work together to ensure Bello\u2019s re-election,\u201d he said.\n\nReacting to the NURTW\u2019s endorsement\u2019s of the governor second term ambition, Adeyemi described the union as powerful and important to the socio-economic development of the state.\n\n.Copyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.
