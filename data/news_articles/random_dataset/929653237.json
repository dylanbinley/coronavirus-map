We are within touching distance of a better Ireland. Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il can delay change, but they cannot stop it,\u201d he said.\n\nDeputy Stanley is the first of the five TDs in Laois Offaly to respond to the agreement which now must be sanctioned by the membership of the three parties involved."}}
