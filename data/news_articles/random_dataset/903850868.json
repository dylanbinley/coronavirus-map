This year, he may try to make them harder to find by putting them under the sea.\n\nRecent North Korean reports touting a new submarine and its test of a ballistic missile designed to be launched from one have fueled speculation that a sub may be the \u201cnew strategic weapon\u201d Kim promised to unveil this year. While such a vessel would probably be noisy and unable to stray far from the coast without being tracked, it may be enough to serve Kim\u2019s needs.\n\nEven one submarine lurking off the Korean Peninsula, beyond the gaze of spy satellites, would give U.S. military planners a dangerous new threat to consider in the event of any conflict. And for Kim, anything that makes it harder for the U.S. to imagine an actual war, brings him closer to a goal that alluded his father: international recognition as a nuclear state.\n\n\u201cIn terms of war planning, the U.S., South Korea, and Japan need to take the undersea nuclear threat seriously and plan for anti-submarine warfare contingencies,\u201d said Ankit Panda, an adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists and author of the upcoming book \u201cKim Jong Un and the Bomb: Survival and Deterrence in North Korea.\u201d\n\nThis 2017 satellite image shows a suspected North Korean SINPO-class submarine and submersible test stand barge berthed in the secure boat basin. DigitalGlobe/Getty Images\n\nKim has kept the world guessing since pledging in a Dec. 31 speech to build a more powerful nuclear deterrent. Although a \u201cstrategic weapon\u201d could include everything from advanced intercontinental ballistic missiles to multiple warhead payloads and more powerful atomic bombs, the secretive regime has publicly said it was making \u201cbig efforts\u201d to expand its missile-carrying submarine fleet.\n\nLaunching a nuclear-weapons capable sub would provide the clearest illustration yet of Kim\u2019s efforts to bolster his arsenal despite President Donald Trump\u2019s June 2018 assertion that North Korea \u201cno longer\u201d posed a nuclear threat. Even before agreeing with Trump to \u201cwork toward complete denuclearization,\u201d Kim had demonstrated his ability to build hydrogen bombs and missiles capable of carrying them to any city in the U.S.\n\nA flurry of shorter-range missile tests last year showed the regime has since made progress toward developing solid-fuel rockets that are easier to hide, faster to deploy and harder to intercept. Among those was a submarine-launched ballistic missile that flew 910 kilometers (565 miles) into space on Oct. 2, giving it an estimated horizontal range of about 1,900 kilometers.\n\nThat could put all of South Korea and Japan \u2014 together home to about 170 million people including some 80,000 U.S. troops \u2014 in range of a submarine hidden off North Korea\u2019s eastern coast. There, a vessel could hide among others from the country\u2019s fleet of 60 to 80 smaller submarines, leaving the allies unsure which, if any, are nuclear armed.\n\nNorth Korea sent out a fresh reminder that it\u2019s ready for conflict with Japan, warning its mortal enemy in a state media report late Tuesday that \u201cit will fall into the abyss of ruin\u201d if it tries to flex its military might.\n\nVice Admiral Jon Hill, the head of the U.S.\u2019s Missile Defense Agency, expressed confidence in the allies\u2019 ability to counter a nuclear-armed submarine after the latest SLBM test. \u201cWe need to keep an eye on it and continue to assess that to make sure the architecture\u2019s in place to deal with it,\u201d Hill told a Center for Strategic & International Studies gathering in October.\n\nNorth Korea has already teased the construction of a submarine that may be able to carry the new missile, publishing photos in July of Kim inspecting a large vessel under construction. The photos appeared to show a modified version of the diesel-electric Romeo-class vessels that comprise about one-third of the Korean People\u2019s Navy fleet, said Joseph Dempsey, a London-based research associate for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n\nNorth Korea acquired seven Romeo-class submarines from China in the mid-1970s and began producing them domestically from kits until 1995, according to a study by the Nuclear Threat Initiative. The newer version appears to have an enlarged \u201csail\u201d \u2014 the highest part of the vessel \u2014 to accommodate about three missile launch tubes, Dempsey said.\n\nNorth Korea was thought to have been developing another, more advanced submarine that weapons experts have dubbed the Sinpo C. So far, analysts haven\u2019t been able to confirm its existence using publicly available sources such as state-run media reports or satellite images.\n\nThe modified Romeo design demonstrates North Korea\u2019s commitment to exploiting the limited material it can acquire under strict international sanctions to offset the military advantages of its much wealthier rivals in South Korea and the U.S. The country\u2019s submarine fleet \u2014 among the world\u2019s largest \u2014 has long been a key part of that strategy.\n\nMost of North Korea\u2019s submarines are smaller craft \u201cdesigned to disrupt sea lanes, lay mines, attack surface vessels, and assist special operations units\u2019 infiltration,\u201d according to a white paper from South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry. Seoul blamed such a vessel for firing a torpedo that sank its corvette Cheonan in 2010, killing 46 \u2014 a claim denied by North Korea.\n\nThat\u2019s a very different mission than the U.S. Navy\u2019s much larger nuclear-powered Virginia Class attack submarine, which can sit quietly submerged off an enemy\u2019s coast until its time to launch missiles from its dozen launch tubes. North Korea\u2019s Navy doesn\u2019t need to venture so far, be as stealthy or carry as many weapons.\n\n\u201cThe scenario of a North Korean submarine creeping out into the Pacific with a nuclear-capable ballistic missile on board might capture the imagination, but it has little basis in reality,\u201d said Panda, of the Federation of American Scientists.\n\nThe real value in a nuclear-armed submarine may be in its potential to strengthen Kim\u2019s position in negotiations with the U.S. Each advance toward a more credible nuclear weapon raises the costs of any American-led military action and reduces Washington\u2019s leverage toward eliminating \u2014 rather than reducing or capping \u2014 his nuclear arsenal.\n\nNorth Korea sees its submarine as an underwater complement to the land-based missile transporters that it has demonstrated with increasing effectiveness in recent years, said Dempsey, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. They just need another platform to divide the attention of U.S. and South Korean military commanders.\n\n\u201cFor the purposes of providing an initial at-sea nuclear capability, this approach could be sufficient,\u201d Dempsey said. \u201cAll they need to do is avoid being detected,\u201d he said, \u201cso they can launch their missile.\u201d\n\nGet The Brief.
