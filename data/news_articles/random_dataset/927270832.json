Pounds / Hearst Connecticut Media Image 1 of / 6 Caption Close New charges in George Floyd\u2019s death \u2018by no means a victory,\u2019 advocates say 1 / 6 Back to Gallery\n\nProminent members of Connecticut\u2019s black community reacted Wednesday to the elevation of charges against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin and the arrests of three other former officers in the death of George Floyd.\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison is upgrading the charge against Chauvin to second-degree murder, and charging Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.\n\nScot X. Esdaile, president of the Connecticut NAACP, called Ellison\u2019s decision the \u201cright thing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that we have to go through all this just for them to do the right thing, which they should have done from the start,\u201d Esdaile said. \u201cPolice are supposed to protect and serve, but when something like this happens, we have to jump through all these hoops and twists and turns, with riots, burning of buildings and we have to turn the whole country upside down just to get justice.\u201d\n\nWhile Esdaile said the decision to prosecute Chauvin for second-degree murder, as well as charging the three other police officers who were present when Floyd died, was a step in the right direction, he warned that this is \u201cby no means a victory yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we have to stay vigilant and continue to keep the pressure to make sure that justice is truly served,\u201d he said.\n\nThe charges come days after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz asked Ellison to take over the prosecution, which until Sunday had been led by the Hennepin County Attorney's Office.\n\nThe Rev. Boise Kimber, pastor of First Calvary Baptist Church in New Haven and a longtime civil rights activist, said he thanks the governor of Minnesota for appointing that state\u2019s attorney general to lead this investigation.\n\n\u201cIt ceases to amaze me again that the district attorney could only come up with third-degree murder and manslaughter and did not move to arrest the other three officers expeditiously, but they are arrested today,\u201d Kimber said. \u201cI think that we should ask the governor of our state to give police brutality cases to our attorney general.\u201d\n\nDorie Dumas, president of the Greater New Haven Branch of the NAACP, said the arrests are what has been advocated for by so many, and it is an important move in the right direction.\n\n\u201cBut we do not want just the arrests; we want to see convictions,\u201d Dumas said.\n\n\u201cWe are going to keep watching \u2026 for them to do the right thing,\u201d Dumas said.\n\nDumas said she hopes to see real, systemic changes. She said in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death, she has seen many young people confused, angry and upset.\n\n\u201cI think people are at a point where they can\u2019t take it anymore and they have to see some real change,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone should be treated with dignity. Nobody deserves the injustice we have seen.\u201d\n\nGreg Johnson, who heads the Naugatuck Valley NAACP, said all of the officers should be prosecuted \u201cto the full extent of the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cRacism and hate should not be welcome in any community,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cLooking at the video. ... I\u2019m not an attorney, but my gut feeling is the state and federal government should prosecute to the full extent of the law.\u201d\n\nHe said a federal grand jury should be impaneled to bring charges of violating constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cNot only should there be federal and state charges, but a civil suit must be filed,\u201d Johnson said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been questions in the minority community that police are not held accountable for their actions,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson has been a leader in calling for an end to racism in the Naugatuck Valley communities.\n\nHe questioned Ansonia police in 2018 when the Central Connecticut State University Institute for Municipal and Regional Policy listed the department among eight in the state as having a disparate percentage of motor vehicle stops involving minorities.\n\nHe sought an investigation into the Derby Police Department following a 2018 complaint that officers singled out a group of minority teenagers who lingered after the annual Fourth of July fireworks display.\n\nLast year, he urged Shelton\u2019s school system to institute racial bias protocols and schedule diversity workshops after a series of racially insensitive incidents involving students. One involved an Intermediate School student spitting on a black person during a school trip to the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. This led to all of the Shelton students being asked to leave.\n\nStaff writer Michael Mayko contributed to this story."}}
