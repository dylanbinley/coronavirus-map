Lima of Medford.\n\nWrublewski and Lima filed the lawsuit against Post Consumer Brands of Minnesota. They claim that the advertising and packaging of the popular cereal, Honey Bunches of Oats, was misleading.\n\n\u201cBy making false, deceptive, and misleading representations, and by omitting material information, Defendant\u2019s branding and packaging of these cereals convey that honey is the primary sweetener, or at the very least is a significant sweetener,\u201d according to their lawsuit. \u201cIn truth, however, the cereals are sweetened primarily with sugar, corn syrup, and other refined substances, and contain only miniscule amounts of honey.\u201d\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the advertising and box prominently features an image of honey. They said, due to that, it led them to believe that honey was the sweetener rather than sugar. Because of that, they believed the cereal was a healthier option.\n\n\u201cAs part of a societal trend toward consuming healthier foods and natural foods, avoidance of added sugar has been and remains a significant consumer preference, with consumers strongly favoring honey as a sugar substitute,\u201d according to the suit. \u201cThus, the branding and packaging of the Products convey the clear message that honey is the primary sweetener or \u2013 at a minimum - that honey is a significant sweetener compared to sugar and other refined substances that are perceived by consumers to be unhealthy or less healthy. Unfortunately for consumers, this message is simply untrue.\u201d\n\nAccording to the suit, Wrublewski began eating Honey Bunches of Oats Cereal after seeing a television add in mid-2017 that showed the cereal box which \u201cemphasized the presence of honey, and an ingredient. Because of that, she believed the cereal was healthy and instructed her husband to buy a box.\n\n\u201cAt home, Plaintiff observed that the front of the box of \u2018Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds\u2019 was identical to the box depicted in the commercials, and therefore proceeded to consume the cereal for breakfast. Plaintiff enjoyed the cereal and therefore started purchasing and consuming it regularly,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nWrublewski only stopped eating the cereal when she read the ingredients and discovered all of the other sweeteners, such as sugar, corn syrup and brown sugar, were used.\n\nThe suit sought monetary damages for the two defendants and anyone who had been deceived by the \u201cmisleading\u201d practices of Post.\n\nPost filed a motion to dismiss, denying they ever said honey was the main sweetener for the cereal. They said honey was used as flavor and the ingredients listed on the box properly listed all ingredients.\n\nOn Aug. 13 of this year, U.S. District Court Judge Allison Burroughs granted Post\u2019s motion to dismiss. She said neither the box nor the advertising ever stated that honey was a main sweetener.\n\n\u201cThe packaging at issue is fully compliant with the federal statutory (rules),\u201d she wrote in her decision.\n\nBurroughs said that even the plaintiffs agreed honey was a main flavor component. Honey, she wrote, is an ingredient, so the labeling is not misleading. Burroughs wrote there was no \u201cexpress promise,\u201d that it was being used as a sweetener.\n\nWrublewski and Lima filed a motion for the judge to reconsider her ruling. They argued that since honey is a natural sweetener, it would be natural for anyone looking at the boxes or advertising would believe that the cereal was sweetened with honey.\n\nIn denying the motion, Burroughs disagreed with that argument.\n\n\u201cBecause Honey Bunches of Oats contains honey, the court found, that under relevant regulations, the packaging was not objectively misleading as a matter of law,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nWrublewski could not be reached for comment on Friday.\n\nNorman Miller can be reached at 508-626-3823 or nmiller@wickedlocal.com.
