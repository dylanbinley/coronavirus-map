It felt like a head dive into emptiness. I did not know if there would be a net or hard concrete under me,\" said Katja Grundner, a woman from Austria, who embarked on an epic adventure of a lifetime \u2013 one that many people only dream of.\n\nIn her 15-month long journey across the foreign landscapes of Europe and Asia, Katja was not alone. Intertwined with a bond of love, trust, and companionship, Momo, Katja's four-legged companion, a female Malinois dog, also accompanied her.\n\nTogether, they splashed in Russia's Lake Baikal, explored the dense jungles in Cambodia, walked along paradisiacal beaches in Thailand, visited an indigenous tribe in Myanmar, got to appreciate Indian culture, hiked to a peak over 4,000 m in the western Himalayas, celebrated traditional festivals with Pakistanis, lived with an Iranian family, and got to know the helpfulness of the Turkish people.\n\nAcross The Continent And Into The Unknown"}}
