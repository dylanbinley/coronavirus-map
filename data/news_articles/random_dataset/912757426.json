If you have fever, monitor it for seven days. If you have respiratory problem along with fever contact the doctors,\u201d the CM said.\n\nDhankhar suspends all events at Raj Bhavan\n\nIn view of Covid-19 outbreak, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Monday postponed all his official programmes to be held at Raj Bhavan in March.\n\n\u201cIn deference to the advisory as regards to coronavirus, it has been decided to reschedule all programmes at Raj Bhavan and a call thereof will be taken after March 31, 2020\u2026 The expedient change has been dictated by public interest,\u201d said a statement issued by Raj Bhavan.\n\nYouth back from Thailand among five in isolation ward\n\nFive more people, including a 19-year-old man who returned from Thailand, with coronavirus-like symptoms were admitted to the isolation wards of Beliaghata ID and BG Hospital on Monday, taking the total count to 15.\n\nOn Sunday, six of the patients had tested negative. They are yet to be discharged from the hospital. Sample results of the rest are awaited.\n\nAccording to a doctor at the hospital, the 19-year-old man showed coronavirus-like symptoms during thermal scanning at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.\n\nThe number of coronavirus cases in the country rose to 114, with Odisha recording its first Covid-19 case and a new case each in Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, and Kerala, according to the Union Health Ministry.\n\nBelur Math stops distributing bhog\n\nThe Belur Math administration, the global headquarters of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission, stopped distributing \u2018bhog\u2019 to devotees for an indefinite period from Monday as part of efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus. \u2018Bhog\u2019 is the food served to devotees at a temple after prayers.\n\nAuthorities at Belur Math said they would also regulate the entry of devotees by ensuring they do not crowd the temple complex.\n\nDakshineswar may cut visiting hours\n\nAt Dakshineswar Kali temple, the management is planning to reduce the visiting hours for pilgrims, said Kushal Choudhury on behalf of the temple trust. Personnel manning the temple entry points had been asked to maintain a gap between people in a queue, and prevent overcrowding, he added.\n\nPark Circus sit-in to continue\n\nWomen, who have been protesting against the new citizenship law (CAA) and proposed NRC at Kolkata Park Circus for more than a month, on Monday said that they would continue their sit-in by taking precautions in view of coronavirus outbreak.\n\nProtesters have been asked to use gloves, masks and sanitisers while taking part in the protest.
