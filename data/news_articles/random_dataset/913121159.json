She noted that Lima, Peru, where the CIP genebank is located, has been wracked by earthquakes over the years, whereas parts of the city were flooded in 2017.\n\nThe Svalbard Global Seed Vault provides permanent backup storage, at -18\u00b0C, for seeds from the world\u2019s genebanks. NordGen \u2013 the organization that manages the seed vault in coordination with the Crop Trust and Norway\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture and Food \u2013 uses a \u201cblack box\u201d system, which means only depositors can touch or withdraw their seeds. Whereas genebanks routinely share their accessions with other organizations, the seed vault is strictly for storage.\n\nThe CIP genebank preserves most\n\nof its collections as in vitro plantlets.\n\nGenebanks safeguard a vast sampling of the world\u2019s crop biodiversity, much of which is threatened by environmental destruction, extreme weather, and the global trend of farmers shifting from traditional varieties to modern ones.\n\nYet some ancient varieties and their wild relatives have characteristics that breeders can use to develop the resilient varieties that farmers will need to cope with future climates, which makes genebanks increasingly important.\n\nCIP\u2019s recent deposit of 236 seed samples of sweetpotato and wild relatives of several crops were added to the 9,206 seed samples that CIP had previously sent to Svalbard. However, Svalbard is just one of several places where the CIP genebank backs up its collections.\n\nThe CIP genebank conserves more than 4,800 potato accessions\u2014from rare Andean native potatoes to internationally grown varieties\u2014and more than 5,500 sweetpotato accessions as in vitro plantlets. However, the Svalbard facility only stores seeds, so CIP can back up only a portion of its collections there, primarily wild relatives of potato and sweetpotato.\n\nCIP backs up its in vitro potato collection with the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), and its in vitro sweetpotato collection at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), Colombia. CIP reciprocates by storing a backup of CIAT\u2019s in vitro cassava collection. All these backups are black box arrangements, like the Svalbard deposits. Most of CIP\u2019s potato, sweetpotato and Andean root and tuber collections are also backed up at the Center\u2019s research station in Huancayo, in the Peruvian Andes.\n\nCIP has also backed up 3,277 potato accessions using cryopreservation, in which plant tissue is stored in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -196\u00b0C. Cryopreservation is a cost-effective long-term option for safeguarding potato biodiversity, but CIP\u2019s cryopreserved collection is currently held only in its Lima genebank. Anglin is thus exploring options for backing it up elsewhere.\n\nSource: CIP\n\nShare this news story with colleagues: Facebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTwitter\n\nSkype\n\nWhatsApp\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\nReddit\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\nPocket\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n"}}
