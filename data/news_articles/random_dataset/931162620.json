(AP) \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence planned to start a faith-centered tour in Milwaukee suburbs on Tuesday, after touting Wisconsin\u2019s school-choice program for the second time this year.\n\nPence\u2019s events come two days before President Donald Trump was to campaign in northeast Wisconsin. Trump planned to tour the Fincantieri Marinette Marine shipyard and tape a town hall meeting at the Green Bay airport, an event to be broadcast Thursday night on Fox News.\n\nThe dual visits in one week show Wisconsin\u2019s importance in the presidential race. Trump carried the state by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016. Trump and Pence are visiting parts of Wisconsin that Trump won that year and where he must bolster that support this year if he hopes to beat his Democratic rival, Joe Biden.\n\nPence\u2019s \u201cFaith in America\u201d event in Pewaukee will draw attention to the central position that religious conservatives \u2014 particularly white evangelicals, but also right-leaning Catholics \u2014 continue to occupy in the president\u2019s base. Trump was going to a Phoenix megachurch on Tuesday. Former Republican Gov. Scott Walker was to join Pence at the Wisconsin event.\n\nAbout 200 chairs were spaced a few feet apart from one another inside the hotel where the faith rally was planned, as a precaution amid the coronavirus pandemic. Those in attendance had to undergo temperature checks before entering, and masks and hand sanitizer were also available. Those who reserved tickets for the event had to agree not to sue the Trump campaign if they later became sick. The campaign required attendees to sign a similar waiver before its rally in Oklahoma on Saturday.\n\nAt Pence\u2019s first Wisconsin event, a school-choice panel inside the Waukesha STEM Academy, no one wore masks. Pence was joined on the panel by U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, and parents and local education leaders for the discussion.\n\nPence and DeVos also both appeared at a school-choice rally in Wisconsin\u2019s state Capitol in January. Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, who is running for Congress representing a district that includes Waukesha, also attended, along with students and others in the audience.\n\nPence touted Wisconsin for \u201cgroundbreaking work\u201d as the birthplace of the school choice program, which began in Milwaukee 30 years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here in Wisconsin because this is where it all began,\u201d Pence said.\n\nHe advocated for passing a $5 billion federal tax-credit program to pay for scholarships to private and religious schools.\n\nSchool choice \u2014 which refers to policies related to private-school vouchers, charter schools and other nonstandard options \u2014 has long been an issue that divides Republicans and Democrats, particularly in Wisconsin. Conservatives have championed offering students an alternative to public schools, but Democrats argue the policies take away needed resources from public schools with less accountability.\n\nBoth of Tuesday\u2019s events are in Waukesha County, a stronghold of Republican support in Wisconsin. Trump carried the county with 60% of the vote, under-performing Republican Mitt Romney\u2019s showing in 2012. Doing better in the Milwaukee suburbs is one part of Trump\u2019s strategy for winning Wisconsin.\n\nThe Biden campaign spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield derided the Pence visit as an attempt to \u201cclean up Trump\u2019s mess\u201d in fighting the coronavirus pandemic. She called the president\u2019s handling of the coronavirus \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d referring to Trump\u2019s recent comments about wanting to slow down testing."}}
