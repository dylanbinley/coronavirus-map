Taiwan became an aged society in 2018, and is set to be super-aged by 2026 when at least 20 percent of the population is 65 or more.\n\nTACA Chairman Kobe Chih (\u6c60\u570b\u5e73) said that since 20.7 percent of Taiwan's population is forecast to be over 65 years old by 2026, it\u2019s a pressing issue for the government. As such, it is important for the government to plan programs to enhance the health of senior citizens and reduce the tremendous costs of the country's long-term healthcare plan.\n\nResearch seems to show that strengthening chewing ability can lower the risk of dementia and memory loss. Therefore, Chih urged the public to focus more on oral health. [FULL STORY]"}}
