It will be in English and the entrance is complimentary.\n\nThe first event to mark 500 years from the death of the artist and quirky inventor was a lecture at the Shoe Factory in May on \u201cRediscovering Leonardo da Vinci: The Secret Lives of his Paintings\u201d, delivered by Prof. Maurizio Seracini.\n\nIn Monday\u2019s lecture, Prof. Ekserdjian, one of the world\u2019s most renowned art historians, will share his experiences around the turbulent art of the unsurpassed artist, explaining why it is said that \u201cLeonardo\u2019s paintings had lives of their own\u201d.\n\nThe sale of the \u2018Salvator Mundi\u2019 for $450.3 mln at Christie\u2019s New York in November 2017, initially for public display at the Louvre Abu Dhabi, sparked once again the discussions about Leonardo\u2019s art.\n\nAccording to Giorgio Vasari, who composed the artist\u2019s biography, Leonardo attracted the interest, admiration, and sometimes anger or dislike of his contemporaries. His talent and excellence of his works, nonetheless, were undisputed.\n\nItaly and many other countries have dedicated this year to Leonardo via a multitude of events culminating with the largest ever exhibition on the artist at the Louvre in Paris.\n\nLeonardo\u2019s unconventional personality, as well as his tremendously detailed and intriguing paintings, exudes a mystery that has been captivating the interest of scholars and the general public alike since their creation.\n\nThe Ambassador of Italy in Cyprus, Andrea Cavallari, said: \u201cLeonardo da Vinci\u2019s legacy goes beyond borders and time. Besides being a reason of particular pride for us Italians, his life and works have become part of our common heritage that we are glad to share with anyone who cares about culture, science and humanity.\u201d\n\nArt historian Maria Paphiti, co-host of the event, said that the painting was owned by three kings, was subsequently lost and then rediscovered.\n\n\u201cThe man who spent the astronomical sum is the Saudi successor to the throne, Mohammed bin Salman, who bought the painting for it to end up in Abu Dhabi,\u201d said Paphiti.\n\n\u201cIn my view, no buyer originating from such a strictly Muslim country would bid so decisively for a purely Christian work of art. What interested him was to buy Leonardo\u2019s name, which immediately puts Abu Dhabi on the map of the world\u2019s most important museums,\u201d she added.\n\nOf course, Leonardo also had a link to Cyprus, with legend suggesting he visited the island in 1481, prompting the postal service to issue a three-stamp commemorative series to mark the 500th anniversary of that occasion.\n\nHistorians assume the visit took place during the reign of Catherine Cornaro, last queen of Cyprus, who entertained the famous painter.\n\nIt is said that Leonardo was so impressed by the intricate Lefkara lace, that he took one with him which he offered to be used on the Altar of the Cathedral of Milan.\n\nIn one of his notebooks, Leonardo writes: \u201cFrom the southern seaboard of Cicilia may be seen to the south the beautiful island of Cyprus which was the realm of the goddess Venus, and many there have been who, impelled by her loveliness, have had their ships and rigging broken upon the rocks that lie among the seething waves. Here the beauty of some pleasant hills invites the wandering mariners to take their ease among its flowery verdure, where the zephyrs continually come and go, filling with sweet odours the island and the encompassing sea\u2026\u201d.\n\nEkserdjian is also an expert on the history of collecting, an adviser to auction houses like Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s, international museums and galleries such as the National Gallery and Tate Britain, as well as private collectors.\n\nCurrently, alongside his academic position at Leicester University where he teaches art and film history, Ekserdjian is one of the two organisers of the major forthcoming exhibition on Raphael to take place in 2020 at the National Gallery in London on the occasion of the artist\u2019s 500th anniversary of his death. David Ekserdjian has published extensively \u2013 books, articles and reviews \u2013 and he frequently appears on television and radio.\n\nVideos:\n\nThe Wall Street Journal narrates the story of discovery and restoration of the \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d: https://youtu.be/PJb14H3Mz_o\n\nThe painting\u2019s sensational sale on 15 November 2017 at Christie\u2019s New York: https://youtu.be/3orkmMlSpmI"}}
