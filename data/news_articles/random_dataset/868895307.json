They enable patients to collect their repeat chronic medication in under two minutes, as opposed to waiting several hours in long queues at public clinics.\n\nAccording to Hutiri, the key focus townships his company operates in now include Mamelodi, Pretoria, Thembisa, Thokoza and Daveyton.\n\n\u201cWe have some of the new sites that are going up, including City of Ethekwini in Durban. We have decided to focus on a national-scale strategy instead of just provincial.\n\n\u201cWithin our pipeline focus, the other key critical provinces are Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, North West and Limpopo. Those are some of the provinces we would like to be operating in early next year, to make sure we can serve more people,\u201d he tells ITWeb.\n\n\n\nPelebox stations can be found at some public clinics across Gauteng.\n\nLight bulb moment\n\nHutiri, whose background is in engineering, says in 2014, he was diagnosed with Tuberculosis (TB), which required him to collect chronic medication from his local clinic in Bophelong Township in the Vaal.\n\nHe was on treatment for six months, and during this time, the engineer regularly collected his medication. However, his biggest challenge wasn\u2019t the treatment, rather the amount of time he was losing when going to collect his meds at the local clinic.\n\nHutiri reveals that, on average, he was losing about three-and-half hours every time he needed to collect his medicine.\n\n\u201cI started trying to figure out if there might be different ways of how we can solve this. My overall idea was to say: How do you build a solution that cuts across all of these challenges and deliver something that works, so the idea of the smart lockers is the one that came to me.\u201d\n\nA patient\u2019s chronic medication safely stowed in the Pelebox smart locker.\n\nAccording to Hutiri, the idea was to use technology to get somebody from three-and-a-half hours of queuing at public clinics to a couple of seconds. \u201cI am a strong believer around what we as South Africans can do with our hands, our hearts and our minds, not only always waiting for the Silicon Valley technologies to come save us.\n\n\u201cThe idea of a locker was something that I felt would cut across all other areas. Because the records of the patients collecting chronic medication are already available; then we can pre-pack their medicine and load it into the locker.\n\n\u201cOnce we have done that, the system automatically sends the patient an SMS saying the medication is ready for collection and here is a one-time PIN. The patient will simply walk to that self-service locker, enter their cellphone number, enter their PIN and it will open with their medicine inside.\u201d\n\nHe confirms that only chronic medication is stored in the smart lockers, treating different types of conditions like TB, hypertension, HIV, etc.\n\n\n\nChronic medication patients receive an SMS alert to notify them when medication is ready for collection.\n\nStakeholders get on board\n\nRealising he had a winning idea, Hutiri says he pitched it to anybody that would listen. \u201cIf you happen to tell me that you're a nurse in a healthcare space, I would effectively engage you.\u201d\n\nThe City of Tshwane would be the first critical stakeholder to get behind the Pelebox, saying it really liked the \u201cembryonic idea\u201d. It then got the National Department of Health involved, he states.\n\n\u201cAt the time, we were incubated at the Innovation Hub. The Innovation Hub was one of our biggest supporting stakeholders, primarily because their mandate is to support the propulsion of innovation that\u2019s South African, has a very strong public service orientation and leverages tech in a good way.\u201d\n\n\n\nA health worker assists a patient who is about to use the Pelebox smart locker.\n\nIn Tshwane, Hutiri\u2019s company ran a pilot project in Mamelodi Township in 2017, which he says was really successful.\n\n\u201cWe ran that pilot for about a year, where we needed to show that the technology can work.\n\n\u201cWe needed to ensure the smart lockers work within specific guidelines, such as the controlled temperature profile of the medicine and ensuring the right medication goes to the right patient 100% of the time. We had to ensure the solution isn\u2019t just something that works sometimes or not the other time.\u201d\n\nIn addition to getting the health department on board, the start-up is also receiving support from the Aurum Institute, according to Hutiri.\n\nThe Aurum Institute is a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that has its roots in healthcare, focusing on improving the lives of people and making sure people receive really good care.\n\n\u201cWorking within with an NGO like Aurum has been really super-amazing for us in that they provide a lot of the other oversight that we might not have; they provide a lot of other healthcare-related skills. I'm an engineer by background, so obviously I wasn't trained in public service or in healthcare.\n\n\u201cAnd having the Aurum Institute has really helped us in, first of all, scaling to get into more sites, reaching more patients, and going from a start-up to a scale-up.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe keypad to key in the one-time PIN to access a patient\u2019s medication.\n\nPurpose-driven innovation\n\nDespite having received support from key stakeholders and winning a number of awards over the years, Hutiri acknowledges the beginning was quite brutal.\n\nRetelling the story of a friend he was trying to convince to join the work he was doing, he says the friend called him crazy.\n\n\u201cMy friend said to me you're trying to build an innovation that is hardware-related, going into healthcare, which is one of the highly regulated sectors, with government as one of your biggest stakeholders. Also, you\u2019ll be dealing with schedule six and five medication, which again is highly regulated.\n\n\u201cIt was this momentous big mountain I felt like I was facing at the beginning, and it was quite challenging.\u201d\n\nBut, for Hutiri, the process has been rewarding, primarily because he sees the impact the locker has. \u201cSomebody goes to the Pelebox, enters the one-time PIN, door opens and the medicine is right there. I definitely feel that a project like this and building innovation that has large social impact has given me that sense of purpose.\u201d\n\nThis year, Hutiri\u2019s Pelebox solution scooped the Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation from Britain\u2019s Royal Academy of Engineering. \u201cThe global world of engineering has chosen this solution for the best innovation product, leveraging engineering skill for social impact.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re competing across multiple countries, you're competing across multiple innovations that come from different parts of the world and yet a South African invention comes out as a top winner. I was quite excited about that.\u201d\n\n"}}
