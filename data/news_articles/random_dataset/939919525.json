Results this year are not determined by pupils having sat exams. Instead, students have been given formal grades which fairly reflect the work they have put in. A-level and GCSE students in England are being promised their final results will be no lower than their mock exams. The Department for Education has announced a \"triple lock\" which means results will be the highest out of their estimated grades, their mocks and an optional written exam in the autumn. The move from the Department of Education follows Scotland's decision to switch to teachers' predicted grades.\n\nA-Level results day: Results were determined from predicted grades this year\n\nAll of the grades submitted by schools and colleges has been submitted to be checked nationally, to ensure they are fair and comparable to other years. The methods of deciding the results are broadly similar across all four nations and for qualifications including A-levels, GCSE's, Scottish Nationals and Highers. The exam boards put together the information, taking into account data for previous years, and make any necessary adjustments to the predictions. England's regulator Ofqual said the idea was to ensure confidence in the results, to give them the same value as grades from any other year."}}
