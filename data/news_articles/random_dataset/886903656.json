Carter", "TEXT": "Rep. Mark Meadows and Rep. Jim Jordan ripped into House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s \u201csham\u201d impeachment hearings on Fox News\u2019 Hannity Thursday night. During the impeachment probe\u2019s first public hearing Wednesday, witnesses William Taylor and George Kent couldn\u2019t recall ever having direct conversations with President Donald Trump, Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and the President\u2019s lawyer Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nTheir testimony was based on secondhand accounts of conversations involving White House officials. Rep. Meadows and Rep. Jordan signaled that would happen again Friday, during the committee\u2019s second public hearing.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff hasn\u2019t released the real transcripts. Technically, we\u2019re not allowed to use that material in hearings tomorrow,\u201d Rep. Jordan said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of problems with this.\u201d\n\nThe former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch is testifying as part of the ongoing impeachment probe Friday. Yovanovitch testified behind closed doors in October, but proved to never having direct knowledge of the President\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky. She left Ukraine in May to teach at Georgetown University.\n\n\u201cTomorrow, it\u2019s even better than that. The Ambassador who\u2019s coming in wasn\u2019t there during the phone call, wasn\u2019t there when the aid was suspended. You know where she was, she was at Georgetown,\u201d Rep. Meadows said.\n\nRep. Meadows argued that Amb. Yovanovitch has been one of the harshest critics of the President and slammed him in an earlier op-ed. \u201cIt\u2019s America first, not Ukraine first,\u201d Rep. Meadows argued.\n\n\u201cIf they want to start directing policy for the hardworking American taxpayer, they need to put their name on a ballot instead of putting their name on a witness list.\u201d"}}
