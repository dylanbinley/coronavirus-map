The German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that Tesla will invest up to \u20ac4 billion ($4.3 billion) into the Gigafactory.\n\nThe BBC reports Tesla had not yet been granted permission to build the factory, but had been given permission to make site preparations at its own risk.\n\n\"The Tesla plant has not yet been approved, and there is a legal requirement for an early release of the building specifications which clearly hasn't been met in this case,\" said Dirk Tessmer, the lawyer for Gr\u00fcne Liga who brought the case, in a statement. Gr\u00fcne Liga contests the factory could threaten the area's drinking water.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke\n\n\"This ruling shows Tesla is not above the law,\" added local Gr\u00fcne Liga chair Heinz-Herwig Mascher. The court is expected to reach a decision on Friday, Die Welt reports.\n\nLocal activists have also voiced concerns that the deforestation could threaten local wildlife, including a particularly vulnerable species of bat.\n\nOn its website, Tesla says it plans to replant an area three times as large as the factory site. \"We are also working to ensure plenty of clean drinking water through water-saving measures in the factory as well as a structural solution with and for the community in the medium term,\" it says.\n\nTesla declined to comment on the court ruling when contacted by Business Insider."}}
