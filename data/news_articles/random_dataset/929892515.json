(Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)\n\nMinneapolis to Replace Police with \u2018Transformative New Model\u2019\n\nThe Minneapolis City Council is starting a year-long process to try to figure out what will replace the city\u2019s police department, according to newly released details.\n\nThe council unanimously passed a resolution last week to pursue a \u201ctransformative new model\u201d of policing in the city, replacing the police department with a \u201ccommunity-led public safety system.\u201d The veto-proof vote came after protests erupted nationwide over the in-custody death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.\n\nAccording to the newly released text (pdf), the process will take a year and involve research and community engagement \u201cwith every willing community member in Minneapolis\u201d as officials try to create a new model of public safety.\n\nFloyd, 46, died after former police officer Derek Chauvin\u2014who now faces second-degree murder charges\u2014knelt on his neck for nearly 9 minutes. Calls for police reform have grown amid protests over Floyd\u2019s death and against police brutality.\n\n\u201cThe murder of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, by Minneapolis police officers is a tragedy that shows that no amount of reforms will prevent lethal violence and abuse by some members of the police department against members of our community, especially black people and people of color,\u201d City Council President Lisa Bender wrote in the resolution.\n\nCouncil members noted that Floyd was not the first person killed by Minneapolis police, and that he joins a \u201ctragically long list of names.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we respond to demands for immediate action to reduce police violence and support community safety, we will invite our community to help shape long-term transformative change, centering the voices of those most impacted by community violence and police violence,\u201d Bender said in a statement.\n\nProtesters march on Hiawatha Avenue while decrying the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 26, 2020. (Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)\n\nSince Floyd\u2019s death, there have been growing calls for officials to cut police funding and place greater emphasis on supporting essential social services. Organizers of the Black Lives Matter movement have stated they want \u201ca national defunding of police.\u201d\n\nThe demands of the \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement range from calls for redistributing funds from police budgets to complementary community-based solutions, to extreme proposals of entirely disbanding police departments.\n\nFloyd\u2019s death has also fueled national discussions on overhauling police procedures, including creating a national database of excessive-force encounters, banning the use of chokeholds, and limiting legal protections for police.\n\nThe resolution states that $193 million was allocated to the Minneapolis Police Department in its 2020 budget, and that the figure is more than double the funds allocated for areas such as building affordable housing, home ownership support, small business support programs, race equity, violence prevention, family and early childhood support, youth development, and protection of civil rights.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said last week that Floyd\u2019s death had made him committed to \u201ctransformative change,\u201d as he announced that the department would be pulling out from contract negotiations with the police union.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, meanwhile, has voiced opposition to dismantling the department, but said he is open to reform.\n\n\u201cWe need to entirely shift the culture that has for years failed black and brown people,\u201d he told NPR. \u201cWe need a full structural revamp. But abolishing the police department? No, I think that\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d\n\nThe council states in the resolution that the process will \u201ccenter the role of healing and reconciliation\u201d and will require \u201cdeep community engagement\u201d on race and public safety.\n\nThe council will create a \u201cFuture of Community Safety Work Group,\u201d which will include staff from a number of city departments, including the office of violence prevention and the department of civil rights. It has been tasked to deliver recommendations by July 24 on how to engage with community stakeholders to transform the public safety system.\n\n\u201cDecades of police reform efforts have not created equitable public safety in our community, and our efforts to achieve transformative public safety will not be deterred by the inertia of existing institutions, contracts, and legislation,\u201d the resolution states.\n\n\u201cTogether, we will identify what safety looks like for everyone.\u201d"}}
