So, for example, and I don\u2019t know this, but I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if they do press us to raise rates at a higher level and we do something in terms of water rates and all of that \u2013 those may be pressures that are applied by the Treasury and we will have to wait and see if that is the case.\u201d\n\nEdwin Poots said potentially the Executive may have to commit to raise extra revenue through the introduction of water charges or a hike in rates bills (Liam McBurney/PA)\n\nHis comments came amid media reports that the Government could be poised to announce a \u00a32 billion package.\n\nHowever, a Number 10 source described the figure as \u201cjust speculation\u201d.\n\nThe Irish Government has also made financial pledges within the agreement to honour commitments to part-fund some north/south projects, such as the A5 dual carriageway and a redevelopment of the Ulster canal system.\n\nStormont\u2019s new finance minister, Conor Murphy, said it was time for the administrations in London and Dublin to deliver their \u201cambitious commitments\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe local parties have done their part by restoring the powersharing Executive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe two Governments must now honour their pledge and provide the funding needed to deliver on the New Decade, New Approach document.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson said discussions at Stormont would focus on how the Executive intended to take forward \u201ccritical reforms\u201d to public services.\n\n\u201cThis is an historic time for the people of Northern Ireland,\u201d he said ahead of the visit.\n\n\u201cAfter three years, Stormont is open for business again with an Executive who can now move forward with improving people\u2019s lives and delivering for all communities in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cI look forward to meeting with the new Executive and hearing about their plans for the future \u2013 including driving forward much-needed reforms to public services and resolving the current health strike.\n\n\u201cThe next decade will be an incredible time of opportunity for Northern Ireland and the whole of the United Kingdom as we come together to unleash the potential of our four nations.\u201d\n\nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar is also travelling to Belfast as he and Boris Johnson mark the resurrection of the institutions after a three-year political impasse (Niall Carson/PA)\n\nMinisters will need to hit the ground running to tackle a host of acute problems facing a public sector that has been floundering amid the 36-month governance vacuum.\n\nTop of the Executive\u2019s in-tray is an industrial dispute in the health service that has seen nurses take strike action on three occasions in the last month.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, the new Executive will also take action to reduce spiralling hospital waiting lists; extend mitigation payments for benefit claimants hit by welfare reforms; increase the number of police officers on the beat; and resolve an industrial dispute involving teachers.\n\nThe last DUP/Sinn Fein-led coalition government collapsed in January 2017 over a row about a botched green energy scheme.\n\nThat row subsequently widened to take in more traditional wrangles on matters such as the Irish language and the thorny legacy of the Troubles."}}
