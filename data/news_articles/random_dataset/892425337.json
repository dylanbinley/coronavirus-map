Josh Hawley (R-Mo.). \u201cI do not believe that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a fundamental belief of mine that all people are created in the image of God,\u201d VanDyke added. \u201cThey should all be treated with dignity and respect, Senator.\u201d\n\nVanDyke\u2019s public emotional display came one day after ABA, which evaluates whether judicial nominees are fit for the federal court, went public with a scathing letter that determined he was \u201cnot qualified\u201d based on his temperament and animus toward LGBTQ people.\n\nDuring the course the interview with VanDyke himself, the nominee \u201cwould not say affirmatively that he would be fair to any litigant before him, notably members of the LGBTQ community,\u201d ABA reported.\n\nAfter the ABA letter went public, conservative criticized the legal group, which is charged with evaluating whether nominees are qualified on an objective basis. One of VanDyke\u2019s ABA raters, Marcia Davenport, donated to the opponent of his campaign when he ran in 2014 \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 for a seat on the Montana Supreme Court.\n\nLGBTQ advocacy and other progressive groups, including the Human Rights Campaign were united in their opposition to VanDyke and urged the Senate to vote against him.\n\n\u201cLawrence VanDyke has made clear that he has no intention of upholding the rights of LGBTQ people,\u201d HRC President Alphonso David said in a statement. \u201cFrom his college writings to his roles in government, VanDyke has spent his career consistently opposed to equality for all people, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nAlthough VanDyke asserts he\u2019d be fair to LGBTQ people seeking to have their civil rights affirmed before the judiciary, he has a record that suggests otherwise, including ties to the anti-LGBTQ legal firm Alliance Defending Freedom.\n\nWhen LGBT advocates were seeking to attain marriage equality through the federal judiciary, VanDyke, as Montana solicitor general, co-signed friend-of-the-court briefs in 2013 favoring the anti-gay Defense of Marriage Act and state bans on same-sex marriage.\n\nIn the same year, VanDyke joined another friend-of-the-court brief before the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Elaine Photography v. Wilock. Elaine Photography, represented by ADF, was found in violation of New Mexico law after it refused to shoot photos for a wedding for a same-sex couple. (The Supreme Court ended up not taking the case.).\n\nThe VanDyke confirmation is the latest in a ongoing slew of Trump judicial nominees with anti-LGBTQ records confirmed under by the Republican majority in the Senate under Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nAmong them is U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk of Texas, who worked as an attorney for the anti-LGBTQ First Liberty Institute. Another is U.S. Circuit Judge Kyle Duncan of the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, who defended a Virginia school in seeking to bar transgender student Gavin Grimm from the bathroom consistent with his gender identity.\n\nBut the Senate confirmed VanDyke the day after it confirmed Patrick Bumatay, who\u2019s gay and formerly a U.S. prosecutor in Southern California, to another seat on the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals."}}
