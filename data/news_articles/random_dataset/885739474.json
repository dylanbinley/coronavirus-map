( Supplied: Chante Ketu )\n\nThey started phoning around looking for another place to stay, but not many places were open.\n\nThey eventually found a place available in Currimundi, about 50 kilometres south, and drove there to spend the night.\n\n'So many people came forward'\n\nBut the next day, when the call was put out to help them find a new wedding venue, volunteers from across the Sunshine Coast came forward to help make their special day happen.\n\nChante and Jacob Ketu still managed to get married on Saturday. ( Supplied: Chante Ketu )\n\n\"I've never experienced anything like it \u2014 so many people came forward,\" Ms Ketu said.\n\nOne of her friends rang a radio station and then a prominent Maroochydore venue, the Rooftop Bar, came forward to make a wedding destination available.\n\nOthers offered help with make-up, hair and jewellery.\n\n\"A nice lady came forward from Caloundra and did my hair and make-up, our bridesmaids ended up buying dresses from Kmart, but we didn't care,\" Ms Ketu said.\n\n\"At that point, we were past caring. As long as we had clothes. The lady who did our hair and make-up lent me earrings, as I didn't have any.\"\n\nWhile the couple had not allowed a bushfire to ruin their wedding, there had not been time to plan the honeymoon.\n\nMs Ketu said the venues planned for the wedding at the Noosa North Shore had offered to refund their booking fees, which gives them money to plan that next.\n\nAnd as for the pig \u2014 it became such a part of the chaos it was given a name, Sally.\n\nIt was cut up and stored in fridges across the motel they were staying in and then was sent to the wedding party to take home with them."}}
