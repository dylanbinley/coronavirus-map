With the approval, state public health labs can order test kits and also start the work of validating the tests within their own labs to make sure their scientists are using it correctly, Scott Becker, the executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), said in a telephone interview.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not plug and play. They have to make sure a number of lab scientists in their labs are able to make the test work. This has to be right,\u201d Becker said.\n\nOnce the labs have the kits, Becker estimates they could start testing within five our six days. Initially, he said, labs will also send samples to the CDC to confirm their results.\n\nDr Joe Bresee, a CDC epidemiologist who is working on the outbreak response, said the kits contain a collection of reagents or enzymes that will give labs all of the necessary tools they need to test samples for the virus.\n\n\u201cWe hope to send at least one to every state health department and maybe more than one,\u201d Bresee said in a telephone interview.\n\nThe agency also hopes to share the kits with countries that may not currently have the ability to do their own testing, Bresee said.\n\nBecker expects each kit will cover testing for 400 or so patients.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, a bipartisan group of 38 U.S. lawmakers from across the country wrote a letter to the CDC asking the agency to quickly share tests with states.\n\nIn it, the lawmakers urged the CDC to \u201cprioritize localities where cases have already been confirmed, so that additional cases may be detected in real-time.\u201d\n\nUnder the emergency use authorization, testing is limited to qualified labs designated by the CDC.\n\n(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Additional reporting by Dania Nadeem in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli and Christopher Cushing)"}}
