Rising right-wing stars from Italy and France were keynote speakers, and conservative Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban closed out the meeting.\n\nOrganizer Christopher DeMuth drew applause when he blasted the World Economic Forum, the annual gathering of political and business elites in Davos, Switzerland. The threat of authoritarianism doesn\u2019t come from the right, DeMuth said, but the \u201cglobalist\u201d media, political and university establishment of the left.\n\n\u201cWe are called primitives, xenophobes, paranoids, racists. We are even called populists,\u201d he said to laughter. He said today\u2019s conservative nationalists are the \u201cdirect descendants and rightful heirs of the glorious revolution\u201d of the 1980s that brought down the Iron Curtain.\n\nItalian conservative Roberto de Mattei, a leading critic of Pope Francis and champion of John Paul, cited the condolences Francis offered after Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro died and a 2018 Vatican accord with China over Catholic bishop nominations as evidence that the Holy See supports communism under the Argentine pope.\n\n\u201cWe must not be afraid to say that communism is still alive,\u201d de Mattei said. \u201cBecause although the Soviet Union fell apart, the communist utopia continues to infect like a virus \u2013 a communist virus \u2013 western culture, media, politics and also the Catholic Church.\u201d\n\nSitting in the audience was Alexander Tschugguel, an Austrian far-right activist who is known in conservative Catholic circles for an episode that dominated Francis\u2019s meeting of Amazon-region bishops last year.\n\nTschugguel stole three statues of pregnant women from a Vatican-area church and threw them in the Tiber River, saying the statues were \u201cpagan\u201d idols that had been featured at Francis\u2019s Vatican. The stunt encapsulated the conservative and traditionalist opposition to Francis and the threat Francis\u2019s critics believe he poses to the Church.\n\nRod Dreher, author of The Benedict Option, recalled that as a young man in Poland, Karol Wojtyla \u2013 the future Pope John Paul II \u2013 staged historical plays with theater friends as a way to resist attempts by German Nazis and then communist authorities to erase Polish culture, history and religion.\n\n\u201cWe have to do the same in our time,\u201d Dreher said. \u201cPeople who lived through communist totalitarianism are trying to sound the alarm. They are trying to wake the rest of us up before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nThe conference was organized by the Edmund Burke Foundation based in the United States and other conservative intellectual and political groups. It took place on the eve of a Vatican conference on boosting forms of economic solidarity with the poor that features many of the \u201cglobalist\u201d leaders denounced by conservatives.\n\nCrux is dedicated to smart, wired and independent reporting on the Vatican and worldwide Catholic Church.
