Up to 50 students from around New Ireland are also attending the school as part of the Program. OLSH is an Internationally accredited school so we are certain that all students will get a world class education there,\u201d said CEO Subsidy Mactil Bais.\n\nA Marist representatives said they could assist but it would be more on short term capacity building, emphasising that Australia\u2019s Education system was totally different and adding onto that their teachers would need incentives to go New Ireland.\n\nThe New Ireland Government currently has a Scholarship Program with the Marist College where two New Ireland students are sent to study there.\n\nHowever, with PNG\u2019s current economic situation transferring money overseas has become a challenge.\n\nThus, the New Ireland Government is rethinking the program and discussions are going on about how to progress it and saving costs.\n\nSir Julius Chan was privileged to attend Marist College from 1954 to 1958 and knows too well the high standards the school has set set."}}
