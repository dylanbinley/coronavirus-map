Nigeria\u2019s ambassador to Lebanon, Goni Modu, reportedly told the women to \u201cgo back to their masters\u201d while they await evacuation.\n\nLebanon is currently undergoing a stringent financial crisis exacerbated by the pandemic which has led to increased job loss.\n\nHowever, these nine domestic workers don\u2019t hold normal jobs. African domestic workers in the Gulf and Arab countries are essentially domestic slaves \u2014 and the labour laws in these countries perpetuate the exploitation and abuse.\n\nDomestic slavery in the Gulf and Arab countries\n\nIn April, Temitope Olamide Ariowolo, 31, a Nigerian woman, was advertised for sale at $1,000 United States dollars on Facebook by Wael Jerro, a Lebanese man.\n\nJerro posted Ariowolo\u2019s international passport on the Facebook group, \u201cBuy and Sell in Lebanon,\u201d according to screenshots obtained by Middle East Eye before the post was deleted.\n\nA man has been arrested in Lebanon for allegedly putting up a Nigerian maid for sale. In a Facebook advert he had said the 30-year-old domestic worker could be bought for $1,000.\n\nRead more https://t.co/ZOpBkzFIgi #BBCAfricaLive pic.twitter.com/tjtlfQzLVp \u2014 BBC News Africa (@BBCAfrica) April 23, 2020\n\nJerro has since been arrested.\n\nBreaking news on Trafficked Nigerian girl for sale on Facebook by a Lebanese.\n\nThe Lebanese Govt just announced the arrest of Mr. WAEL JERRO for onward prosecution against criminal sales of a human, a young Nigerian girl.\n\n1/2 https://t.co/BBkIscyGHr \u2014 Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (@nidcom_gov) April 23, 2020\n\nBut Ariowolo refused to return to Nigeria even after the intervention of the Nigerian Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM) offered to evacuate her.\n\nAbike Dabiri, head of NIDCOM, stated that 69 abused domestic workers were evacuated back to Nigeria.\n\n50 trafficked Nigerian women have been rescued from Lebanon & returned home.They've all been placed in quarantine as a precaution against coronavirus.\n\nLast month,a Nigerian woman working as a maid in Lebanon was rescued after being put up for sale on Facebook for $1,000.\ud83d\ude25 pic.twitter.com/nspCTiLKqg \u2014 Josey Mahachie\ud83c\uddff\ud83c\uddfc \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea (@MahachieJosey) May 26, 2020\n\nEarly this month, the Lebanese Embassy in Nigeria suspended domestic work visas to \u201caddress rights, abuses and violations\u201d of Nigerian household staff in Lebanon.\n\nBut this abuse of household workers is not exclusive to Lebanon, \u2014 it is rampant throughout the Gulf region.\n\nDear @GeoffreyOnyeama @naptipnigeria @abikedabiri kindly help Nigerian ladies who are treated as slaves in the name of maids in #lebanon and #oman to come back home. Several of them are depressed, they need your help to come back home. Thank you. \u2014 adekola damilola (@adekoladammy) May 19, 2020\n\nIn August 2018, two Nigerian migrant domestic staff were killed in Riyadh by their Saudi Arabian hosts.\n\nYoung girls are usually recruited as housekeepers by registered agencies in Nigeria. Nigeria\u2019s Daily Trust newspapers revealed that contract stipulates that within the first 24-months, the servants \u201cmust not ask for a salary increment, stop work or runaway, or refuse to work or finish the contract, even for one day.\u201d\n\nThe Kafala system and migrant labour\n\nThe Kafala sponsorship system allows a migrant to work in Gulf and Arab countries by tying their immigration status to their employer. The conditions are slave-like because the migrant worker typically gives up most of their rights in exchange for a contract, allowing for abuse with impunity.\n\nBahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Jordan, and Lebanon, all actively participate in this system that provides temporary, cheap labour during economic prosperity and equally discarded during less affluent periods, according to the International Labour Organization:\n\nThe migrant worker cannot enter the country, transfer employment nor leave the country for any reason without first obtaining explicit written permission from the kafeel [employer]. The worker must be sponsored by a kafeel in order to enter the destination country and remains tied to this kafeel throughout their stay. The kafeel must report to the immigration authorities if the migrant worker leaves their employment and must ensure the worker leaves the country after the contract ends, including paying for the flight home. Often the kafeel exerts further control over the migrant worker by confiscating their passport and travel documents, despite legislation in some destination countries that declares this practice illegal.\n\nThis system, which requires the absolute dependence of the worker on their employer, is an obvious example of modern-day slavery. It promotes the abuse of migrant workers.\n\nFor instance, this Tanzanian woman was forced to work \u201clike a robot\u201d without rest or days-off in Oman for three years. Her employer constantly reminded her: \u201cI bought you for 1,560 rials ($4,052 USD) from Dubai. Give it back to me and then you can go,\u201d whenever she asked for food or improved working conditions.\n\nConsequently, migrant workers have two grim options: Put up with the exploitative conditions or escape.\n\nBut those who escape are not entitled to compensation. In fact, they \u201ccan be fined, indefinitely detained and deported,\u201d asserts Migrant Rights, an advocacy organization. It does not stop there \u2014 migrants abandoned by their sponsors can \u201cbe stranded for years\u201d since they cannot afford the cost of a return flight ticket to their respective countries.\u201d\n\nThere is no doubt that the sponsorship kafala labour laws perpetuate the exploitation of African domestic workers. However, African states are also often complicit.\n\nEthiopian journalist Zecharias Zelalem revealed that in 2007, the Ethiopian government hired a US-based public relations firm that lobbied US Congress to \u201cquash a bill condemning Ethiopia\u2019s human rights record.\u201d\n\nTo pay the PR firm, they misappropriated over $600,000 USD from its consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The embezzled funds had actually been raised by Ethiopians in Diaspora to rescue \u201cEthiopian domestic workers languishing in Lebanon,\u201d Zelalem learned.\n\nThe case was discussed on Twitter:\n\nAfter a spate of suicides by Ethiopian domestic workers in Lebanon,Ethiopians there raised $640,000 to support their community. Then it disappeared. None knew where it went, until now Via @mailandguardian pic.twitter.com/qVsSntJDvh \u2014 mwanaume.com (@MarigaThoithi) June 1, 2020\n\nIn many African nations including Nigeria, policy confusion, weak regulatory laws and enforcement \u2014 compounded by victims\u2019 desperation to migrate to greener pastures abroad \u2014 has fueled this human trafficking disguised as domestic work.\n\nThe Kafala system directly contravenes ILO's International Labour Standards that promote \u201cdecent and productive work, in conditions of freedom, equity, security and dignity.\u201d\n\nSadly, since the adoption of ILO's Decent Work for Domestic Workers Convention C189 in 2011, only 29 countries have ratified it. On the other hand, Gulf and Arab countries like Oman, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Lebanon \u2014 and their African counterparts like Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania \u2014 are yet to ratify and domesticate this law.\n\nThe redress of a bitter history of exclusion and injustice to migrant domestic workers may seem far-fetched. But Myrtle Witbooi, president of the International Domestic Workers Federation (IDWF) is optimistic: \u201cOne day, we will all be free,\u201d she said."}}
