She\u2019s also frequently identified as personal minister to the president and is now set to become an adviser heading Trump\u2019s Faith and Opportunity Initiative, according to a White House official.\n\nIn some ways, White\u2019s new position only formalizes her long-standing influence in the White House. The 53-year-old has known Trump for more than 15 years and frequently meets with the president alongside fellow evangelical Christian advisers, including a White House visit this week where the group laid hands on Trump in prayer. But White is a more contentious figure within her faith than other pro-Trump evangelicals and was the subject of a yearslong investigation into her finances by Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley.\n\nThat profile makes White, who uses her married name White-Cain, a compelling symbol for liberal Christians who are making an increasingly vocal appeal to religious Americans who do not align with Trump\u2019s broader political agenda.\n\n\u201cThe rise of the religious left has been given a shot in the arm every time Trump doubles down on his white evangelical base,\u201d said Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons, a religious activist on the left who created an anti-Trump network called The Resistance Prays. \u201cYes, he may score short-term political points. But in the long term, he really is energizing and mobilizing this whole swath of people who are religious and are astonished by what\u2019s happening with the Paula Whites of the world.\u201d\n\nJonathan Wilson-Hartgrove, a liberal evangelical preacher who works with the progressive group Red Letter Christians, said White\u2019s use of her ministry \u201cto exploit the poor \u2026 should be of real concern to all people of faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we often frame religion in public life as progressives to conservatives, it\u2019s important to say that even within that frame, Paula White is an extremist and always has been,\u201d Wilson-Hartgrove said.\n\nThe White House role for White, whose ministry did not immediately return an interview request, was first reported by The New York Times. White distanced herself from the prosperity gospel in a 2017 statement that said she would \u201creject any theology that doesn\u2019t affirm or acknowledge the entirety of scriptural teaching about God\u2019s presence and blessing in suffering as much as in times of prosperity.\u201d\n\nThe Florida-based White\u2019s website features a pitch for followers to purchase a $130 \u201cFavor Seed\u201d in order to help battle \u201can enemy of debt, depression, a job, or a health issue prevailing against you.\u201d\n\nThe White House initiative she will advise was created by the Trump administration last year to help faith-based groups partner with the federal government. White\u2019s advisory role, according to the executive order setting up the initiative, empowers her to suggest \u201cchanges to policies, programs, and practices that affect the delivery of services by faith-based and community organizations.\u201d\n\nBeyond White\u2019s new position, Trump\u2019s meeting this week with his closest conservative evangelical supporters included some discussion of how they would try to energize their contacts on the president\u2019s behalf, according to attendee Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council. Perkins said that while the meeting Tuesday with Trump was not entirely \u201ca planning session,\u201d attendees did perform \u201ca quick inventory\u201d of their own networks to determine what \u201cwe can do\u201d to help the president.\n\n\u201cSeveral of us have daily radio programs and some of us have TV programs and some of (us) lead very large churches and ministries,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cIt was more looking around the room and how do we be more intentional about getting this out there and using the platforms that we already have.\u201d\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\u00ab Previous\n\nNext \u00bb\n\nfiled under:"}}
