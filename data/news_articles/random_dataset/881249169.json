Submitting...\n\nCommunities across the bustling metropolis of Jacksonville and beach resorts of Mayport have been obsessing over their new 65,000-tonne VIP, with curious visitors lining Florida\u2019s sun-kissed shores to snap shots of the Portsmouth-based leviathan.\n\nThe state-of-the-art supercarrier arrived in the States a few weeks ago to carry out the second phase of tests seeking to sharpen the warfighting teeth of Britains new F-35 stealth jet.\n\nAnd in an unprecedented show of affection for a British warship, civic chiefs from across the state handed over a plaque declaring October 11 the official \u2018HMS Queen Elizabeth Day\u2019.\n\nCharlie Latham, mayor of Jacksonville Beach, presented the plaque to HMS Queen Elizabeth\u2019s commanding officer, Captain Steve Moorhouse, during a stopover at Naval Station Mayport.\n\nCapt Moorhouse was blown away by the gesture and said the welcome for his ship\u2019s company - and the supporting sailors from the rest of the Royal Navy task group in the US \u2013 had been overwhelming.\n\n\u2018The reaction has been absolutely fantastic,\u2019 he said. \u2018Such was the reception that we got during our last visit to Mayport that the mayor christened October 11 as HMS Queen Elizabeth Day in Mayport.\n\n\u2018You can\u2019t get a much more positive welcome than having a day named after you.\u2019\n\nFormer FBI agent Ellen Glasser, now mayor of Atlantic Beach near Mayport\u2019s naval base, was among the local leaders invited onto Queen Elizabeth to present the plaque \u2013 which now hangs in pride of place in the captain\u2019s cabin.\n\nThe mother-of-six, who is married to a former US Navy Seal, called on her community to give a fitting welcome to the British supercarrier, a plea which she said was answered in spades.\n\nThe counter-terrorism expert-turned-politician told The News: \u2018We opened our hearts. We put the news out on social media and the response was immediate and authentic. Our local businesses loved it and did roll out the red carpet.\n\n\u2018HMS Queen Elizabeth is truly inspiring and we definitely knew and felt how special this visit was. She is always welcome.\u2019\n\nRoyal Navy officer Commander Jamieson Stride, who is based at the British Embassy in Washington DC, oversaw the welcoming committee of Queen Elizabeth in Florida.\n\nHe said: \u2018The team enjoyed such warm hospitality in the beautiful area that lies around Naval Station Mayport and they have built many friendships that will last a lifetime.\n\n\u2018The ship sailed with sadness on both sides of the jetty but with great memories made and an enduring and special relationship fortified.\u2019\n\nQueen Elizabeth arrived in the states accompanied by Portsmouth-based Type 45 destroyer HMS Dragon, submarine-hunting frigate HMS Northumberland and tanker RFA Tideforce.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time the future flagship has visited the US as part of the \u2018Westlant\u2019 series of operations.\n\nThis year\u2019s trip is among the biggest and most important since Queen Elizabeth was commissioned into the navy in December 2017.\n\nMore than 2,000 British military personnel \u20131,250 of which are packed onto Queen Elizabeth \u2013 are part of the small task group in the US now.\n\nAnd their presence has not gone unnoticed by local residents, with many taking trips ashore to explore the mainland of Florida.\n\nTaxi driver Tyrone Williams, 34, lives in the nearby city of Jacksonville. The dad-of-two said he has picked up dozens of British sailors \u2013 including a pair who wanted to visit Disney World near Orlando.\n\nHe said: \u2018Queen Elizabeth is all everyone has been talking about. She\u2019s damn big. She was a huge attraction along the beaches. Everyone was trying to get photos.\n\n\u2018Everyone here is really excited by the ship\u2019s visit. It\u2019s not everyday you get to see so many British sailors here.\u2019\n\nQueen Elizabeth is now more than 100 nautical miles off the coast of Florida where she will be carrying out the bulk of her operational tests with the F-35 for the next five weeks.\n\nShe has four of the \u00a377m-a-piece jets on board, with plans to bulk this number up in the coming weeks with other British jets and a team of F-35 pilots from the US Marine Corps.\n\nCapt Moorhouse added: \u2018The Americans are genuinely impressed by the capability that we offer with Queen Elizabeth and they realise that they have got a genuine partner in the carrier game.\u2019"}}
