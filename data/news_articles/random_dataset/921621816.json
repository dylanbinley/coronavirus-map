Enough is enough: the Scottish government must follow the science.\u201d\n\nLast week the First Minister announced an expansion of testing, ultimately aiming for capacity to increase to 12,000 tests per day.\n\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \u201cThe learning points from Exercise Silver Swan were circulated to all health boards, local authorities and regional resilience partnerships to be incorporated into ongoing planning for situations such as this.\n\n\u201cWe do not routinely publish planning documentation related to exercises as they deal with a wide range of scenarios.\u201d"}}
