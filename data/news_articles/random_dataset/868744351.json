He only stated that chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray had reached a consensus on seat sharing and that would be final. He acknowledged he was \u201ctoo young\u201d to speak on seat sharing arrangement between the two parties.In an interaction with the media, the junior Thackeray said he came here for seeking people\u2019s blessings to make state free of drought, pollution, unemployment, farmers and women\u2019s problems. \u201cI will professionally answer all political queries on whether to fight elections or not when I will come for political campaigning. Ultimately, the people will decide on whether to entrust this responsibility to me or not,\u201d he said while hinting at he may contest the polls.He said BJP and Sena were on the same page on Hindutva agenda apart from other important issues like farmers\u2019 suicides and Ram temple in Ayodhya . \u201cWe were demanding removal of Article 370 for two years and have fully supported NDA government in this move.\u201dThackeray reiterated his party\u2019s opposition to formation of Vidarbha state, when asked on whether the central government would fulfil long pending demand of the people here, particularly after of Jammu and Kashmir was made a Union Territory. \u201cKashmir is an altogether different issue and the government\u2019s move to abrogate Article 370 was taken with an eye on Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.\u201dOn allegations of extortion against some Sena leaders, Thackeray stated the party would take strict action on complaints against such people. Taking a dig at opposition (Congress-NCP), he said they would nowhere be visible and no one knows what they are doing. \u201cIf they\u2019re here they should have raised issues concerning women, farmers, unemployment, and students.\u201dSpeaking on his Jan Ashirwad Yatra, Thackeray said he would tour entire Vidarbha and Marathwada in the third phase and meet all stakeholders including women, farmers and students. \u201cFor us, social work is 80% and politics is 20%. We don\u2019t discriminate on the basis of caste, creed and religion. We will try to fulfil responsibilities given to us by those who voted for us in the Lok Sabha polls and also for those who didn\u2019t vote for us,\u201d he said."}}
