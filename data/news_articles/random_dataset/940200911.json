Echanis\u2019 widow, Erlinda Echanis, who had identified her husband\u2019s body denounced the police action.\n\nBut the police said an identification card recovered at an apartment where the man she claimed to be her husband was found dead identified him as Manuel Santiago. Lt. Johanna Sazon, spokesperson for the Quezon City Police District, told the Inquirer on Tuesday that the family needed to prove that the slain man was Echanis by submitting fingerprints or DNA test results.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe need proof,\u201d Sazon told the Inquirer. Echanis\u2019 widow condemned the \u201cpersistent harassment\u201d by the police and \u201ctheir brazen act of snatching the remains\u201d of her husband. \u201cThis adds insult to our injury.\n\nIt is both inhuman and unjust for the remains of my husband to be held under police custody and deprive us of having a proper and private mourning,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhy is my husband\u2019s cadaver under investigation in the first place? It should be the perpetrators that should be hunted down and persecuted, not the lifeless body of my husband,\u201d said Erlinda. \u201cPlease give us a chance to grieve together around his body.\u201d She also called on President Duterte to intervene.\n\nEchanis, 71, and his neighbor Louie Tagapia were found dead inside his apartment in Novaliches, Quezon City, early on Monday. The police brought their bodies to Pink Petals Memorial Homes in La Loma.\n\nAfter identifying Echanis\u2019 body, his widow had it transferred to St. Peter\u2019s Memorial Chapel on Commonwealth Avenue. But the police on Monday night \u201cforcibly seized\u201d his remains and returned them to Pink Petals, said Luchi Perez, a lawyer for the Echanis family.\n\n\u201cThe widow of Ka Randy protested and told them that they cannot take away his body. However, despite her protest, the police proceeded to seize the lifeless body of Ka Randy and brought it to your funeral parlor,\u201d Perez said in a letter to Pink Petals demanding that they turn over Echanis\u2019 remains to his family.\n\nCiting Article 306 of the Civil Code and the Family Code, Perez said Echanis\u2019 wife had the right and the duty to make the funeral arrangements. \u201cThe PNP has no right to interfere with such right!\u201d Perez said in her letter to Pink Petals. The funeral parlor staff said that despite the identification of Echanis\u2019 body by his family, they would keep custody of his remains in accordance with instructions from the police who showed the Santiago ID.\n\n\u201cThere is dubious legal basis for this absurd and outrageous move. It is inhuman and abhorrent to morals and our culture. It is criminal,\u201d said Edre Olalia, the president of the National Union of Peoples\u2019 Lawyers who also acted as a legal consultant for the NDFP during the peace talks with the Duterte government.\n\nChel Diokno, chair of the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG), said the action by the police was \u201ca cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment defined as torture by law\u201d and that they had no legal or moral justification \u201cfor the indignity inflicted on the grieving family and friends of Echanis.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cEchanis and Tagapia deserve justice. The first step toward that is uncovering the truth. The brazen misconduct of the QC Police obscures that truth,\u201d Diokno said. The Pink Petals staff said Tagapia\u2019s body was autopsied on Monday night. That same night, a private doctor chosen by the family conducted a physical examination of Echanis\u2019 body and found two gunshot wounds in the back of his head in addition to stab wounds, Perez said.\n\nAn autopsy to be conducted by Dr. Rachel Fortun, a forensic pathologist chosen by the family, was scheduled for Wednesday. In addition to refusing to release Echanis\u2019 body, the police also charged one of two paralegal volunteers who were assisting his family with \u201cobstruction of justice.\u201d\n\nPaolo Colabres, who was watching over the remains of Echanis, said he merely asked the police why they were returning Echanis\u2019 body to Pink Petals. \u201cWe did not block the vehicle, did not harass the policemen,\u201d he told the Inquirer in a phone interview. He and the other paralegal followed the police back to the funeral house where he was later accosted by officers who \u201ccarried\u201d him to a police vehicle.\n\n\u201cThey said they needed to bring me to La Loma Police Station for verification and clarification,\u201d said Colabres. Minutes later a certain Police Lt. Ronaldo Ambatang read him his rights and brought him to the Criminal Investigation and Detection Unit at the Quezon City Police District Headquarters in Camp Karingal. \u201cPersonally, if they thought there was an obstruction of justice, for us there was a miscarriage of justice,\u201d said Colabres.\n\nRachel Pastores, one of Echanis\u2019 lawyers, said the charge against Colabres was \u201cridiculous since they were able to get possession of Randy Echanis\u2019 body.\u201d Former Anakpawis Rep. Ariel Casilao said that Colabres\u2019 arrest happened while their quick reaction team was negotiating with the police for the release of remains of Echanis, who was head of the party list group.\n\n\u201cThe police are the ones obstructing the justice for Ka Randy. Instead of going after the perpetrators, they fixate themselves to the families and a lifeless body attempting to cover up the crime,\u201d said Casilao, adding that this strengthened their suspicion that the state forces were behind Echanis\u2019 murder. Sazon dismissed suspicions that the police were involved in the killing.\n\n\u201cAs of now the motives we are looking are it\u2019s either \u2018akyat-bahay\u2019 or personal grudge,\u201d she said. PNP chief Police Gen. Archie Gamboa, she said, had already ordered a \u201cspeedy\u201d probe of the killing. Interior Secretary Eduardo A\u00f1o told reporters that he had ordered an investigation \u201cto identify the perpetrators.\u201d\n\nButch Olano, Amnesty International Philippines section director, lamented that killings \u201ccontinue unabated even in the midst of a deadly pandemic.\u201d\n\nHe said Echanis\u2019 death was \u201canother addition to the intensifying attacks against political activists in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cPublic safety and respect for human life and human rights has been cast aside since the beginning of this administration. This legacy of death must end now,\u201d Olano said. The human rights group Karapatan called Echanis\u2019 killing as \u201ccold-blooded and unpardonable extra-judicial execution\u201d and considered his death as \u201cthe latest in a long list of atrocities and loathsome attacks on peace and peasant advocates under this fascist regime.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are enraged beyond measure,\u201d said Karapatan chair Elisa Tita Lubi. \u201cHow can we achieve genuine and comprehensive social and economic reforms, as well as just and lasting peace, if advocates like Randy Echanis are being vilified, threatened and traitorously silenced?\u201d\n\nSen. Francis Pangilinan also condemned \u201cthe savage murder\u201d of Echanis and Tagapia and called on the police to respect the dead and to give the body of the peace consultant back to his family. He urged the National Bureau of Investigation to step in and make sure there would be a fair and impartial probe.\n\nJustice Secretary Menardo Guevarra ordered the NBI to confirm the identity of the Echanis before the Department of Justice (DOJ) conducted a special investigation of the killing. The DOJ leads the interagency task force on extrajudicial killings created by former President Benigno Aquino III in 2012 through Administrative Order No. 25 series of 2012 (AO 35).\n\n\u201cIf it turns out that the victim was Echanis himself and the known circumstances indicated an extrajudicial killing case, then the AO 35 task force will be the primary investigator,\u201d Guevarra said on Tuesday.\n\n\u2014With reports from Nestor Corrales, Leila B.
