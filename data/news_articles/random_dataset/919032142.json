MBS has denied ordering the killing but said he bore ultimate responsibility as the kingdom\u2019s de facto leader.\n\nOn Sunday, internet users in Turkey trying to access the sites of Saudi news agency SPA, the UAE's WAM news agency and more than a dozen other sites saw a message saying that they were blocked under a law governing internet publications in Turkey.\n\nA spokesman at Turkey's Justice Ministry declined to comment on the actions and the Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nThe Turkish website of the UK-based Independent newspaper, which is operated by a Saudi company, was one of the sites blocked, in a move its editor said reflected political tensions between Saudi Arabia and Turkey.\n\n\"We believe the tensions between Saudi Arabia and Turkey reflected on us,\" editor Nevzat Cicek told Reuters. Sunday's decision appeared to be \"retaliation against Saudi Arabia\", he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia had blocked access to several Turkish media websites a week earlier, including state broadcaster TRT and the state-owned Anadolu agency. Residents in the United Arab Emirates, a close ally of Saudi Arabia, said the Turkish websites were accessible on Sunday."}}
