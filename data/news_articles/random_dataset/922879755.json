Mr. Vinay Mohan Kwatra at a meeting held at MoFA today and handed over a diplomatic note in this regard.\u201d\n\nNo further details were immediately available. There was no immediate response to the development from Indian officials.\n\nThe border row erupted months after Nepal was irked by the depiction of Kalapani as part of Uttarakhand in new Indian maps showing the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Nepal had sought talks to address the Kalapani issue but New Delhi rejected Kathmandu\u2019s protest, saying the new maps accurately depict Indian territory.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Gyawali said Nepal could not wait for the end of the Covid-19 crisis for holding boundary talks with India. Gyawali, who was summoned by the Parliament\u2019s international relations committee, also said Nepal will hold talks with China after sorting out the issue with India, The Kathmandu Post reported.\n\nThe parliamentary panel had summoned Gyawali to discuss the opening of the road to Lipulekh by the Indian government last week.\n\n\u201cNepal, India and China are yet to ascertain the tri-junction in Lipulekh. So after talks with India, we will hold talks with China as well,\u201d Gyawal told the committee.\n\n\u201cWe are ready for talks at any level with India \u2013 at the prime minister\u2019s level or foreign secretary-level,\u201d he added.\n\nOn Saturday, Nepal had expressed regret at the inauguration of the route from Dharchula in Uttarakhand to Lipulekh, with the foreign ministry contending the road \u201cpasses through Nepali territory\u201d.\n\nDefence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the 80-km road on Friday to curtail the time taken for the pilgrimage to Kailash-Mansarovar. The road ends at Lipulekh Pass, and will help pilgrims avoid dangerous high-altitude routes through Sikkim and Nepal.\n\n\u201cThe recently inaugurated road section in Pithoragarh district in the state of Uttarakhand lies completely within the territory of India. The road follows the pre-existing route used by the pilgrims of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra,\u201d external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said.\n\nIndia and Nepal have an established mechanism for boundary issues, and the delineation of the border with Nepal is ongoing, Srivastava said. India is also committed to resolving outstanding boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue, he said.\n\nNepal\u2019s foreign ministry had sought talks between the foreign secretaries and Srivastava had said the two side are in the process of scheduling these talks, which would be held after they have dealt with the Covid-19 crisis."}}
