It\u2019s ongoing work, and you\u2019re going to have someone to continuously drive this. People who have not experienced being excluded have no idea,\u201d Jackson said.\n\n\u201cThe roots are so deep in the soil. This is why it\u2019s going to be a long time for change. That\u2019s going to come from generations and generations of finally having more opportunity, equal access, more consideration. You\u2019re trying to move that tree: It\u2019s going to take a long time,\u201d Jackson added.\n\nThe panel was formed in response to the 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. that turned violent, killing one and injuring at least 26 when a car ran into a crowd of peaceful protesters.\n\nCommon Councilman Eugene Nocera, who sits on the Human Relations Commission, said change is going to take \u201ca tremendous amount of work.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all concerned about not just the political forces in our country, but society in general. The events seem to become more commonplace,\u201d he said.\n\nIn September 2017, the council established a committee to renew its commitment to justice, equality and anti-discrimination, Nocera said. \u201cIt was the right time to take that stand in the face of some of the events occurring in our state and in our country.\u201d\n\nPeople of color are not treated equally in the workplace, said Jackson, who said she has experienced just that in her role in City Hall. \u201cIt\u2019s the systems that have been set up \u2014 whether intentional or by design, or by osmosis, not to be inclusive,\u201d she said.\n\nShe gives the example of an ant colony: \u201cThey\u2019re very busy \u2026 and they get things done. But if you\u2019ve never been able to work together as a group, but separate, how are you going to be included when the system is set up to exclude you?\u201d\n\nWhen Jackson was first hired as a director, she felt she was given fewer resources than her white counterparts.\n\n\u201cMy introduction to City Hall was not appropriate for the city hiring a director,\u201d said Jackson, who came to her position after working for years at Travelers and the University of Connecticut. \u201cNo matter what the color of your skin is, if you\u2019re a director, you\u2019re given the same tools and same setting as directors across the board,\u201d\n\nJackson was promised she\u2019d eventually get the technology she needed, but had no staff to assist. \u201cWho hires a director without a support person?\u201d It was a long time before she felt fully equipped to do her job.\n\n\u201cThe environment dictates how welcoming or not welcoming you are to anybody coming into a workplace. If you\u2019re working around diverse people, it would not be an issue,\u201d said Jackson, who believes naivety is part of the problem.\n\nJustin Carbonella, youth services coordinator for Middletown\u2019s Youth Services Bureau, and chairman of the Human Resources Commission, is pleased city leadership confronted the issue head-on.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the biggest steps a community can do: Don\u2019t pretend everything is OK. We take the time to be thoughtful and engage folks who have been marginalized,\u201d Carbonella said.\n\nIt\u2019s far from easy work \u2014 and involves a certain level of discomfort, he said.\n\n\u201cThere are people in this community who are living with that every day. We have to share that burden to understand that burden to alleviate that burden. That\u2019s what makes us work hard,\u201d he said.\n\nRecently, the city held two-day anti-racism training, mandatory for city employees. Representatives from Liberty Bank, the Middlesex Chamber of Commerce, Middlesex Health, the Russell Library and other organizations were invited to share their thoughts and experiences.\n\nThe idea was that education would create a ripple effect in the community, Jackson said.\n\n\u201cIt was quite an experience and eye-opening for a lot of the directors \u2014 how things really are when they don\u2019t think they are. Inequity happens every day in our jobs and we don\u2019t realize it,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019re on a journey to see how we can make these changes and be more inclusive, more aware, more conscious.\u201d\n\nCarbonella is particularly focused on inviting youth as young as 12 to participate in discussions. \u201cThese are issues we know young people in our community care about. They want to have these conversations. They want to be a generation working on this and working on this now.\n\n\u201cSometimes adults have a propensity to protect kids from bad things, and shield them from them. We don\u2019t think they understand or they\u2019re too young to get it, or they\u2019re too young to care,\u201d Carbonella said.\n\nPrecious Price, director of the Middletown Racial Justice Coalition, also sits on the commission and said she believes inequality exists throughout many sectors of society.\n\n\u201cFolks in Middletown believe there aren\u2019t a lot of opportunities as far as jobs here, and particularly within high leadership positions, which are typically white in Middletown,\u201d Price said.\n\nShe is also concerned at the lack of parity in punishments for youth of different races.\n\n\u201cA lot of the data tells you black and brown kids are disciplined at much higher rates than our white students,\u201d Price said. She also believes the hiring of teachers is \u201cvery much skewed to whites as far as who looks like who in the schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a community really committed to justice and equity. But you earn your wings every day. You can never stand on your past record,\u201d Nocera said. \u201cYou have to keep proving to yourself the commitment is still there and continues to be important in all we do.\u201d"}}
