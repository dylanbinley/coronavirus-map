Some of the issues centered on how far to extend epxnaded sick leave for workers affected by the virus. President Donald Trump had suggested the Senate alter it to allow expanded sick leave for workers at large corporations, raising the possibility of changes requiring the OK of both chambers at a time when the House is on a weeklong break from D.C.T\n\n\u201cWe want it for everybody,\u201d Trump said of the sick leave provisions. The Senate is working to \u201cenhance it and make it better and make it fair for everybody, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to do.\u201d\n\nIt was not immediately clear how those hurdles had been cleared.\n\nThe House-passed legislation includes enhanced jobless benefits, increased food aid for children, senior citizens and food banks, and higher funding for Medicaid benefits, as well as a temporary mandate for companies with fewer than 500 workers to give employees paid sick and family leave.\n\nCongressional leaders worked through snags over some language in the bill and objections raised by a few Republicans.\n\nAs Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell entered the Capitol earlier in the day, he said the chamber would take up the bill \u201cas quickly as we can get consent,\u201d suggesting a push to get Republicans on board for a vote this week.\n\nWeak and Unacceptable\n\nAlthough Trump had publicly backed the legislation and urged Congress to quickly pass it, the exemptions in the sick leave provision have drawn criticism from some Republicans, as well as labor groups.\n\nRepublican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said on Fox News Monday that the House-passed bill \u201cdoesn\u2019t go far enough and it doesn\u2019t go fast enough,\u201d adding that he\u2019s spoken to a lot of other senators who agree.\n\nOn the other end of the political spectrum, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union blasted the bill as \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d because it would exempt big corporations who employ about 80% of the workforce.\n\nThe legislation was already held up in the House Monday by delays in some technical corrections to the bill, which was written hastily Friday and passed after midnight following three days of negotiations between Mnuchin and Pelosi.\n\nEarlier Monday, Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert threatened to object to changes in the House bill, saying the legislation wasn\u2019t released with enough time for lawmakers to study the text. Gohmert could stop the House from approving the technical changes this week because the chamber needs unanimous support to pass legislation when lawmakers aren\u2019t in Washington, and House members left town Saturday.\n\nSmall Businesses\n\nMnuchin said Sunday that the administration is trying to allay concerns about the legislation, which is aimed at blunting some of the economic impact for workers and families as the coronavirus outbreak spreads in the U.S. In addition to being on Capitol Hill Monday, Senate Republicans invited Mnuchin to speak at their Tuesday lunch, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cWe are hearing feedback that certain small businesses are concerned about the burden of this. We were very focused, we need to get the money to people quickly,\u201d Mnuchin said on the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d program. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them to have to deal with big bureaucracy.\u201d"}}
