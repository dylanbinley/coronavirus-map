At the moment, this is just precautionary so there\u2019s no issue at all with our NHS services or capacity.\n\nDr Catherine Calderwood, Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer (Scottish Government/PA)\n\n\u201cIf this does spread throughout Scotland, it will become business as usual. It will become as we have with people with the flu that yes, some people are very ill, some people are less ill, we accept that and people get on with their normal business.\u201d\n\nThe first Scottish case was confirmed on Sunday as the UK total rose to 36, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson preparing to chair an emergency Cobra meeting on the outbreak.\n\nHowever, he was criticised for waiting until Monday to do so, with around another dozen confirmed cases in England over the weekend.\n\nThe Scottish Government said that clinicians had begun tracing the person\u2019s contacts, gathering details of the places they have visited and the people they have been in contact with since returning to the UK.\n\nClose contact involved face-to-face contact or spending more than 15 minutes within two metres of an infected person, rather than simply passing in a street or a shop.\n\nChaired a meeting of @scotgov Resilience Committee tonight to ensure all necessary steps being taken. Confirmation of a positive case is not unexpected and we are likely to see more in days ahead. Preparations to deal with what might be a significant outbreak are well advanced. https://t.co/uP6FMZv4cs \u2014 Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) March 1, 2020\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon chaired a meeting of the Scottish Government\u2019s Resilience Committee on Sunday, saying confirmation of a positive case was \u201cnot unexpected and we are likely to see more in days ahead\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cOur first thoughts must be with the patient diagnosed with coronavirus, I wish them a speedy recovery.\n\n\u201cScotland is well-prepared for a significant outbreak of coronavirus but there is currently no treatment or vaccine. Early detection measures will continue to be vital in helping to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cPeople have a vital role to play in helping us contain any outbreak by following the latest health and travel advice, and following basic hygiene precautions, such as washing hands frequently, not touching their face and covering their nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.\u201d"}}
