To this end, Yusuf noted that it would be impossible to expect revenue from the sector.\n\nWhile stressing that unless the Federal Government made deliberate effort to position non-oil sector to play a more prominent role in the economy, the situation will be worse.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cRight now we are on lockdown; the tempo of port business is still low. Before we will appreciate the gaps and the challenges in the economy, it will be after the lockdown.\n\n\u201cThat is when you now know about the challenges we have about foreign exchange, when people now say they want to import, you now appreciate the challenges better and how serious the situation is and you now begin to look at how we can adjust.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that, if we do not fix our none oil sector particularly by removing all these bottlenecks around logistics, around regulations; then this economy will be in bigger trouble because nothing is coming from oil any more.\n\nThe salvation is now in none oil sector and unless you remove all these bottom necks, the entire economy will just be grounded. So that is why what the shippers\u2019 council is doing is important, removing bottle necks and making the system more efficient,\u201d he noted.\n\nVanguard\n\nKindly Share This Story:"}}
