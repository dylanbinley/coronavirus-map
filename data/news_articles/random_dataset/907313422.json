We will turn challenges into opportunities,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile the outbreak is highly challenging, new industries have also emerged in the process.\u201d\n\nAt a press conference after emergency talks with the foreign ministers of the 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), Wang said he and his counterparts had agreed to strengthen cooperation to combat the epidemic.\n\nWang pledged that Beijing would share timely information on the epidemic, and said governments would explore setting up a China-Asean liaison mechanism to promote faster responses.\n\nThe Asean bloc is China\u2019s second largest trading partner after the European Union and travel restrictions introduced by some of its members have stalled projects under Beijing\u2019s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative to boost global trade and connectivity.\n\n\u00a9 AFP China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi says Beijing will share timely information on the coronavirus epidemic with Asean governments.

Japan, Singapore and South Korea have the highest number of cases outside mainland China.\n\nMore than 50 countries and territories have imposed travel bans and visa restrictions on China, with a slew of airlines also suspending flights. The United States, Australia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines have closed their borders to foreign travellers arriving from mainland China and urged their citizens not to travel there, with Philippine Airlines also cancelling flights there.\n\nMalaysia has banned travellers from Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, and this week said it would temporarily block international cruise ships that had departed or transited from any ports in China.\n\nVietnam has closed its land border with China. Thailand has not placed any travel restrictions on mainland Chinese tourists, a move that has sparked internal debates within its Cabinet. On Thursday it issued a travel advisory urging citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China.\n\nIn 2018, there were nearly 4,500 flights between China and Asean countries every week, with the number of mutual visits reaching 57 million.\n\n\u00a9 EPA-EFE Mask-clad tourists visit the Grand Palace in Bangkok on February 1, 2020.

Reuters reported that Wang told Balakrishnan that Beijing was worried about Singapore\u2019s \u201crestrictive measures\u201d.\u201cNow that the epidemic has eased and the situation is under control, we hope that normal exchanges between the two countries can be resumed as soon as possible,\u201d Wang told Balakrishnan.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters Catholics attend a mass wearing protective masks at a church in Manila on February 5, 2020. Photo: Reuters\n\nLocsin, speaking at the start of the 90-minute long meeting on Thursday said apart from the health impacts of the Covid-19 disease, the outbreak had been \u201cmassively detrimental\u201d to trade, travel, and the global economy.\n\nWhile acknowledging China\u2019s handling of the virus was \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cquick\u201d, the Philippine minister stressed the need for collective efforts, saying that states hoped to work towards a \u201cconsolidated response\u201d.\n\n\u201cEnemies such as Covid-19 demand action, compassion, and cooperation,\u201d Locsin said. \u201cStrengthening cooperation can help pave the way to subduing this enemy.\u201d\n\nAfter the meeting, Locsin told the South China Morning Post that the Chinese government had taken \u201ccompletely rational\u201d steps to contain the disease, and the conference was \u201cbasically to say thank you\u201d to Beijing.\n\nApart from the broader initiatives mentioned by Wang, including a possible gathering of health ministers later this year, Locsin said day-to-day gestures showing solidarity with China were more important. \u201cLittle gestures, such as when we took our people out of Wuhan back, we brought goods to China,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did not have much but that\u2019ll never be forgotten. People remember that.\u201d\n\nHe echoed Wang\u2019s point that it was important to strengthen people-to-people relations. He said one example of this was how he had lifted a travel ban so Filipinos working in Hong Kong could return to work.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters Philippines' Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jnr Photo: Reuters\n\nLocsin also felt the coronavirus had not affected ties between China and Asean.\n\n\u201cWhat it has done is show that there are some things that are really beyond politics,\u201d he said, adding that it would be \u201csickening\u201d if people used the virus for political leverage.\n\n\u201cThose who weaponise the [virus] for their geopolitical ends \u2026 they will be sorry,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added, however, that there were ongoing issues in the China-Asean relationship, such as long-standing territorial disputes in the South China Sea.\n\n\u201c[Issues] will be there but I think on both sides, they will see that these issues that are dividing us are not really worth as much as we can gain from plain, old friendship.\u201d\n\nSome analysts said the China-Asean meeting was partly a public relations exercise.\n\nDylan Loh, assistant professor of social sciences at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said the meeting could \u201cbe seen as a legitimacy building exercise where external actors take turns to vindicate and praise Chinese efforts in fighting the coronavirus\u201d.\n\nHe said all member states were heavily dependent on China for trade, and in turn, Beijing expected political and diplomatic support for its virus containment efforts.\n\n\u201cIt is of no surprise then, that Beijing has found succour in Southeast Asia, with countries in the region offering material, moral and rhetorical support even as these countries themselves have enacted travel restrictions of various kinds,\u201d he said.\n\nLoh said that besides hoping that formal travel restrictions on mainland Chinese travellers would ease, Beijing also hoped that governments of Southeast Asia would do more symbolically and rhetorically in shoring up confidence in Chinese efforts to contain the virus \u2013 particularly to their business communities.\n\n\u201cAsean countries are, of course, genuinely hoping that the impact of the virus is short, and that China will win the battle against the disease because they themselves stand to lose a lot from the fallout. In that way, the emphasis on resuming people-to-people relations is an attempt to normalise and de-stigmatise Chinese business, tourists and citizens,\u201d he said.\n\nBenjamin Ho, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies\u2019 China programme in Singapore, said the meeting was \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d to \u201cproject a favourable image of China given all the negative news we have seen the past month\u201d.\n\n\u201cMost of the hardest hit countries this time are countries that have close ties with China [such as] Japan, South Korea, Singapore, as well as Asean more broadly. For people-to-people ties to resume, it is important for China to return to normalcy,\u201d he said.\n\nZi Yang, a senior analyst who is in the same China programme as Ho, said the meeting gave China an opportunity to project confidence to the world, adding that it was in the interest of both parties to see the end of the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\n\u201cThe central message from the China-Asean meeting today is unity in facing adversity and their desire to move forward together in containing Covid-19,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Chinese economy, already under pressure, desperately needs a return to normalcy. Trade, investment, and travel flows must resume to previous levels as soon as possible, or else the Chinese government could face further uncertainty and instability.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the coronavirus also dominated the fifth Mekong-Lancang Cooperation meeting, a Beijing-backed project with five Asean countries: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.\n\nWang said that a shared response towards Covid-19 was one of the areas that partner nations needed to work on as the initiative moves from what he called a stage of \u201crapid expansion\u201d to one of \u201ccomprehensive development\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will also, from a longer-term perspective, discuss the establishment of a joint response mechanism to major public health emergencies and commit ourselves to enhance the medical and healthcare service for people in this region,\u201d said Wang at a joint press conference.\n\nOther areas of further collaboration ranged from enhancing trade connectivity between partner nations as well as looking at how to tackle increased droughts in the Mekong region.\n\nWang said China had increased the water outflow of the Lancang River to help Mekong countries mitigate the drought, adding that Beijing would consider sharing hydrological data with partner nations.\n\nMore Articles from SCMP\n\nLenovo to boost production overseas as coronavirus crisis slows down China manufacturing\n\nCoronavirus: Chinese toilet paper makers say there\u2019s \u2018plenty of stock\u2019 after panic buying in Hong Kong\n\nChina wasn\u2019t original villain in book \u2018predicting\u2019 coronavirus outbreak \u2013 it was Russia\n\nNo Chinese should be surprised by coronavirus-inspired racism\n\nHong Kong authorities seize tonnes of American ginseng bound for mainland China in biggest bust for a decade\n\nThis article originally appeared on the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the leading news media reporting on China and Asia.
