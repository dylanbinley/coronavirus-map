However, neither made any new commitments at the UN climate summit.\n\nI think apathy has been impeding the progress of climate action, and has led to the passive stance of world leaders.\n\nSingapore will be affected greatly by the detrimental effects of climate change. Rising sea levels may overwhelm low-lying coastal areas. Rises in temperature may affect the biological diversity in Singapore.\n\nIt is imperative for us to adopt an active stand on this matter. Only if everyone puts aside his passivity can we avert a climate catastrophe brought on by our own misdeeds.\n\nRoman Sage Tan, 14\n\nSecondary 2 student\n\nCALLING YOUNG READERS: If you are a student or aged 21 years or below, and want to air your opinion on any report or letter in The Straits Times, e-mail your letter to stforum@sph.com.sg, with the subject header \u201cVoices of Youth\u201d.
