Their follow up, \u201cDaybreakers,\u201d starred Ethan Hawke and was a hit at that year\u2019s Midnight Madness in Toronto, before again enjoying a theatrical run again handled by Lionsgate.\n\nSince then the two have found continued success with features such as \u201cPredestination\u201d \u2013 once again with Hawke in the leading role, \u201cJigsaw\u201d and last year\u2019s \u201cWinchester,\u201d starting Helen Mirren.\n\nGolden\u2019s New York Times best-selling franchise began in 2017 with \u201cArarat,\u201d and starred Ben Walker, a self-described \u201cweird s**t expert\u201d who works for the Department of Defense investigating strange phenomena.\n\nThe second book, \u201cThe Pandora Room,\u201d hit shelves earlier this year, with \u201cRed Hands\u201d to follow in 2020. Golden, who worked on the screenplay for last year\u2019s \u201cHellboy\u201d reboot, is writing the pilot\n\n\u201cThe Spierigs approach to this material will bring to the \u2018Ben Walker\u2019 television series the same dynamism and thrills they\u2019ve brought to their theatrical features,\u201d said Diaz in a statement. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to see the world of Ben Walker through their eyes in what promises to be a thrilling action-packed television series.\u201d\n\nJust part of a fast-growing slate, wit an important line in not only high-end scripted but also non-fiction, AGC Television is currently producing a contemporary \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d series, created by London-based Urban Myth, and starring Gabriel Byrne and Elizabeth McGovern in production with Studiocanal and Fox Network Groups. Canal Plus and Fox have Europe and Africa rights. AGC is taking the show out in North America and co-distributing with Studiocanal in Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East. Fox is selling it in Europe."}}
