In return, Jordan agreed to return its ambassador to Tel Aviv after he had been recalled for consultations.\n\nKing Abdullah, under internal political pressure, had given a year\u2019s notice of his intention not to renew the special arrangement giving Israelis free access to the lands.\n\nOn Sunday, the Jordanian Army raised the country\u2019s flag in Baqura, a pocket of land some 10 miles south of the Sea of Galilee, sandwiched between the Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers. In Hebrew, it is known as \u201cthe Island of Peace.\u201d\n\nRecognizing Israeli private property rights there, Jordanian officials said Israeli farmers would be allowed continued access to the lands if they applied for visas through the Jordanian Embassy in Tel Aviv and passed through official border crossings.\n\nIsraelis in the area said such an arrangement was impractical, and they cast the handover of the land to full Jordanian control as a diplomatic failure.\n\n\u201cThere is a feeling of frustration and disappointment,\u201d said Eli Arazi, a member of a nearby kibbutz, or communal farm, who sat on the negotiating team for the 1994 agreement and on the committee that was set up to oversee the special arrangement."}}
