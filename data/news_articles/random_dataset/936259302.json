Three years later the pair of biology professors \u2014 notably memorialized today in the name of the local Sperry-Galligar Audubon Society \u2014 bought a one-acre lot on South College Street and named it \"Paradocs.\"\n\n\"I had an Ecological Idea,\" Sperry said in opening a 1960 address, titled \"An Ecological Paradox,\" to the Kansas Academy of Science.\n\n\"Its general description is that of a wild area, within the encompassment of a western civilization,\" he said.\n\nThough Dr. Sperry retired from PSU in 1974, he remained an active retiree until his death in 1995, at which time he left his one-acre Paradocs property at 1413 S. College St. to PSU.\n\n\"We\u2019re one of the neighbors and we observe that area quite often,\" said Tamara Crowell, who remains involved in the Sperry-Galligar Audubon Society \u2014 though not as closely as she was when she used to frequently attend its meetings with her husband.\n\n\"But we don\u2019t actually walk in that area because we assume that Pitt State would want to be in charge of what\u2019s going on there, since Dr. Sperry thought the best thing to do was to leave it to PSU so the students could observe a little wildlife right here in the city.\"\n\nThough the Sperry home and Paradocs property were left to PSU with an endowment to maintain the space, however, that money has since run out. For years, another \"pair of docs,\" PSU biology professors Steve and Cindy Ford, were instrumental in making sure the Sperry conservation area was put to its intended use and often visited by students. But the Fords retired in 2016, and the university has since struggled both to utilize and maintain the property.\n\nThe home on the property, which Sperry called Lyrrose (lear\u2019rose), could use some updating, but the university has made improvements, including putting a new roof on the building in recent years. Officials have noted that Sperry\u2019s intent for the property was for it to be maintained in a natural state with a minimum of interference from the human custodians, but even that comes with a price tag.\n\nAs the coronavirus crisis has impacted university budgets nationwide, the question of how to pay for maintaining the property has become more pressing.\n\nIf PSU decided to sell the Sperry home, Crowell said, it could impact the university\u2019s reputation as a responsible steward of property entrusted to it.\n\n\"I think more people in this area would be interested in leaving property to PSU,\" she said. \"In fact I\u2019ve thought about it myself. But you wouldn\u2019t want to leave it to PSU if they were just going to turn around and sell it. I think it should be a wildlife area and it should be open to PSU students. Let them study the wildlife. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot out there that students would enjoy seeing.\"\n\nThe university has explored ideas including turning the Sperry home into an event space or a museum, although the lack of parking space and the property\u2019s location in the middle of a residential area make those options somewhat impractical. PSU has also been looking into grant opportunities to support the facility."}}
