Kenneth McKenzie speaks to reporters at the Pentagon in Washington as a video of the raid that led to the killing of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is displayed, Oct. 30, 2019.\n\nThe United States and its allies will deliver \u201csustained and systematic pressure\u201d against the Islamic State, Washington\u2019s chief counter-terrorism coordinator said Friday, a day after the militant group confirmed the death of leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and named his successor.\n\nAmbassador Nathan Sales, the U.S. State Department\u2019s counter-terrorism coordinator, delivered this message as he unveiled the department\u2019s 2018 annual terrorism report, which underscored that the terror group has proven its ability to adapt by inspiring followers online and advancing its global presence.\n\n\u201cISIS remains our top national security priority. We\u2019re aware of the fact that it has selected a new leader,\u201d Sales told a news conference in Washington, using the other acronym for Islamic State (IS). \u201cWe will continue to subject that organization to unrelenting counter-terrorism pressure. \u2026 We will dismantle the group regardless of who its leadership cadre is.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, IS confirmed for the first time that al-Baghdadi was killed during an Oct. 26 raid by U.S. Special Forces in northwestern Syria. The group made the announcement on the messaging service Telegram, where it also identified its new leader as Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Quraishi.\n\nSales said the United States and its allies liberated about 7.7 million men, women and children from brutal IS rule when in March it smashed the militant group\u2019s so-called caliphate. It once controlled wide swaths of land covering an area as big as Great Britain in parts of Syria and Iraq.\n\nHe said hundreds of IS fighters were captured and detained by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a U.S. partner, but many of those battle-hardened terrorists, including Muslims from Southeast Asia, headed home from the war zone in Syria and Iraq or traveled to their home countries, posing new dangers. Sales did not provide figures.\n\n\u201cOver the last year, ISIS\u2019s global presence evolved with affiliates and networks conducting attacks in the Middle East, South and East Asia and Africa,\u201d Sales said.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s annual report underscored that Iran has remained the world\u2019s top sponsor of terrorism. The department accused Tehran of funneling almost U.S. $1 billion each year \u201cto support terrorist groups that serve as its proxies and expand its malign influence across the globe.\u201d\n\nThe report also highlighted Washington\u2019s anti-terror cooperation with Southeast Asian nations, citing numbers from Indonesia\u2019s attorney-general who said that the country had convicted 150 of 370 suspected terrorists arrested between May and December 2018.\n\nIndonesia, the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation, has faced a resurgence of recent extremist attacks in recent months.\n\nThree church bombings in Surabaya, capital of Indonesia\u2019s East Java province, on May 13 and one bomb blast at an apartment near the city and the attack at a police headquarters the following day claimed 27 lives, including 13 perpetrators, police said.\n\nThe attackers had ties to the local terror group JAD, which has IS links, according to investigators\n\nThe State Department\u2019s terrorism report said that the Philippines remained a top destination for IS-linked fighters from Indonesia and Malaysia, and a potential destination for those fleeing Syria and Iraq.\n\nLast year, the report said, Washington funded programs to counter radicalization. It did not provide figures.\n\nThe report said tactics and use of technologies used by IS and other terror groups evolved throughout 2018.\n\n\u201cFor example, the increased use of commercially available drones and encrypted communications, as well as low-tech vehicle and knife attacks, presented additional challenges for the international counter-terrorism community,\u201d it said."}}
