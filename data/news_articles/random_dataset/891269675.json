Here, he offered IOM\u2019s steady support to the Greek government through the continued provision of humanitarian services to migrants and refugees in need, the movement of vulnerable people from the islands and their accommodation on the mainland.\n\n\u201cThe transfer of migrants and refugees from overcrowded, very poor conditions on the islands to the Greek mainland is a humane and practical demonstration of solidarity within Greece itself,\u201d Vitorino said following the meeting.\n\n\u201cLikewise, Greece needs continued solidarity and support from fellow EU member states to share the responsibility and to buffer against any future shocks,\u201d he continued.\n\nIrregular migrant crossings to Greece have increased in the second half of this year, adding stress to already overburdened structures and communities, particularly on the islands.\n\nThe Director General stressed that a balanced approach to migration management will be more effective in the longer term.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that the dangers and the pressures of irregular migration facilitated by pervasive smuggling networks can be alleviated by improving and increasing channels for orderly and legal migration, including resettlement and complementary pathways and responsibility-sharing mechanism among EU member states,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be greater urgency in the ongoing discussions, but after today I\u2019m confident that migration management and cooperation will receive new impetus,\u201d he said.\n\nDG Vitorino also met with the Mayor of Athens, Kostas Bakoyannis. Together they visited the Elaionas open facility in the centre of Athens which currently hosts some 1,800 refugees and asylum seekers. Elaionas is one of the 30 long-term accommodation facilities active in the Greek mainland, where IOM ensures dignified reception and protection standards for some 24,000 migrants and refugees with the support of the European Commission.\n\nFor further information, please contact Christine Nikolaidou, IOM Greece, Tel: +30 210 99 19 040, Email: cnikolaidou@iom.int"}}
