Linda Greenstein, D-Middlesex, during a Trenton hearing Thursday.\n\nYet just a few hours later, she and other lawmakers on the Senate Labor Committee voted 3-1 in favor of legislation that critics say would take money out of the pockets of some freelance workers and put others out of business altogether. Greenstein said she hoped additional amendments would address their concerns.\n\nThe legislation codifies how the government determines whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor.\n\nSenate President Steve Sweeney, D-Gloucester, who sponsored the bill, said it was an attempt to prevent companies from misclassifying workers as independent contractors in order to pay lower wages and skirt employment taxes.\n\n\u201cMisclassification not only hurts workers. It hurts law-abiding businesses in the state,\u201d he said. \u201cThe businesses that don\u2019t play by the rules aren\u2019t paying into the unemployment fund or the disability fund, which raises the cost for workers in all other businesses.\u201d\n\nThe state recently charged the rideshare company Uber $650 million in unemployment and disability insurance taxes, after it determined the San Francisco-based firm had misclassified its drivers as independent contractors, according to Bloomberg.\n\nTo decide whether someone is an independent contractor, the state Department of Labor uses what is called an \u201cABC test.\u201d Lawmakers say they are simply putting that regulation into law so it cannot be changed by future administrations.\n\nBut freelance workers \u2014 including writers, truckers, and wedding photographers \u2014 said the current ABC test is flawed, and that cementing that regulatory language into law will make their employment situations even more precarious.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a problem. It\u2019s been a problem. It has to be changed,\u201d said Gary Cooper, an independent truck driver from Elizabeth.\n\nCooper said that many workers like him prefer the freedom of being self-employed and working on a contract basis with companies. But he said the wording of the bill \u2014 and the state regulation \u2014 was \u201ctoo loose\u201d and left open the possibility that the state could deem him an employee and not a freelancer, destroying his livelihood.\n\nThe state \u201ccould really come in and shut down\u201d the business relationship between companies and independent contractors, Cooper said, \u201cand that would affect us.\u201d\n\nThere are signs that New Jersey is clamping down on employee misclassification. In addition to the Uber assessment, a state task force created by Gov. Phil Murphy released a report in July calling worker misclassification a \u201cgrowing problem\u201d and outlining ways to fight it.\n\nOne of the main sticking points with the legislation appears to be the second prong of the ABC test, which requires an independent contractor to either do work outside the company\u2019s usual course of business or physically perform the contracted work outside the company\u2019s place of business.\n\nSome freelancers testified that they could not meet that requirement, and that the ABC test should be changed and not further codified into law. However, supporters of the legislation noted that these same workers have been collecting paychecks for years while the regulation has been in place.\n\nHow life would change for independent contractors under the law remains unclear.\n\nBut Kim Kavin, a freelance writer from Long Valley, said the hint of a law change has already done damage. She said publications have been turning away New Jersey-based writers out of fear that they would no longer be able to pay them as independent contractors and would instead have to hire them as actual employees.\n\n\u201cWe are already being blacklisted on threat of this legislation passing,\u201d Kavin said."}}
