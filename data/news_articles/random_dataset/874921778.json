He or she can deny installing it. Hence, we are examining the option of filing police complaints against unidentified persons.\u201d\n\nAccording to Goel, many of the leaders from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have refused to take ownership of these hoardings and say that they are unaware as to who had put these hoardings. Often the BJP leaders say that these hoardings were put by party workers.\n\nAccording to the information provided by the civic body\u2019s action report, of the 7,052 illegal hoardings, 1,356 hoardings were in Wanowrie, Ramtekadi, Hadapsar and Mundhwa areas. There were no illegal hoardings on Ahmednagar road, Wadgaonsheri, Shivajinagar and Sinhgad road areas.\n\nChief Minister Devendra Fadnavis\u2019 Mahajanadesh yatra entered Pune on September 14."}}
