A saleswoman said it had been rejected again because \u201cour senior management do not feel comfortable posting it,\u201d said one member of the group.\n\nRelated\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not allowing us to practice our freedom of speech,\u201d complained another of the activists, who asked to be identified only by his surname, Wong, citing the security law\u2019s apparently global reach. \u201cThis is scandalous.\u201d\n\nAfter submitting the advertisement to Sing Tao July 17 and having it rejected first on July 19, then again on July 21, the B.C. group took it to rival Ming Pao. That newspaper agreed to run the version of the statement that did not mention Choi or the NCCC, said Wong.\n\nThe incident adds to longstanding complaints that many of Canada\u2019s Chinese-language media outlets eschew negative content about China\u2019s Communist Party-led regime.\n\nBut a Sing Tao manager dismissed any suggestion his organization was trying to censor China critics.\n\nThe newspaper reviews all ad submissions for \u201clibelous contents, good taste and other legal issues,\u201d said Andrew Lai, general manager of Sing Tao Daily.\n\n\u201cAfter carefully reviewing the said advertisement (under) the anonymous name of \u2018a group of Canadian Hong Kongers,\u2019 we declined the said advertisement,\u201d he said.\n\nThe paper has not shied from reporting on both sides of the Hong Kong conflict, argued Lai. He cited a recent story on a protest by Canadians of Hong Kong background in Vancouver against Choi\u2019s support for the security law and his claim that he speaks for most Chinese Canadians.\n\nLai also pointed to three letters it printed on one day in June that criticized the initiative.\n\n\u201cSing Tao Daily\u2019s basic aim as a newspaper serving the Canadian Chinese community is to engage in the full and frank dissemination of news and opinion.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for human rights in China do not agree.\n\nBoth Sing Tao and Ming Pao have for the last ten years refused to run ads from the Toronto association for democracy in China to commemorate the 1989 Tienanmen Square massacre, said association spokesman Cheuk Kwan.\n\n\u201cThis rejection of an ad critical of Choi and the NCCC is par for the course,\u201d Kwan said. \u201cAnother case of Chinese (government) influence in our civic society and politics. In this case, media self-censorship by the Chinese-language media.\u201d\n\nHe charges that the Chinese embassy and consulates exert influence on ethnic media here either directly, through owners tied to Beijing, or via the leverage of advertising by China-friendly businesses.\n\nIn a high-profile 2009 episode, a senior Sing Tao editor altered a Toronto Star article on Tibet to remove criticism of China before publishing it in his own paper. The editor was eventually fired.\n\nThe National Congress itself has often appeared in line with Beijing. Last year, a congress leader echoed Beijing\u2019s calls for the federal government to drop extradition proceedings against Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei CFO. The NCCC has backed installing the Chinese government\u2019s controversial Confucius Institute at the Toronto public school board and allowing state-run CCTV onto Canadian cable. In 2003, the Chinese ambassador offered the congress \u201cour highest compliment\u201d for co-hosting an exhibit at Toronto City Hall that promoted China\u2019s narrative on Tibet.\n\nThere were no follow up questions from the journalist, it was very scripted\n\nOn a visit to Canada in 2007, Chinese diplomatic defector Chen Yonglin charged that the NCCC was in effect a front for the People\u2019s Republic, a charge the group strongly denied.\n\nChoi could not be reached for comment.\n\nBeijing says the national security law is designed to quell violent demonstrations and restore order in Hong Kong. But critics warn it will crush the limited freedoms that set the city apart from mainland China, criminalizing subversion of government power, support for separatism, collusion with foreign forces and using violence in protests.\n\nIn Canada, the alleged self-censorship by Chinese-language media seems to have worsened amid China\u2019s Hong Kong crackdown, said Cherie Wong of Alliance Canada Hong Kong.\n\nWong mentioned a recent, uncritical radio interview in Vancouver with Beijing\u2019s consul general there, in which the diplomat lambasted Chinese-Canadian critics of the security law.\n\n\u201cThere were no follow up questions from the journalist, it was very scripted,\u201d said Wong. \u201cWith the misleading news and this kind of misleading information circulating in ethnic media, our communities are at risk.\u201d\n\nThe B.C. activists say they plan to write to Torstar, which owns about 50 per cent of Sing Tao, to complain about the ad rejection."}}
