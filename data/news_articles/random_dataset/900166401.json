Mennonites who had emigrated to Canada and the U.S. tried to help them through the MCC.\n\nThe Committee then expanded to provide relief work around the world.\n\nSusan Peterson with the Ross Road Community Church in Abbotsford began quilting with her mother when she was a teenager. (Doug Kerr/CBC)\n\nThe Great Winter Warm Up event marked 100 years of parishioners gathering in halls and in basements across North American to take up needles, thread and pieces of fabric to make quilts. They are gifts to help keep people in need warm but also remind them that people care about them.\n\n\"Last year we watched a video of [people] receiving their blankets and they don't call them blankets they call them their Mennonites, 'we got our Mennonites,'\" said quilter Marlene Dirksen.\n\nThe quilts made in places like Abbotsford will be shipped to places like Haiti, Iraq, Serbia, and Zambia but also within Canada and the U.S. where there is need.\n\nIn 2019 the MCC sent more than 53,000 hand made comforters to people around the world.\n\nRon Ratzlaff with the Mennonite Central Committee got to hand some of those quilts out. He says it made him happy to see the faces of people receiving them.\n\n\"It thrills my heart because you see the joy and it keeps their children warm at night,\" he said."}}
