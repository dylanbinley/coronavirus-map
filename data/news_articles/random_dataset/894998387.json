Goble, 33, of Washington Township, New Jersey, died Dec. 23 as a result of injuries sustained in a roadside bombing in Kunduz Province, Afghanistan.\n\n(Tribune News Service) \u2014 A hero. The \u201cdefinition of a patriot.\u201d A \u201cgood dude.\u201d A New Jersey soldier who was killed in Afghanistan days before Christmas is remembered as being an exemplary man, soldier and father by friends, family and officials.\n\nSgt. 1st Class Michael J. Goble, 33, of Bergen County was killed Monday during combat in Afghanistan, military officials said. Goble, a Bronze Star recipient who was in Afghanistan supporting Operation Freedom's Sentinel, was assigned to 1st Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, the military said. Goble was on his final tour of duty when he was killed, set to come home in less than a month.\n\n\u201cWestwood and Washington Township lost another son, brother, father while fighting for the US military in Afghanistan,\u201d state Assemblywoman Holly Schepisi, R-Bergen, who represents Goble\u2019s hometown, said in a Facebook post. \u201cWhile most of us are sitting down to Christmas dinner trying not to argue about trivial things with relatives we haven\u2019t seen in a while, Sgt. Michael Goble\u2019s family will be meeting his body on the tarmac as he returns 3 weeks early from his fourth and final tour of duty.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban has claimed responsibility for his death, but a spokeswoman for US Army Special Operations Command said Tuesday the claim remains under investigation.\n\n\u201cRight now our hearts go out to the family and to the loved ones of Michael,\" Westwood Mayor John Birkner, Jr. said Tuesday. \u201cWe are a very very grateful community for his service to our country and to the values of freedom and democracy that we hold so dear.\n\n\"We went through this before back in 2010 we lost Marine Sgt. Christopher Hrbek to an attack in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nBirkner called Goble\u2019s death \"a tragedy that hits home. We see and we read newspaper headlines every day about the horrors of war. These really bring it right into our living rooms. These are our families. These are friends. These are our neighbors. It hits a little harder. It stings a little more. But the community is here for the family. There\u2019s no question about it.\u201d\n\nBirkner said he has reached out to the family to offer help in providing help to escort them to Delaware, where Goble\u2019s body was expected to arrive Tuesday, and back to New Jersey.\n\nFriends and fellow military members shared tributes to Goble, who they say \u201cpaid the ultimate price\u201d fighting for his country.\n\nLt. Gov. Sheila Oliver, who is New Jersey\u2019s acting governor while Gov. Phil Murphy is out of state, will order state and U.S. flags to fly at half-staff, the governor\u2019s office told NJ Advance Media on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cSgt. 1st Class Michael Goble represented the best values of our Armed Forces and of New Jersey \u2014 dedication, fearlessness, and excellence,\" Oliver and Murphy said in a joint statement.\n\nSupport from politicians and local officials came in from across the country, including a U.S. senator from Oklahoma, a presidential candidate, and the New Jersey State PBA.\n\nA GoFundMe established to benefit Goble\u2019s partner and young daughter has raised $23,000, eclipsing its original goal of $15,000. The goal has been bumped up to $50,000.\n\nGoble\u2019s military career included numerous overseas deployments, including Argentina, Guatemala, Colombia and South Korea. He also previously deployed to Afghanistan twice.\n\nGoble is the 20th soldier to be killed in Afghanistan this year, in addition to three noncombat deaths. More than 2,400 Americans have been killed since the war started nearly 18 years ago.\n\n\u00a92019 NJ Advance Media Group, Edison, N.J.\n\nVisit NJ Advance Media Group, Edison, N.J. at www.nj.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."}}
