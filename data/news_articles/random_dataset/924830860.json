Venezuelan officials paint them as a threat, but US officials have not announced any plans to intercept the Iranian tankers, or threatened to try.\n\nBoth Iran and Venezuela have been hit with US economic sanctions.\n\nVenezuelan Ambassador to the UN Samuel Moncada criticized the US, saying that any attempt to stop the tankers would be illegal.\n\n\u201cForbidding those boats from reaching their destination would thus constitute a crime against humanity,\u201d Moncada said at a UN Security Council meeting to discuss the turmoil in Venezuela.\n\nThe five Iranian tankers are expected to start arriving in Venezuela in the coming days. They are carrying gasoline to help alleviate days-long lines at service stations, even in Caracas, which had normally been immune to shortages as the capital and seat of political power.\n\nIranian Ambassador to Venezuela Hojjatollah Soltani earlier on Wednesday defended broadening trade relations between the two nations, which includes the five tankers, as their right to trade freely.\n\nInternational conventions protect the expanding ties between the two US-sanctioned nations, Soltani said.\n\n\u201cThis relationship between Iran and Venezuela does not threaten anybody. It is not a danger to anyone,\u201d Soltani said in a meeting with reporters at the Iranian embassy in Caracas.\n\nIn addition to sending the tankers, Iran has flown in shipments of a chemical needed to restart an aging Venezuelan oil refinery with the goal of producing gasoline.\n\nWhile Venezuela has the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, its oil production has plummeted in the past two decades, which critics blame on corruption and mismanagement under socialist rule.\n\nUS sanctions designed to force Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from power have also hurt production.\n\nThe US National Security Council on Monday wrote on Twitter that few financial lifelines remain for Maduro. The US is among nearly 60 nations that recognize Venezuelan National Assembly President Juan Guaido, the opposition leader, as the nation\u2019s legitimate leader.\n\n\u201cOur maximum pressure campaign, which includes financial & economic sanctions, will continue until Maduro\u2019s tyrannical hold ends,\u201d the council wrote. \u201cThe humanitarian & economic crisis endured by Venezuelans is the fault of 1 person \u2014 Maduro.\u201d\n\nFor Iran, the business ties with Venezuela represent a way to bring money into its cash-starved coffers and apply its own pressure on Washington.\n\nSoltani denied claims that Iranian planes returned from Venezuela loaded with gold to pay for Tehran\u2019s support.\n\nHe accused US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of spreading \u201cfake news\u201d to undermine the trade, which the ambassador called a \u201cwin-win\u201d for both Venezuela and Iran.\n\n\u201cThey can sanction whoever they want,\u201d Soltani said. \u201cIran will always advance.\u201d\n\nAdmiral Craig Faller, the top US military official in Latin America, on Monday said that he was \u201cconcerned\u201d by the news reports that Iran was shipping gasoline to Venezuela.\n\nHe said it fits a larger pattern of Iran trying to gain \u201cpositional advantage in our neighborhood in a way that would counter US interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen those same news reports that the tankers are in route,\u201d Faller said in a Webcast. \u201cWe see the long hand of that Iranian malfeasance at work each and every day.\u201d"}}
