You may have a third term campaign soon,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cVery soon, they will destroy all possible opponents. And by the time they bring in the third term agenda, the media would have been gone. But we are not going to allow it. No dictatorship can defeat the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nThe senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN) expressed dismay at the way Ijeoma Ojukwu, a judge of a federal high court in Abuja, is handling the case of Omoyele Sowore, convener of #RevolutionNow Movement.\n\n\u201cNobody has been given the kind of bail (condition) Sowore was given. All those who looted the treasury have never had their movement restricted. Sowore has been granted bail, but his movement has been restricted to Abuja. His family is in America,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe does not live in Abuja. He has no house in Abuja. Yet, he has been asked to stay in Abuja. The trial may last for 10 years, but he cannot leave Abuja. It has never happened in Nigeria before.\n\n\u201cSowore has been banned as a journalist from speaking. As a politician, he cannot address a rally until the case is determined. We don\u2019t know how long it will last.\u201d"}}
