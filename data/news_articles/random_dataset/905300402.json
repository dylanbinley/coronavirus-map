At the top of Friday night\u2019s presidential primary debate, Biden strikingly said that \u201cI took a hit in Iowa and I\u2019m probably going to take a hit here.\u201d\n\nAnd on Tuesday morning, Biden announced he would be heading south before the polls closed in the state that holds the first primary in the White House race so he could instead hold a kick-off rally in South Carolina, which votes later this month.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden\u2019s departure is seen as a sign that his prospects for a third-place finish in New Hampshire are fading. A strong finish in the Granite State was thought to be critical -- if only to prevent an exodus of donors and the possible erosion of his so-called \"firewall\" of support in the looming South Carolina contest.\n\nThe memo, written by Unite the Country treasurer Larry Rasky, argues that the \u201c[Bernie] Sanders-[Elizabeth] Warren wing of the Party is ready for the Bloomberg fight. Democrats cannot afford a split Convention.\u201d\n\nAnd the memo predicts that \u201cif Bernie has more delegates, do you really think the Bros will make way for Mike?\u201d (The \"Bros\" refers to hardcore Sanders supporters.)\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\n\"Not to mention that the legacy of the Sanders campaign (such as the \"Squad\") will ravage any chance center-left Democrats have of maintaining hard-won victories in states from Pennsylvania to California,\u201d Rasky added."}}
