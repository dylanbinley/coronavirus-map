Both leaders confirmed \"readiness to continue cooperation within OPEC+,\" it said. The kingdom also confirmed the call.\n\nSaudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz. Credit:AP\n\nUS crude futures sank below $US50 a barrel for the first time in more than a year on Monday, as fears gripped investors that the deadly coronavirus outbreak in China is crushing demand in the world's biggest oil-importing nation. Global benchmark Brent crude in London slid below $US55 to the lowest in over a year.\n\nThe rout has added pressure on the producer group, and while leading member Saudi Arabia has been pushing since last week for action, it has met resistance from Russia. Oil demand in China is said to have plunged as much as 20 per cent because of the virus outbreak, with cities in lockdown, flights cancelled, and refineries curbing operations."}}
