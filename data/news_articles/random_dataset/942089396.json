It\u2019s getting worse.\u201d\n\nJackson and her team at Minnie\u2019s Food Pantry in Plano are used to feeding 5,000 every month but last month, the pandemic pushed the number to 33,000.\n\n\u201cWe have individuals coming in who say, \u2018I no longer have a job,. What am I going to do?\u2019 So that number is higher than anticipated, and we don't see an end to it, \u201c Jackson said, \u201cand that's what's frightening.\u201d\n\nYet, Jackson is known as a woman of action. Saturday morning, volunteers will set up a drive-through, contactless food pantry in the parking lot of One Community Church.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/minniesfoodpantry\n\n\u201cWe prepared for 2,000. We\u2019ve got a little over 1,200 registered. So, we\u2019ve got room for about 800 more families. They just need to sign up at minniesfoodpantry.org so that we reserve the box,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nEvery car that comes through will get food, produce and milk while supplies last.\n\n\u201cThey're gonna go home with over a hundred pounds of food,\u201d Jackson smiled. \u201cAnd we\u2019re so happy to be part. We're so happy to help those in need because it used to be me.\u201d\n\nThe charismatic, energetic smiling woman and her sons were once where so many are now -- in need of food.\n\n\u201cWe used to be that family,\u201d said son Robert Jackson. \u201cSo when she said she was trying to feed me, she was.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was seven or eight when I couldn\u2019t give him a meal. And I remember that feeling. And I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to feel what I felt when I couldn\u2019t feed my own family,\u201d Cheryl Jackson said.\n\nThat experience led her to open Minnie\u2019s Food Pantry in 2008. Her father passed away that year, and Jackson wanted to do something to honor her mother Minnie while she was still living. Cheryl Jackson grew up in a family that helped others, so helping families get healthy meals became the mission.\n\n\u201cWhen you can\u2019t provide for your family from a husband\u2019s point or a spouse or a wife or mother, there is no more pain than that,\u201d Jackson said.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve been a grown boy. I'm still growing. And I\u2019m 32 but it's been a beautiful journey feeding families next to her and making a difference,\u201d said son Robert who quit his job in the mortgage business to join his mother.\n\n\u201cI felt like my grandfather called me from heaven to tend to my mother and her mission and her purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cI know the good Lord placed it on my heart to serve her and serve others.\u201d\n\nJackson\u2019s motto is Feed Just One but in 12 years, she\u2019s served more than 11 million meals and more will be fed on Saturday. Every car that rolls through will get enough food to put a temporary pause in worrying about the next meal.\n\n\u201cWhen you come and pick up that box, you'll be able to go home that night and make a complete meal and have breakfast in the morning with cereal and milk,\u201d she said.\n\nJackson, though believes she\u2019s doing more than \u201cslinging a box in your car.\u201d She believes she\u2019s sending families on their way with some hope on board, hope she carries with her since her mom\u2019s passing in 2015.\n\n\u201cMy mother used to say hope means Having Only Positive Emotions,\u201d she said, \u201cand when we're out there for those two hours, we have nothing but positive emotions to let them know, it's gonna get better. It's gonna get better.\u201d"}}
