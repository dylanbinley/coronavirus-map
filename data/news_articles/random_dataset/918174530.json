The nonprofit serves about 300 people in the Ely area through its foodbank, which has seen an increased demand since the COVID-19 crisis began.\n\n\u201cI thank [Kinross Bald Mountain] so much for your interest and helping us feed hungry people here in Ely,\u201d said Robert Winder with the White Pine Ministerial Association.\n\nBald Mountain Mine also donated $6,000 to the Eureka Senior Center to provide meal and grocery delivery service to about 75 Eureka and Crescent Valley senior citizens. The program has seen increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, when these residents must shelter at home.\n\n\u201cWith this crisis, the donation will allow us to buy more food so we can supply them with more nutritious items because they cannot go out to get food,\u201d said Millie Oram, Eureka Senior Center director."}}
