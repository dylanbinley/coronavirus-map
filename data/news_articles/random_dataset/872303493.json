David L. Goldfein confronted a set of powerful and unusual reactions as he peered out the window to the countryside below.\n\n\n\n\u201cI realized I was looking at the exact same picture my dad looked at in the cockpit of his F-4 (Phantom II); I looked down and saw this big river that was flowing very red with mud and I said, \u2018Well, there it is, the Red River Valley\u2019 as it came into view,\u201d Goldfein said.\n\n\n\nGen. CQ Brown Jr, Pacific Air Forces commander, was on the flight as well. He too experienced a similar swell of memories and emotions as the plane closed in on Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a young officer, my father did two tours in Vietnam working special operations intelligence and subsequently as an adviser to a South Vietnamese transportation unit. As we flew in, I reflected on my memories of my dad leaving home and at such a young age not fully appreciating he\u2019d gone to war in this very country,\u201d Brown said.\n\n\n\nFor Americans of a certain age like Goldfein and Brown, Vietnam remains an unshakable memory even today, 44 years after the era-defining war ended. The memory and the reactions it triggers are even more pronounced for people like Goldfein and Brown \u2013 second-generation service members whose fathers fought in a war whose legacy continues to influence military thinking and strategy to this day.\n\n\n\nThe view from the window and the memories it triggered, however, were misleading.\n\n\n\nIn two days of meetings with senior Vietnamese officials, the prevailing atmosphere was how best to work together. What Goldfein and Brown experienced was the new Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what kind of reception we\u2019d get given our history between our two countries,\u201d Goldfein conceded. \u201cWhat was really rewarding was how sincerely warm the reception was.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThose that had once been my father\u2019s adversaries were now our partners focused on common security interests,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe were warmly received by our Vietnam hosts, a complete (departure) from the reception experienced by our Vietnam-era POWs.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat is no illusion. Despite an anguished past, the connection today between the United States and Vietnam has realized achievements on multiple fronts and holds potential for even broader cooperation.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. normalized trade relations with Vietnam in 1994 and diplomatic relations were fully restored in 1995. More recently, Vietnam joined the World Trade Organization in 2007. Vietnam is now the United States\u2019 16th largest trading partner and the U.S. ranks as Vietnam\u2019s third largest trading partner.\n\n\n\nAlong with Indonesia and Malaysia, Vietnam is emerging as an important fixture in a changing region. As such, U.S. policy toward Vietnam includes efforts to build a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d that is rooted in \u201ccommon interests and principles, including freedom of navigation, respect for a rules-based order in accordance with international law and recognition of national sovereignty.\u201d\n\n\n\nDistinct actions clearly illustrate that posture and highlight the \u201cthen and now\u201d nature of the relationship.\n\n\n\nGoldfein\u2019s visit marked the first time a U.S. Air Force chief of staff came to Vietnam since the war ended. Another major example of how relations have changed occurred last year, when a U.S. aircraft carrier came to Vietnam for the first time since the war ended.\n\n\n\nMore broadly, the U.S. military engages in numerous annual training exchanges and activities to enhance bilateral cooperation and interoperability with the Vietnam People\u2019s Army, Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard.\n\n\n\nExperts support the conclusion by Goldfein and Brown that Vietnam offers an opportunity for the U.S. to cooperate on security issues.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile disagreements over the (U.S.-Vietnam) trade imbalance could temporarily stall progress, China\u2019s growing influence in the region will likely push U.S. and Vietnamese strategic interests closer together,\u201d the Council on Foreign Relations concluded in a 2019 analysis of U.S. and Vietnam relations.\n\n\n\nThe connection came through during meetings, Goldfein said.\n\n\n\n\u201cHere we are sitting in this room as the second generation of combatants who went after one another all those years and we are talking about partnership. It was surreal,\u201d he said of the conversation with senior Vietnamese military leaders in Hanoi.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very serious about legacy war issues, including efforts to help clean up dioxin (better known as Agent Orange, a cancer-causing defoliant that was sprayed across the countryside during the war). We\u2019re also serious about the repatriation of remains, including Vietnamese remains when they are found,\u201d Goldfein said.\n\n\n\nAnother catalyst is China, which is moving to expand its influence. It is especially active in the South China Sea off Vietnam\u2019s coast.\n\n\n\nVietnam and other countries have taken note and reacted, Brown said.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed the increased focus and whole-of-government efforts by nations to ensure a safe and secure environment free of coercion,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is more bilateral and multilateral cooperation and collaboration than in year\u2019s past.\u201d\n\n\n\nDespite the history, Goldfein said there were no awkward moments.\n\n\n\n\u201cNone at all. If you think about it, this is not new. How many aces have befriended their fellow aces? \u2026 In every conflict afterwards, sometimes the profession of arms gets you beyond the animosities that got you to go to war in the first place.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd yet, despite the emergence of the \u201cnew\u201d Vietnam, memories of an earlier time were never far from Goldfein or Brown.\n\n\n\nFrom their hotel in Hanoi, they could see the red rooftop of what remains of the notorious Hanoi Hilton, a prison camp operated by the North Vietnamese, where U.S. servicemen were held in harsh conditions in some cases for years. Among them were Air Force pilots Lee Ellis and Bud Day. Each endured more than five years in prison.\n\n\n\nGoldfein, who during the trip was reading Ellis\u2019s book, \u201cLeading with Honor,\u201d chronicling his years as a prisoner of war, was able to tour the prison with Brown.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat only made it more personal, that I was standing in a cell that (Ellis) probably spent some time in or John McCain,\u201d Goldfein said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty surreal and moving.\u201d\n\n\n\nBrown\u2019s reaction was similar.\n\n\n\n\u201cStanding in one of the concrete cells for just a few moments. I reflected on the fact that many of our POWs spent not moments, but years in these cells under arduous conditions. It was a very sobering experience,\u201d he said."}}
