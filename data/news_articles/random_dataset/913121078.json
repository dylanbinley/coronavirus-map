David Goldfein said that new, secret technology would replace the RQ-4s and other planes the service wants to retire. \u201cMost of what we\u2019re giving up is unclassified,\u201d Goldfein told Defense News. \u201cWhat we\u2019re buying \u2014 not all but a lot of it \u2014 is in the classified realm.\u201d\n\nGoldfein\u2019s comment could hint at the Air Force\u2019s acquisition of RQ-180 stealth spy drones. But it\u2019s worth remembering that the flying branch also possesses another secretive drone type that service leaders don\u2019t often talk about. The RQ-170 Sentinel.\n\nOne of the last times the RQ-170 appeared in public was back in 2017, when a photographer spotted what appeared to be a new variant of the drone.\n\nMatt Hartman of Shorealone Films photographed an apparently heavily-modified Sentinel while covering the launch of a top-secret satellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base in southern California on March 1, 2017.\n\nThe batwing RQ-170, which Hartman observed from below and head-on while the drone was in flight with its landing gear lowered, sported dark-colored paneling along its leading-edge and under its port wing, as well as a instrument probe \u2014 all previously-unseen features on the Sentinel.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what, if any, new capabilities the modified Sentinel possesses \u2014 or what new missions the Air Force might assign to the apparently-upgraded drone. It\u2019s worth noting that the Air Force quietly began flying RQ-170s from Vandenberg as early as 2011, according to documents that journalist Joseph Trevithick obtained via the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe 30th Reconnaissance Squadron, the main Sentinel unit, flies from Creech Air Force Base in Nevada. Vandenberg mostly handles space launches. But the remote installation could become a major drone hub. The base previously hosted Global Hawk spy drones and the secretive X-37B robotic space plane, and is a candidate to receive a new wing of Reaper hunter-killer drones.\n\nVandenberg is adjacent to the U.S. Navy\u2019s 36,000-square-mile Pacific Range ocean test site. Reporter Tyler Rogoway, editor of The War Zone blog, exclusively published Hartman\u2019s photographs of the modified RQ-170.\n\nRogoway has his own theories about the drone\u2019s modifications.\n\n\u201cThe RQ-170, with its electro-optical sensors and what most experts think is a highly sensitive AESA-based synthetic aperture radar \u2026 could make the aircraft a potent targeting and surveillance node in an anti-access maritime and/or littoral combat environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cProving that the RQ-170\u2019s talents can be applied to the surface warfare realm would require that the aircraft have access to such an environment,\u201d Rogoway added, \u201cand the middle of the Nevada desert surely does not offer that kind of an opportunity, but Vandenberg AFB certainly does.\u201d\n\nIf Rogoway is right and the Sentinel is taking on a maritime role, it could greatly expand what is already a diverse mission portfolio. The Air Force reportedly acquired around 30 RQ-170s from Lockheed Martin in the early 2000s and deployed them for surveillance missions over Iraq in 2003.\n\nIn 2007, a photographer spotted a Sentinel at Kandahar airfield in southern Afghanistan \u2014 the radar-evading drone\u2019s public debut. The Air Force copped to the RQ-170\u2019s existence in 2009, the same year the flying branch deployed the pilotless aircraft to Guam and South Korea on temporary tours.\n\nA Sentinel reportedly spied on Osama Bin Laden\u2019s compound during the May 2011 raid by Navy SEALs that killed the terrorist leader. And in December 2011, an RQ-170 crashed on the Iran-Afghanistan border and was seized by Iranian officials for display and study.\n\nThat Sentinel\u2019s frequent proximity to Iran and North Korea raised the possibility that the Air Force was sending the stealth drone on missions to investigate nuclear-weapons facilities.\n\nCorroborating that theory, the Air Force implied in a document dated 2013 \u2014 which Trevithick also obtained via the Freedom of Information Act \u2014 that the RQ-170 had participated in \u201cnational collection missions,\u201d which is military code for specialized strategic reconnaissance, often targeting nuclear installations.\n\nFrom Special Operations Forces support to nuclear-snooping, in 2012 the Sentinel\u2019s mission set expanded to include post-strike recon for B-2 stealth bombers, according to yet another document that Trevithick obtained via the federal information law.\n\nIn October 2012 at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, the Air Force tested a new version of the 15-ton Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a special bomb that the B-2 can drop to destroy deeply-buried strategic targets, including command bunkers and nuclear sites.\n\nAs part of the test, an RQ-170 followed behind the MOP-dropping stealth bomber in order to assess the results of the simulated strike. In a real-world raid, a B-2 could bomb a buried target and a Sentinel could perform post-attack battle-damage assessment.\n\nThe steady addition of new missions over the Sentinel\u2019s roughly 15-year existence represents a strong vote of confidence on the part of the Air Force in the stealth drone\u2019s usefulness, despite Iran\u2019s capture of one of the robots in 2011.\n\nThe apparent new modifications to the RQ-170 inadvertently on display over southern California in March 2017 could point to even more missions to come.\n\nDavid Axe serves as Defense Editor of the National Interest.
