He\u2019s decided he\u2019s going to change whatever he wants.\u201d\n\nSen. Diane Feinstein, D-California, also said Trump was subverting Congress on Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe decision by the administration to divert funds from military construction projects in order to build the president\u2019s ill-conceived wall is irresponsible,\u201d Feinstein said in a statement. \u201cCongress appropriated these funds for specific military construction projects, and that\u2019s how the funds should be used.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to Congress Tuesday, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said the projects were chosen from projects not scheduled until 2020 or later and funds from overseas projects would be used first.\n\nAs the Union-Tribune reported in February, almost $1 billion in San Diego-area projects were on the list of vulnerable projects \u2014 including the new Navy SEAL facilities in Coronado and infrastructure for new aircraft at Naval Air Station North Island and Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.\n\nThe list released Wednesday includes just one California project \u2014 an $8 million flight simulator at Channel Islands Air National Guard Station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFeinstein said the simulator was to train pilots for disaster response.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m particularly concerned that the Defense Department is taking $8 million away from the California Air National Guard,\u201d she said. \u201cThose funds were intended for a C-130 simulator at Channel Islands Air Guard Station so pilots could train for disaster response.\u201d\n\nRep. Duncan Hunter, R-Alpine, himself a Marine Corps veteran, has positioned himself as both a supporter of the military and of Trump. While he did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday, a spokesman told the Union-Tribune in February that military readiness and border security were not \u201cmutually exclusive.\u201d\n\nRobert McMahon, assistant secretary of defense for sustainment, testified at a House Appropriations Subcommittee hearing in February that the Pentagon would request to fund the projects again in the next fiscal year budget. The $3.6 billion was included in the 2020 fiscal year budget that has yet to be reconciled between the House and Senate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile projects that are being deferred don\u2019t include military housing specifically, some could potentially impact quality-of-life for service members and their families, such as a new child development center at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, and a new high school in Yokosuka, Japan.\n\nThe deferments will also affect Hurricane Maria recovery at Puerto Rico military facilities.\n\nPeters said Trump was \u201cfleecing\u201d military members for political purposes.\n\n\u201cToday he\u2019s broken his promise to the country,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLate Wednesday, the Defense Department released a list of border projects it would construct with the deferred funds, including $67 million for new fencing east of the Otay Mesa Port of Entry and 3.5 miles of fencing around the Tecate Port of Entry."}}
