Officers spotted Bolin\u2019s vehicle in a field at the base of a hill, and noticed the rear window of the SUV appeared to be shot out.\n\nDeputy Brent Hall came under fire from the wooded area, and took cover while calling for assistance from other officers.\n\nBolin also fired at officers who tried to communicate with him when they arrived at the scene.\n\n\u201cThank God, none of them [the police] were hit by the shots,\u201d Modesitt said.\n\nBolin\u2019s weapons included a .357 Ruger handgun, a Mossberg 12 gauge shotgun, a sawed off double barrel shotgun and multiple knives. Bolin also had dozens of additional rounds and cartridges in his possession.\n\nOfficers tried to make verbal contact with Bolin, said Sgt. Matt Ames, who was with Reserve Deputy Elias Donker when Bolin fired at Ames.\n\nDeputy Donker returned fire with two shots. One of those shots was fatal to Bolin.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of a clearer cut situation where lethal force would be permitted under Indiana law than the facts of this case,\u201d Modesitt said. \u201cThere is no dispute that the shots fired by the deputy were justified and legal under Indiana law.\u201d\n\nThis article will be updated."}}
