Scientific people, intelligence people, and others. We\u2019re going to put it all together. I think we will have a very good answer eventually. And China might even tell us.\n\nAsked for any evidence that the virus came from the lab, Trump responded, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that. I\u2019m not allowed to tell you that.\u201d\n\nOther countries, including the US, UK, and Russia, hold samples of deadly viruses to study them and pursue defenses.\n\nBefore Trump\u2019s appearance at an event alongside Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence stated US intelligence \u201cconcurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified\u201d.\n\nThe intelligence community will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.\n\nTrump spoke as the US death toll reached 63,000 with 1,069,826 confirmed cases.\n\nTrump\u2019s Ignorance of Intelligence: \u201cWho Said That?\u201d\n\nIt was unclear whether Trump was claiming that the lab created the virus or whether the facility had allowed a natural strain to escape.\n\nBut he immediately undermined his assertion by showing complete ignorance of the US intelligence assessment.\n\nQ: You said a moment ago, you will soon have information on where this virus originated. The Director of National Intelligence today put out a statement saying that they believe it was naturally occurring, it was not man-made. TRUMP: Who is that? Who is that said that? Q: The Office of the Director of National [Intelligence]\u2026. TRUMP: Who, in particular? Who was the man who made that statement?\u2026 Q: That would be your Director of National Intelligence. TRUMP: Right now, I think it\u2019s\u2026. I mean, you\u2019d have to tell me who specifically, who made the statement. Q: The statement was just put out under the Office of the [Director of National Intelligence]. TRUMP: Okay, we\u2019ll see. I mean, I have to see the statement. I just haven\u2019t seen it.\n\nHaving admitted ignorance, Trump persisted when asked, \u201cHave you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?\u201d\n\nHe responded, \u201cYes, I have. Yes, I have.\u201d\n\nJOHN ROBERTS: The Director of National Intelligence put out a statement saying they think the coronavirus was naturally occurring TRUMP: Who? R: It was a statement from the DNI office TRUMP: Oh, he would know that, huh?

They were either unable to or they chose not to.\u201d\n\nMinutes later, Trump shifted his attention to his pursuit of a second Presidential term, in a confusing ramble:\n\nChina doesn\u2019t want to see me elected and the reason is that we\u2019re getting billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars a month from China. China never gave our country anything. China gave us nothing, not 25 cents. And whether it was [former Vice President and presumptive Democratic Presidential nominee Joe] Biden in charge of China, which was a joke because they ripped off our country for eight years. And in all fairness to Biden and Obama, this went on long before they got into office. And you can go through many administrations until I came along. Then we signed a trade deal where they\u2019re supposed to buy, and they\u2019ve been buying a lot actually, but that now becomes secondary to what took place with the virus. The virus situation is just not acceptable.\n\nAsked if he thought China was withholding information to undermine his re-election, Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to cast any dispersions. I just will tell you that China would like to see sleepy Joe Biden. They would take this country for a ride like you\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nTrump concludes the press conference by suggesting his praise for China ended when the coronavirus hit the US, but that's not true. He was praising the Chinese govt on Twitter as recently as late March, before the search for a scapegoat began in earnest https://t.co/pIsNTgVFyi pic.twitter.com/XTbmpJHQdM \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 30, 2020\n\nThe Republican Tactics\n\nAs Trump struggled with criticism of his handling of the crisis, the National Republican Senatorial Committee distributed a 57-page memo on April 17, guiding GOP candidates in attacks on China.\n\nThe suggested lines are that China caused the virus \u201cby covering it up\u201d, that Democrats are \u201csoft on China\u201d, and that Republicans will \u201cpush for sanctions on China for its role in spreading this pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe urgency for the campaign escalated in the past week as Trump was criticized and mocked for his comments suggesting that people inject disinfectant as a cure for Coronavirus.\n\nSee also EA on talkRADIO: Why is No One Stopping Trump\u2019s Dangerous Coronavirus Statements?\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that claims of Coronavirus\u2019s release from a laboratory are \u201cunfounded and purely fabricated out of nothing\u201d.\n\nSpokesman Geng Shuang said, \u201cThe US presidential election is an internal affair, we have no interest in interfering in it.\u201d He advised American politicians to spend their time on \u201cbetter controlling the epidemic situation at home\u201d.\n\nThe World Health Organization\u2019s representative in China, Gauden Galea, said the WHO has asked to join research into the origins of the virus: \u201cWe know that some national investigation is happening but at this stage we have not been invited to join.\u201d\n\nHe said the WHO has not been allowed to see logs from the two laboratories in Wuhan working on viruses: however, \u201cfrom all available evidence, WHO colleagues in our three-level system are convinced that the origins are in Wuhan and that it is a naturally occurring, not a manufactured, virus\u201d.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Friday: \u201cWhat we have before us doesn\u2019t suggest that (a lab in Wuhan) is a likely source.\u201d Canberra is calling for an \u201cobjective assessment\u201d by an independent international team."}}
