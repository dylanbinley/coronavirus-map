Besides, most guests of my parents are elderly who are more vulnerable to the coronavirus infection. Even if we accepted the financial damages from postponing the ceremony, who can be sure whether the spread of the coronavirus will subside or not?\" Lee said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChung Beom-yoon, a 31-year-old veterinarian in Guri, Gyeonggi Province, whose wedding ceremony is scheduled for early September, said he has not even come up with a Plan B if the current toughened social distancing rule is extended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My fiancee and I have been preparing for the wedding for almost a year. We're so disappointed at what's going on these days, and we really don't want to postpone it again,\" Chung said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to the complaints from many consumers, the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) said Friday that the Korea Wedding Business Association (WBA) has accepted a request to minimize the damage suffered by soon-to-be married couples ahead of the ceremony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FTC earlier requested the association to allow couples to postpone weddings without paying cancelation charges or reducing the number of guaranteed guests, or lose their non-refundable deposit, because fewer people are expected to attend the ceremony than initially predicted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe WBA accepted the request of the FTC. If a customer requests a postponement of their ceremony date, the date can be rescheduled without cancellation charges for up to six months from the original one. Also, if the wedding ceremony proceeds as scheduled, the minimum number of guaranteed guests will be reduced and adjusted according to the circumstances of the individual wedding venue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
