Photo: Xinhua More\n\nChina has long-standing security interests in the country and in 2016 it agreed to finance 11 border outposts and a training centre for guards along the Afghan border.\n\nThis was part of a deal Beijing made through the Quadrilateral Cooperation and Coordination Mechanism \u2013 which also involves Pakistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan \u2013 to strengthen cooperation in combating terrorism and improving security.\n\nChina has also overtaken Russia economically, becoming the largest foreign investor in Tajikistan in 2016, accounting for 30 per cent of Tajikistan's total direct accumulated investments, state news agency Xinhua reported.\n\nChina\u2019s direct investment in Tajikistan was worth US$95 million in 2017, according to the latest available figures. China has also grown to become the country\u2019s third largest trading partner with bilateral trade reaching around US$1.5 billion in 2018.\n\nStory continues"}}
