And I think it\u2019s shared by a whole lot of people,\u201d the mayor said during a press conference Thursday afternoon.\n\nEarlier Thursday, St. Paul police confronted protesters and looters in the city\u2019s Midway neighborhood. Police Chief Todd Axtell called looting \u201cunprecedented,\u201d and asked parents of young adults and teenagers to keep them off the streets.\n\nMore than 170 businesses were damaged or looted, and dozens of fires were reported, St. Paul police said Thursday night.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t tolerate people being injured in this city. We won\u2019t tolerate buildings being burned down,\u201d Axtell said.\n\nIn Minneapolis Daylight reveals destruction; Walz calls out Guard amid protests\n\nCarter urged St. Paul residents to stay away from the area and remain home as looting and a fire were reported in the city\u2019s Midway neighborhood.\n\nAround 6 p.m., MPR News reporter Peter Cox reported that smoke was billowing out of a business on University Avenue off Hamline Street, and that the city\u2019s Fire Department was responding. An hour later, Cox said police appeared to be using tear gas to push people in the area away from the fire.\n\nJust before 2 p.m., MPR News producer Megan Burks reported looters had moved to a liquor store on the south side of University Avenue and that there were hot spots of trouble throughout the Midway neighborhood.\n\nTwenty minutes later, St. Paul police said on Twitter that officers were working to \u201cdisperse large groups of people causing property damage along University Avenue.\u201d\n\nThe agency said officers were being pelted with rocks, liquor bottles and bricks around the Midway Target store on University Avenue.\n\nBy 2:45 p.m., MPR News reporter Tim Nelson called it an \u201cextremely chaotic scene\u201d on University Avenue between Snelling Avenue and Lexington Parkway, with a tense standoff outside the Midway Target.\n\nAround 4:30 p.m., St. Paul Police Department alerted via its tweet that a fire was reported at a store at a strip mall near the Midway Target on University Avenue.\n\nWhile Midway was the center of St. Paul\u2019s confrontations, officers were giving similar dispersal orders to groups around the 1700 block of Suburban Avenue on the the city\u2019s east side.\n\nOn the Capitol grounds in St. Paul, buildings and offices of lawmakers, state court staff and judges have been evacuated out of precaution.
