The authorities have accused him of working for Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe indictment states that the Hezbollah commander is a member of a terrorist organization and engaged in the finance of terrorism activities. He could face a 10-year prison sentence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paper said that a similar case involving an accused jihadi terrorist resulted in a late arrest. The Jerusalem Post has reported that Hezbollah operatives who blew up an Israeli tour bus in Burgas, Bulgaria, fled to Lebanon and the authorities in Beirut refused to extradite the accused terrorists. They murdered five Israelis and their Bulgarian Muslim bus driver during the bus bomb attack in 2012.\n\nIn 2019, Peter Gridling, director of the Austrian federal agency responsible for combating terrorism, said the biggest danger for Austria is Islamic terrorism.\n\n\n\nAustria\u2019s 2018 intelligence report, the most recent document on covering terror threats, lists Islamic terrorism but does not address the danger in specific terms. For example, the Iranian-sponsored Hezbollah organization is not listed.\n\nThe US governments under both the Obama and Trump presidencies have designated Iran as the top state-sponsor of international terrorism.\n\nAustria\u2019s intelligence agency did not even mention the Islamic Republic of Iran in its report. Assadollah Assadi, a Vienna-based Iranian diplomat, was arrested in 2018 in connection with a plot to blow up an Iranian dissident near Paris in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustria and the European Union have merely classified Hezbollah\u2019s so-called \u201cmilitary wing\u201d a terrorist entity. The US, England, the Netherlands, the Arab League, Israel and a number of Latin American countries designated Hezbollah\u2019s entire movement a terrorist organization. Hezbollah\u2019s leadership admits this, declaring itself a unified organization without political and military wings.\n\n\n\n\n\nGermany\u2019s Bundestag passed a December resolution urging the federal government to outlaw Hezbollah activities in the country.\n\nThe unnamed Hezbollah"}}
