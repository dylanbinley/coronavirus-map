Click here to read the introduction to the series, and here to browse the collection.\n\nWhen I ask Rabbi Sandra Lawson to address whether God hears us, she basically flips the question. Do we hear God? And by extension, each other?\n\nShe doesn\u2019t do this explicitly, but it becomes clear, as we discuss her vision of the divine, that God is about paying attention \u2014 to what is expected of us and whom we could help.\n\nIt\u2019s a timely take, considering the time when Lawson and I speak: after the weeks of Black Lives Matter protests spurred by the killing of George Floyd. The country\u2019s racial reckoning has caused us to look at our own culpability, and particularly our own house: how differently Jews of color are treated in our communities, and how rarely they hold leadership positions in our organizations.\n\nLawson, 50, is Associate Chaplain for Jewish Life at Elon University in North Carolina, and has written that one of the reasons she went to the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College \u201cwas so that others could see that one could be Black, Queer, and be a Jewish leader.\u201d But she admitted that she has grown somewhat weary of this season\u2019s well-intentioned emails and calls from white colleagues and friends seeking wisdom and advice.\n\nStill, she was grateful that so many finally cared enough to ask. And yes, it was a keen example of Lawson\u2019s frame on God: her fellow Jews were essentially saying, \u201cWe\u2019re ready to hear.\u201d\n\nOur conversation is below, edited for clarity and length.

Is that inspiring or exhausting for you?\n\nSandra Lawson: Both. I actually had an email exchange with a Black person with influence in Hillel and he wrote asking some of us if we\u2019re getting inundated with calls. Several Black people work for Hillel, and we know each other. We all agreed that this moment is too important to ignore requests, but we\u2019re also trying to support each other to manage the requests.\n\nAP: Do you think it\u2019s too much of a leap to say that God was in the response to George Floyd\u2019s death? God was in the reckoning?\n\nSL: That was definitely God moving through the protestors. The young people who were in the streets, particularly the young Jews, were using their Jewish values to articulate why this matters, which I think is really beautiful \u2014 how God shows up.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of Christians do the same. We\u2019re in this awakening, when people want to learn and know. They\u2019re saying, \u201cI always thought our country was equitable, and now I\u2019m seeing it\u2019s really not. Or maybe I always knew that it wasn\u2019t, but I didn\u2019t want to hear it, but now I have to \u2014because George Floyd\u2019s death was in front of me on the screen.\u201d\n\nAP: You talk about God moving through the protestors, but many Jews of color or gay Jews might have trouble seeing themselves in Jewish texts. Do you feel you have to work harder to make Torah relevant to those whom the story leaves out or diminishes?\n\nSL: The people who wrote these texts and commentaries were men with the biases of their century; I see them more as representative of the time period in which the rabbis were living. And some of our texts, even though they make us uncomfortable, you can still see the Rabbis trying to be more respectful to women, or worried about procreation and the survival of the Jewish people.\n\nBecause of my background, I\u2019m going to have different views from an Orthodox man who has no exposure to gay people and is worried about producing more Jewish children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018I certainly don\u2019t think of God in anthropomorphic terms\u2019\n\nAP: Can you say a little more about your faith personally?\n\nSL: For me, God didn\u2019t enter the picture until my second or third year of rabbinical school. It\u2019s interesting \u2014 a Sufi came to teach one of our classes, and I said to her, \u201cI\u2019m not really in search of God.\u201d And she said, \u201cWe\u2019re always on a journey of searching, whether we realize it or not.\u201d That stayed with me.\n\nAP: For many of the rabbis I\u2019m talking to, God is not a being, but a presence, a force for compassion and responsibility,\n\nSL: I certainly don\u2019t think of God in anthropomorphic terms, that God is a person. When we say God is a \u201cbeing,\u201d it limits what God is. Rabbi Mordechai Kaplan described God as a force for salvation.\n\nAP: Your colleagues also suggest that God is in the things that are magnificent or have power beyond their scientific fact set.\n\nSL: Yes. The fact that the sun and the moon come up, all the things that happen with no explanation \u2014 that I can talk to God and get clarity\u2026..\n\nAP: You can talk to God and get clarity?\n\nSL: I do. I used to hear my Christian friends say, \u201cJust give it up to God and it will be fine!\u201d I never liked that. But sometimes there are moments in our lives when we need to get out of our heads. So that phrase, \u201cGiving it up to God,\u201d or \u201cLetting God work through me\u201d to guide me through something \u2014 it sometimes frees us up, to look with clarity.\n\nAP: You\u2019re saying there\u2019s guidance gained by trying to think less and let God take the lead a bit?\n\nSL: Because I have that trust, I can work on a problem for a long time, and I can then say, \u201cI need help.\u201d So I do feel heard.\n\nAP: Have there been times when you didn\u2019t? When you said essentially, \u201cGod, where are you?\u201d\n\nSL: Not really. I do have times when I have been hurt \u2014 in relationships or jobs. But I have had the trust that this job or relationship was not where I was supposed to be. It doesn\u2019t take away the pain when it\u2019s happening. But then I say to myself, \u201cObviously there\u2019s something better for me, and I just have to figure out what that is.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018I was heartbroken\u2019\n\nAP: Can you give a personal example of where you had to essentially \u201cgive it up to God,\u201d as you put it?\n\nSL: I was asked to apply for a pulpit job and it was a really good fit and a really good search committee, but the way that racism showed up when I didn\u2019t get the position was very hard. The candidate they hired was clearly not the right fit and the rabbi and community realize that now. But I was heartbroken, because I\u2019d felt, \u201cThis is where I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d Obviously that community wasn\u2019t ready for me. It made me question things.\n\nAP: I imagine it could shake your sense of Jewish values \u2014 to have a community invite you to apply and then say it won\u2019t work.\n\nSL: It was difficult. But now I\u2019m definitely in a much better place here at a university as the Associate Chaplain for Jewish Life. I\u2019m also the only Black chaplain, so a lot of students come to me who are not Jewish \u2014 people of color.\n\nThe Black students who seek me out usually have a question or challenge around their faith and don\u2019t feel they can talk to the chaplain who represents their own religion. This is why it\u2019s so beautiful to have five chaplains.\n\nFor Black students on campus who are Catholic, their chaplain is a white male, which can be hard for them. I may not be Christian, but I have their lived experience. And I\u2019m also a person of faith. I can help them with their issues around belief.\n\nAP: Again, it gets to your idea of who is listening and how attentively. You\u2019re making me think that my question of whether God hears us should be: How closely are we listening?\n\nSL: There\u2019s a midrash that says the burning bush had been burning for a long time and most people ignored it, and then Moses comes along, sees it, and he turns \u2014 that\u2019s when God calls to him and he turns.\n\nMoses said, \u201cI must turn aside to look at this marvelous sight; why doesn\u2019t the bush burn up?\u201d\n\nWhen the LORD saw that he had turned aside to look, God called to him out of the bush: \u201cMoses! Moses!\u201d He answered, \u201cHere I am.\u201d\n\n-Exodus 3:2\n\nAP: Which reminds us that we have to pay attention. God might have been calling and we were too busy to hear it.\n\nSL: It reminds us that God can be in the ordinary.\n\nAP: A bush on fire isn\u2019t ordinary.\n\nSL: A thornbush is. God doesn\u2019t always appear in some extraordinary place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018If you see God in the everyday\u2019\n\nAP: The midrash you cited suggests the thornbush was used intentionally: it\u2019s an unexciting plant, which proves that God\u2019s power is in the mundane.\n\nSL: If you see God in the everyday, if you wake up in the morning and instead of saying, \u201cThis day sucks,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not happy,\u201d you greet the world with joy.\n\nOur liturgy reminds us to wake up and say \u201cModeh \u2014or Modah\u2014 ani\u201d \u2014 thank you, God, for restoring my soul, you\u2019ve given me another day. Thank you for my breath, my body\u2019s ability to go to the bathroom. All of the morning liturgy is around gratitude, and by the time you get to your call to prayer, you have this sense of blessing.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if whoever wrote these texts, knew that before you could be open to calling to God, you needed to be filled with appreciation.\n\nAP: It\u2019s a poignant note to end on \u2014 that God gives us breath. It brings us back to those whose breath was cut short.\n\nSL: You watch what happened in Georgia with Ahmaud Arbery, and then you listen to a 911 call with Breonna Taylor, and then you watch what happened to George Floyd \u2014 he was the cannon, the overflowing of water.\n\nAP: Maybe there will be a new kind of listening now.\n\nAbigail Pogrebin @apogrebin, a freelance journalist, author, and public speaker, is a Forward contributing writer.
