I\u2019m only crying because they are not seeing the motive behind the things I have been accused of, most of the things were motivated by the issue of money more than anything else. I think the authorities will extract the truth, since the word gender refer to both men and women, I anticipate my right as a citizen of Zimbabwe will be protected,\u201d Magaya said.\n\nMagaya refuted claims that he was bribing the ZGC to stop investigations into the matter.\n\n\u201cI do not even know them or how many they are. Where would I get them, I\u2019m always at my church praying and attending services. I don\u2019t think the commission are small people who can be bribed, I don\u2019t think they are unprofessional to be bribed, I think they are professional people doing their work and I don\u2019t intend to stop them. I will just allow the law to take its course, that\u2019s what I will do,\u201d refutes the PHD Ministries leader.\n\nMagaya has been at the centre of s3xual harassment allegations with most of the alleged victims turning back on their word and apologizing to the man of the cloth.\n\n\u2013 ZBC\n\nBreaking News via Email\n\nLoading...\n\nPin 18 Shares"}}
