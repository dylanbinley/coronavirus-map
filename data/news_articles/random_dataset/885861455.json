Canadian business leaders and politicians are meeting in the city at the annual gathering of the Canada China Business Council. JOHANNES EISELE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s time for Ottawa and Beijing to settle their differences and get back to business, leaders of Canada\u2019s corporate interests in China said Monday, nearly a year after the arrest of a Huawei executive in the Vancouver airport dragged the two countries into a protracted diplomatic and economic standoff.\n\nThe dispute has brought Canada into conflict with China\u2019s authoritarian leadership while Beijing has accused Ottawa of politically motivated justice. Canadian critics have accused Beijing of practising hostage diplomacy for what is widely seen as its retaliatory arrest of two Canadians last December.\n\nNow, some of the senior-most Canadian figures doing business with China say it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cCitizens from both countries have been detained. Canadians strongly wish to see their citizens come home safely and be reunited with their families. The Chinese people also wish to see the same,\u201d said Olivier Desmarais, senior vice-president at Power Corp. and chair of the Canada China Business Council, which held an annual gathering in Shanghai Monday. The meeting\u2019s corporate sponsors included Bank of Montreal, Huawei, Bombardier and Manulife \u2013 each with an interest in smoother relations between the two countries.\n\n\u201cBusinesses in both countries want their national governments to work their way past this current situation, and as quickly as possible,\u201d Mr. Desmarais said.\n\nThe arrest of Meng Wanzhou, who is accused in the United States of fraud related to sanctions violations in Iran, and China\u2019s subsequent arrests of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor \u2013 whom it has accused of national security violations \u2013 initiated a spiral in relations that saw Canada\u2019s exports to China fall 9 per cent in the first six months of this year, largely the result of a Beijing block on imports of Canadian canola and other agricultural goods.\n\nMs. Meng has been released on bail in Vancouver, but her movements remain restricted. Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor remain in Chinese detention, locked in a system that, former detainees have said, subjects people to privation and humiliation.\n\nLast week, China lifted a block on imports of Canadian beef and pork, however the move was seen as a response to a meat shortage and not a diplomatic opening.\n\nIn September, the two countries each nominated new ambassadors, with Canada sending former McKinsey & Company leader Dominic Barton to Beijing.\n\nAnd senior figures in the Canadian business establishment said they are keen to move on in a country whose economic heft is expected to surpass the U.S. in coming years.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThe opportunity set in the market is huge and the long-term potential for our business in this market is similarly large,\u201d said Stuart Mercier, head of real estate for Asia at Brookfield Asset Management. At Brookfield, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a lot of support, a lot of desire, to grow this business in a region that will play a critical role in the global economy for decades to come,\u201d he said.\n\nBrookfield is hardly alone, as the Canadian corporate establishment seeks to push past more than 11 months of turbulence.\n\nThe federal government gave no indication Monday of how its approach to China is shifting as it nears the one-year mark of Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest on Dec. 1, 2018. None of the federal representatives scheduled to speak in Shanghai delivered public remarks, including Mr. Barton, who was expected to deliver a keynote address but opted instead to mingle with delegates in a Four Seasons hotel ballroom.\n\nA spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada declined to comment, citing the government transition.\n\nOthers in Shanghai, however, said they are hopeful the worst with China has passed.\n\nAmong the most ambitious is the province of Nova Scotia, whose Premier, Stephen McNeil, is currently on his second trip to China this year and his eighth as provincial leader. His staff said he had no interest in commenting on the continuing detention of Mr. Kovrig or Mr. Spavor. Instead, he said in an interview, he is intent on building more trade with China as a way to further diversify the economy in his province, whose exports to China are expected to surpass $1-billion this year, up from $197-million in 2013.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cIf you believe you\u2019re interacting with friends, your economic relationship grows much quicker and more rapidly. That\u2019s why we continue to build this relationship,\u201d he said.\n\nNova Scotia has partnered with the Chinese embassy in Ottawa to sponsor scholarships for its students to study in China, while seeking to double the number of international students in the province. Chinese students currently make up 41 per cent of overseas students in Nova Scotia, which is also working to increase the number of Chinese tourists it receives, setting a goal of 50,000 a year, a 10-fold expansion.\n\nFrictions are for Ottawa and Beijing to resolve, he said. As a provincial leader, his interest is commercial.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to leave it to someone else to go out and make sure that we get high value for our commodities and product,\u201d he said.\n\nEagerness from some parts of the business community to embrace China comes as Canadian public opinion grows more skeptical. In polling by the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, for example, \u201cChina ranks highest among countries from which Canadians are likely to oppose foreign direct investment,\u201d said Stewart Beck, the foundation\u2019s president. \u201cOur friendship is being challenged and tested as never before,\u201d he added, although \u201cwith time and continued engagement, the relationship will endure and grow.\u201d\n\nBut there are risks to interrupting trade with an ascendant superpower, warned Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly difficult to have a start-stop relationship with China. If you withdraw, you\u2019re forgotten. The void is filled tomorrow.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHe called for the Trudeau government to re-examine its foreign policy at a moment when China is economically ascendant and the U.S. is politically uncertain.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Canada to recognize that the world has changed, and we better figure out how we\u2019re going to play in it. Because we\u2019re on our own,\u201d he said. And, he added, \u201cthe idea that we\u2019re going to moralize and preach and lecture societies, in some cases 5,000 years old, hasn\u2019t worked out very well.\u201d\n\nOur Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day\u2019s most important headlines.
