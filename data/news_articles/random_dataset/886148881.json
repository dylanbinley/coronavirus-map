Wheeler.\n\nWheeler has served his country at many locations around the world since originally enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1967.\n\n\u201cWe are here today to honor our service members and remember the sacrifices they have made and the courage it takes to defend our country,\u201d said Wheeler.\n\n\u201cPresident George Washington said \u2018The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their nation,\u2019\u201d said Wheeler.\n\n\u201cWe are here today to honor our heroes, to remember their achievements, their courage and their dedication and to say thank you for their sacrifices,\u201d added Wheeler. \u201cWe stand in the midst of patriots and the family and friends of those who have nobly served.\u201d\n\nWheeler recognizes those who have served, saying, \u201cThank you for answering the call to duty. You have made our armed forces the most respected in the world.\u201d\n\nHe then asked the family members of those who served to stand, and thanked them for what they had done as well.\n\n\u201cThe service members we honor today came from all walks of life but they shared several fundamental qualities. They possessed courage, pride, determination, selflessness, dedication to duty and integrity. All the qualities needed to serve a cause larger than ones self,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cThey didn\u2019t go to war because they loved fighting. They were called to be part of something bigger than themselves. They were ordinary people who responded in extraordinary ways in extreme times. They rose to the nations call because they wanted to protect a nation which has given them, us, so much.\u201d\n\nWheeler graduated from Point Pleasant High School in 1966.
