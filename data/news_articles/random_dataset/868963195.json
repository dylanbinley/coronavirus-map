(From Facebook)\n\nJEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) | Missouri\u2019s attorney general believes that federal law doesn\u2019t protect LGBTQ people from discrimination.\n\nAttorney General Eric Schmitt was among GOP attorneys general nationwide who signed a U.S. Supreme Court brief outlining the position Aug. 23.\n\nThe attorneys general are wading into a legal battle over whether discriminating against someone because they\u2019re gay or transgender violates a federal law banning sex discrimination. The cases will be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on Oct. 8.\n\nSchmitt\u2019s spokesman Chris Nuelle says when the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, sex discrimination did not include transgender people. Nuelle says it\u2019s up to Congress and not the Supreme Court to change that.\n\nNuelle says Schmitt believes that regardless of \u201crace, creed, zipcode or gender,\u201d everyone should be treated with dignity under the law."}}
