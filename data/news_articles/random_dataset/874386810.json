He insisted he had a \u201ctotally appropriate\u201d conversation, without detailing with whom, or what was said, and instead suggested Biden and his son should be investigated for their actions in Ukraine.\n\nBiden responded forcefully, demanding Trump immediately release the transcript of the call and saying the reports Trump sought to coerce his Ukrainian counterpart, if true, amounted to \u201cclear-cut corruption.\u201d\n\nSuspicions have focused on a July 25 call between Trump and Ukraine\u00b4s President Volodymyr Zelensky, a former comedian elected in May. Trump\u00b4s Democratic opponents have been probing that call in connection with allegations Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani tried to pressure the Ukrainian administration.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Trump pressed Zelensky about eight times on the call to investigate possible corruption involving Biden\u00b4s son Hunter, who worked with a Ukrainian natural gas company.\n\nWhen asked by reporters whether he discussed the Bidens with Zelensky, Trump said curtly: \u201cIt doesn\u00b4t matter what I discuss.\u201d\n\nBut he did not deny having done so.\n\nInstead he urged media to \u201clook into\u201d Biden\u00b4s involvement in Ukraine, and his comments in early 2016 in which the former US vice president said the Obama administration would freeze $1 billion in US loan guarantees unless Kiev fire its top prosecutor.\n\n\u201cSomebody ought to look into that,\u201d Trump said.\n\nBiden \u2014 who leads Trump according to most polls \u2014 said the reports show the president\u00b4s \u201cwillingness to abuse his power and abase our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation \u2014 a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia \u2014 pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor,\u201d Biden said in a statement.\n\nAmid the swirling allegations, Giuliani told CNN Thursday that \u201cof course I did\u201d ask Ukraine to investigate Biden. Giuliani said he did not know whether Trump brought up Biden, but said he would have \u201cevery right\u201d to do so.\n\nAdding yet another layer to the controversy, congressional policymakers were concerned the Trump administration had been holding back military aid to Ukraine at the time. The aid was finally released last week.\n\nZelensky inherited an armed conflict against pro-Russian rebels that has killed nearly 13,000 in five years and caused serious economic difficulties.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers say a president conditioning foreign aid on providing dirt on a US election rival would amount to grounds for impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe president can\u00b4t use US aid as a weapon to serve his own political purposes,\u201d House Democrat Seth Moulton tweeted. \u201cThis is an impeachable offense if true.\u201d\n\nClinton herself weighed in Friday with a sharp critique.\n\n\u201cThe president asked a foreign power to help him win an election. Again,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nThe scandal has set Washington on edge, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying the whistleblower complaint raises \u201cgrave, urgent concerns for our national security.\u201d\n\nPresidential candidate Elizabeth Warren called for Trump\u00b4s impeachment, and in a series of tweets criticized Congress for its repeated failure to start the process.\n\nDemocratic candidate Beto O\u00b4Rouke tweeted in support of Biden and said the president needed to be impeached, with fellow candidate Kamala Harris also calling for Trump\u00b4s removal.\n\nAs the crisis swells, Trump and Zelensky will meet for the first time Wednesday, during the UN General Assembly.\n\nTheir talk will focus in part on the \u201cincredible energy and success President Zelensky has put forward in implementing anticorruption efforts,\u201d said a senior US administration official.\n\nThe whistleblower scandal mushroomed this week when House intelligence chairman Adam Schiff revealed the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, had refused to hand over the complaint to Congress."}}
