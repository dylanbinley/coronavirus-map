Instead, the country\u2019s constitution prohibits \u201call forms of violence and abuse in the family\u201d but allows husbands to \u201cdiscipline\u201d their wives.\n\nWhile campaigners have pressured the government to pass laws to prevent violence against women, the groups have had little success as conservative parties still dominate Baghdad.\n\nThe most recent data from 2012 provides an incomplete picture of the scale of domestic abuse, but analysts estimated one in five women are victims.\n\nIraqi lawyer, Mohammed Jumaa, said on Twitter, he had seen hundreds of similar cases, where the lives of abused women, such as Al-Zubaidi, were lost and those responsible were not brought to justice.\n\nAdding, \u201cif it wasn\u2019t for social media in these cases, then the governor would not have said anything\u2026 in our country, you have no rights if social media did not sympathise with you.\u201d"}}
