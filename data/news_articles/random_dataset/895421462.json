This month, after taking in some local sights in the cold winter weather, what better way to warm up than with a cup of free coffee at a very hip new store?\n\nPRINT\u00d6NE\uff5ePB lab is a new style of shop that just opened on Dec 15. Customers can customize their own merchandise with a particular design right on the store premises. It\u2019s also conveniently located on the main Center Gai shopping street and only about a two-minute walk from JR Shibuya Station. After catching wind of such a unique shop, we just knew we had to pay it a visit in person.\n\n\u25bc Directly outside of PRINT\u00d6NE\uff5ePB lab\n\nIf the shop\u2019s core concept wasn\u2019t already original enough, it also houses another novel idea\u2013a cup of free coffee for anyone who walks in. The free coffee is located on a small counter in the corner as soon as you walk in and operates on a self-service honor system.\n\n\u25bc Look for the #Shibuya Free Coffee sign\n\nSetting out free coffee was originally the brainchild of actor, comedian, and author Akihiro Nishino, whose children\u2019s picture book Poupelle of Chimney Town is quite popular. In fact, the woodwork of the counter and detail of the water dispenser were inspired by the whimsical illustrations of Nishino\u2019s fantasy world.\n\n\u25bc Even the wrappers keep with the chimney theme\n\nThe coffee is prepared no-fuss teabag-style, so you just have to pour hot water into a cup and let it brew. Not the fanciest of methods, but beggars can\u2019t be choosers, right?\n\nAt this point, you may be wondering: How does the shop make a profit by offering coffee for free? It turns out that the bags are funded by individuals who purchase 50 cups worth of coffee for 10,000 yen. Part of that fee is donated to Laos, the coffee beans\u2019 country of origin. Anyone can do it, and as the name of the current donor is always displayed behind the coffee packs, it\u2019s actually quite a clever marketing tactic for getting your name out there.\n\n\u25bc This particular batch was sponsored by one Yuta Seto.\n\nPurchases can be made on Nishino\u2019s personal mail order site. Payment is made by either card or through a major Japanese phone carrier (Docomo, au, SoftBank).\n\nSometimes it\u2019s the little things in life that can make a day all that much better. If you\u2019re traveling in Tokyo and need a little pick-me-up for yourself or want to put a smile on someone else\u2019s face, keep PRINT\u00d6NE\uff5ePB lab and Akihiro Nishino in mind.\n\nShop information\n\nPRINT\u00d6NE\uff5ePB lab\n\nAddress: Tokyo-to, Shibuya-ku, Udagawa-cho 24-2 Coast Shibuya Building\n\n\u6771\u4eac\u90fd\u6e0b\u8c37\u533a\u5b87\u7530\u5ddd\u753a24-2 \u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u6e0b\u8c37\u30d3\u30eb\n\nOpen: 11 a.m - 9 p.m.\n\nWebsite\n\nSource: @Press\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Kiki & Lala Cafe in Tokyo now serving up star shaped burgers and more!\u3010Photos\u3011\n\n-- Girls spotted crying in Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya neighborhood for a startling, invisible reason\n\n-- Awesome Tokyo cafe\u2019s less-than-a-buck beer is so cheap it\u2019s almost criminal\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/12/23/new-tokyo-fashion-store-has-free-coffee-thanks-to-a-kind-extremely-generous-charity-donations/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24"}}
