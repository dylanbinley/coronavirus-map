The suspension came at a time when negotiations on the building of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline were at an advanced stage. In addition, the Tilenga project had been pronounced technically ready for oil production.\n\nCapital gains tax\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Uganda Business Petroleum By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

Although details remain scanty, sources say no agreement was reached.\n\n\"We offered them a package which they have to consider then they get back to us. All parties are keen to move forward,\" Ms Muloni told The EastAfrican three days before the reshuffle.\n\nApparently, CNOOC and Total failed to align their positions with Uganda government over the $185 million capital gains tax equivalent to thirty per cent of $617 million which is overall investments by Tullow in the country's oil and gas sector.\n\nThe standoff affected the East African Crude Oil Pipeline and upstream operations at Tilenga in September following the unsuccessful sale of Tullow Oil's 21.57 shares.\n\nStaff layoffs\n\nTotal said it could not continue to spend money on technical teams when there was no clarity on the way forward.\n\nSince then the companies have been cutting down on its staff, while service providers who have been gearing up to take opportunities have their capital held up in projects.\n\n\"It is premature to say we could do this or that. We have the Tullow deal terminated it means we are back into a shareholder configuration where each of us owns 33.3 per cent. The deal is now in the past so, we need to sit together first as joint venture partners and discuss next steps before we speculate because anything can happen,\" said Pierre Jessua told The EastAfrican in an October interview."}}
