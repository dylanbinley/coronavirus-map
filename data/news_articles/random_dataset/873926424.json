A day earlier, Shah had said the NRC would be extended to the rest of the country.\n\nThe Bengal chief minister\u2019s meeting with the Union home minister came a day after she met Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\u201cIt is a constitutional obligation to meet the Prime Minister and the Union home minister. It is a constitutional prerogative\u2026. We have to work together,\u201d Mamata said.\n\nThe chief minister said she flagged several Assam-related NRC concerns.\n\n\u201cI handed him a letter highlighting that among the 19 lakh people excluded in the Assam NRC, there are many Bengali-speaking people. There are Hindi-speaking people, our Gorkha brothers and sisters, and some local Assamese too. Genuine voters who have been excluded should get an opportunity in a manner that they should feel they are very much Indian,\u201d Mamata told journalists outside North Block.\n\n\u201cThere are Hindus and Muslims\u2026. We have said those whose names have been excluded should be included immediately. They are living in uncertainty\u2026. Hum mitti mein kaam karte hain. Hum aasman mein kaam nahi karte hain. Mitti ke logon ko jo dikkat hai woh hum dekh lenge (We work on the ground and not in the skies. We see the difficulty people face on the ground and will take care of it),\u201d she added.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Left and the Congress had condemned Mamata\u2019s silence on the NRC during the meeting with Modi.\n\nAfter meeting Shah, Mamata said: \u201cI told him our country is for people speaking all languages and everyone\u2026. Whoever is Indian should not be disturbed.\u201d\n\nShah had said on Wednesday that he was against the imposition of Hindi but advocated a common second language, besides the mother tongue.\n\nMamata added: \u201cAmi mone kori jara Bharotiyo tader notun kore poradhin howar kono karon neyi (I believe those who are Indian should not be colonised again).\u201d\n\nAsked if the NRC was discussed in connection with Bengal, Mamata said: \u201cNo\u2026. The home minister said nothing about the NRC in Bengal and I spoke to him only about Assam.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur stand is clear that there is no need for NRC in Bengal. Bihar chief minister Nitishji has also said there is no need for NRC in his state. So we discussed issues related to the Assam NRC only,\u201d she added.\n\nMamata said the NRC had created uncertainty in Assam and the Union home minister listened carefully to the concerns raised by her.\n\n\u201cHe heard me out carefully and I believe he will play a positive role\u2026. So many people are facing uncertainty in Assam. Where to stay? Where to go? I told him about digital ration card queues\u2026. It seems people are scared and terrorised as lakhs of people are standing in queues,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIn Bengal there are many borders as well. Bangladesh border, Bhutan border and Nepal border. There is also the Northeast gateway. Bengal has the chicken\u2019s neck and it\u2019s a very important place. Then there are the Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand borders. We discussed about all of that today,\u201d she added."}}
