On Tuesday, the Italian government announced a country-wide quarantine to combat the spread of the virus, affecting 60 million people. There are also growing cases in the United States. Currently, there are only 5 confirmed cases in New Zealand, and while there are no drastic quarantine measures yet in place, the whole Victoria University community is feeling the effects directly.\n\nLast week, Salient talked about how a travel ban imposed on mainland China prevented over 500 international students from starting their studies. VUW told Salient that \u201cthe University may have losses of up to $12 million this year, with financial impact flowing into subsequent years\u201d.\n\nThe university is striving to support these absentee students \u201cwith recorded and Zoom lectures and other forms of online engagement\u201d. The University will also be \u201csupplementing its course offerings in Trimester 2 and 3 to enable new entry points for students affected by the ban\u201d. Whether they choose to return is another question.\n\nThe loss of tuition fees remains a huge issue, apparently to be remedied largely through austerity measures and layoffs at our university, whose \u201cstaff\u2026is already stretched from budget cuts last year\u2014workloads are unsustainable.\u201d\n\nSo says Dougal McNeill, co-president of the Victoria University branch of the Tertiary Education Union (TEU).\n\n\u201cThere is no case for cuts\u2026cuts and job losses are a short-term response that will do long-term damage,\u201d he said in a TEU press release last week.\n\n\u201cWe are in this job because we care about students. We want the best for them. A learning environment with less staff\u2026will be bad for all of us.\u201d\n\nVUW staff heard about proposed redundancies not directly from their Vice-Chancellor Grant Guilford, but through the media. \u201c[VUW] is a deeply unhappy workplace,\u201d McNeill told Salient. \u201cThe Vice-Chancellor\u2019s comments to the media have made an already demoralised environment even worse. We are appalled.\u201d\n\nVUWSA CEO Matthew Tucker sees it from a student perspective.\n\n\u201cLack of public funding in the tertiary sector means that it is not just international students who will experience the negative impact of the travel ban,\u201d Tucker told Salient. \u201cThis ban...will lead to courses being axed and staff losing their jobs. This will undermine the experience that all students\u2014domestic and international\u2014pay thousands of dollars for.\u201d\n\nVUWSA provides advocacy services for any students that need help or support.\n\nThe hiring freeze announced at the end of February was described as an \u201cinterim measure\u201d by Mr. Guilford. He told Salient that \u201cuniversities are often impacted by external factors such as changes in student preferences, reduced government funding and events such as earthquakes and epidemics. Vice-Chancellors do their best to minimise the negative impacts of such events on staff, students, and institutional sustainability\u201d.\n\nMr. Guilford said that the university will also set up a \u201chardship fund\u201d for affected international students, which would grant the student an unspecified dollar amount of aid for things like missed flights and course fees. He was at the same time unable to confirm how many people, if any, will be affected by the upcoming layoffs. There may be some financial juggling to be done.\n\nTEU National President Michael Gilchrist makes an interesting point when he observes in a press release that \u201cit is ironic that once again staff feature as pawns in the power games of vice-chancellors...there are many other ways in which the impact of the travel ban could be buffered.\u201d\n\nSalient appreciates the fact that there is no easy solution to this crisis of the missing funds. We would hope that whatever is decided, the quality of the experience and education received at VUW remains at the high level to which we have become accustomed."}}
