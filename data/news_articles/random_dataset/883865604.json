Journalists, social media users and protesters have been accused of \u201cterrorism\u201d and subjected to criminal investigation, arbitrary detention and travel bans. If prosecuted and found guilty, they could face lengthy prison sentences.\n\n\u201cAs the tanks rolled across the Syrian border, the government took the opportunity to launch a domestic campaign to eradicate dissenting opinions from media, social media and the streets. Critical discussion on issues of Kurdish rights and politics has become even further off limits,\u201d said Amnesty International\u2019s Europe Director, Marie Struthers.\n\n\u201cLanguage around the military incursion was heavily policed, and hundreds of people who expressed their dissenting opinions about Turkey\u2019s military operation were rounded up and are facing investigations under anti-terrorism laws.\u201d\n\nSilencing of journalists\n\nOn October 10, a day after the offensive began, Turkey\u2019s broadcasting regulatory body (RT\u00dcK) warned media outlets that there would be zero tolerance of \u201cany broadcasting that may negatively impact the morale and motivation of [\u2026] soldiers or may mislead citizens through incomplete, falsified or partial information that serves the aims of terror.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, two journalists were detained. Hakan Demir of the daily newspaper Birg\u00fcn was questioned over a tweet on the paper\u2019s official Twitter account based on an NBC report stating that \u201cTurkish warplanes have started to carry out airstrikes on civilian areas.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Fatih G\u00f6khan Diler, managing editor of the Diken news website, was detained after publication of an article with the headline \u201cSDF claim: two civilians lost their lives.\u201d Both journalists were accused of \u201cinciting enmity and hatred\u201d before being released with overseas travel bans pending the outcome of criminal investigations.\n\nPolice also burst into the home of journalist and human rights defender, Nurcan Baysal, at 5 a.m. on October 19. She told Amnesty International: \u201cHaving my home raided and my children terrorized by 30 heavily armed, masked police officers simply for some social media posts calling for peace, shows the level of suppression of freedom of expression in Turkey.\u201d\n\nJournalist \u00d6zlem Oral was detained on the same day and questioned over tweets criticizing \u2018Operation Peace Spring\u2019 which were posted on a Twitter account not even her own. She was released the next day with an overseas travel ban, required to regularly report at a local police station, and not to leave \u0130stanbul where she lives.\n\nOn October 27, lawyer and columnist Nurcan Kaya was detained at Istanbul airport for criticizing the offensive by tweeting \u201cWe know from experience how everything you call a peace operation is a massacre.\u201d She was released after questioning the same day, but received an international travel ban.\n\nIt is not just Turkish journalists that have been targeted. On October 25, President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s lawyers announced that they filed a criminal complaint against the director and editor of French magazine Le Point, following the publication of the October 24 issue which used the cover headline \u201cEthnic cleansing: the Erdo\u011fan method\u201d in its coverage of the military offensive. The lawyers claimed the cover is insulting to the president, a crime under Turkish law.\n\nTargeting of social media users\n\nIn the first week of the offensive alone, 839 social media accounts were under investigation for \u201csharing criminal content\u201d with 186 people reportedly taken into police custody and 24 remanded in pre-trial detention, according to official figures.\n\nOne social media user, who was detained and accused of \u201cpropaganda for a terrorist organization\u201d had retweeted three tweets, one of which read: \u201cRojava [the autonomous Kurdish area in northern Syria] will win. No to War.\u201d Like others, these tweets did not come remotely close to constituting evidence of an internationally recognizable crime.\n\nHe was given an overseas travel ban and required to report to a local police station twice a month. One lawyer told Amnesty International: \u201cUsing the words \u2018war\u2019, \u2018occupation\u2019, \u2018Rojava\u2019 has become a crime. The judiciary says \u2018you cannot say no to war\u2019.\u201d\n\nTargeting of politicians and activists\n\n\u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d has also been used by the government as a pretext to escalate its crackdown on opposition politicians and activists. Several MPs are currently subject to criminal investigations including Sezgin Tanr\u0131kulu, who is facing a criminal probe for comments he made in the media, and a tweet which read: \u201cGovernment needs to know this, this is an unjustified war and a war against the Kurds.\u201d\n\nAccording to lawyers from the Bar Association in \u015eanl\u0131urfa province, at least 54 people were taken into police custody in the province by counter-terrorism officers on October 9 and 10. Among them were members of the Kurdish-rooted leftist opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (HDP), as well as members of left-wing opposition trade unions.\n\nWithin the first week of the military offensive at least 27 people, many of whom were affiliated with HDP, were detained in Mardin province on terrorism-related charges. Detainees included the elected mayor of the town of Nusaybin. The government later replaced her with the unelected district governor.\n\nOn October 12 the Saturday Mothers, relatives of victims of enforced disappearances who have been holding peaceful vigils every Saturday since 2009 to remember their loved ones, were warned by police that they would break up the vigil \u201cif they utter the word \u2018war\u2019.\u201dThe peaceful gathering was violently broken up as soon as the statement that criticized the military operation was read out.\n\n\u201cSince the start of the military offensive, Turkey\u2019s already entrenched atmosphere of censorship and fear has deepened, with detentions and trumped-up charges used to silence the few who dare to utter any challenge or criticism of \u2018Operation Peace Spring\u2019,\u201d said Marie Struthers.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish authorities must stop gagging opinions they don\u2019t like and end the ongoing crackdown. All charges and prosecutions of those targeted for peaceful expression of their opposition to Turkey\u2019s military operations should be immediately dropped.\u201d"}}
