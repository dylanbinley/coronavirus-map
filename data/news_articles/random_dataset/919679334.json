Critics say the 64-year-old, who was awarded China\u2019s most prestigious literary prize in 2010, is providing fodder to countries that have slammed Beijing\u2019s handling of the pandemic.\n\nFang began to document life in Wuhan, the city of 11 million where COVID-19 first emerged in December, after it was placed under an unprecedented lockdown on January 23. As authorities desperately scrambled to stop the disease from spreading across the country, she wrote about the fears, anger and hope of the industrial hub\u2019s residents in isolation.\n\nIn one entry she mentioned seeing pictures of the city\u2019s empty East Lake, and the \"deserted and peaceful expanse of the water\". She described residents helping each other, and the simple pleasure of the sun lighting up her room.\n\nBut she also touched on politically sensitive topics such as overcrowded hospitals turning away patients, mask shortages and relatives\u2019 deaths. \"A doctor friend said to me: in fact, we doctors have all known for a while that there is a human-to-human transmission of the disease, we reported this to our superiors, but yet nobody warned people,\" she wrote in one entry.\n\nBorn to a family of well-off intellectuals, the writer\u2019s real name is Wang Fang but she uses the pen name Fang Fang. Readers flocked to the online diary to get an unfiltered account from Wuhan in a Communist-ruled country that lacks independent media.\n\nBut some social media users have turned on the author -- especially as a new diplomatic spat has erupted between China and the US, which accuses Beijing of a lack of transparency in the outbreak\u2019s early days, costing the world valuable time.\n\n\"Bravo Fang Fang. You\u2019re giving Western countries ammunition to target China,\" said one post about her on the country\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo platform. \"You\u2019ve shown your treacherous nature,\" it said.\n\nAnother accused Fang of making money off Wuhan\u2019s nearly 4,000 virus victims, writing: \"How much did you sell the diary for?\" Hit by a barrage of online insults, Fang wrote on Weibo that she was the victim of \"cyberbullying\" by fringe nationalists. And in an interview posted on the website of Chinese weekly Caixin, the author said she had received death threats and that her home address was posted online."}}
