Still, Trump isn\u2019t going to let something as insignificant as legality stop him from making big promises in exchange for campaign help! The emails say this nonexistent task force \u201cwill be made up only of President Trump\u2019s most LOYAL supporters, the ones committed to fighting for him, reelecting him, and taking back the House.\u201d\n\nIn another email sent out today, he pushed the old \u201cwitch hunt\u201d standby, saying, \u201cI\u2019VE DONE NOTHING WRONG. TRUST ME, YOU SAW THE TRANSCRIPT.\u201d That\u2019s a bold statement, and one that seems to be banking really hard on the assumption that few of Trump\u2019s supporters have actually taken the time to read the transcript memo\u2014Trump hates reading, so why would anyone else do it?\u2014because that is absolutely not what it says.\n\nTrump tells supporters in a new fundraising email: \u201cI\u2019VE DONE NOTHING WRONG. TRUST ME, YOU SAW THE TRANSCRIPT.\u201d pic.twitter.com/T2CB9rA1fD \u2014 Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) September 25, 2019\n\nOver on his own Twitter page, Trump posted a video showing a supercut of a bunch of Democrats saying they want to impeach Trump, along with the laughable statement that \u201cWhile Democrats\u2019 \u2018sole focus\u2019 is fighting Trump, President Trump is fighting for you.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, rightwing news outlets seem to be scrambling to come up with some sort of spin to make the entire impeachment/memo story more palatable.\n\nInfoWars doesn\u2019t really have their talking points together on the transcript yet. Still stuck on calling Greta Thunberg Hitler, and also E-Verify for some reason. pic.twitter.com/IMZS6NTRsB \u2014 Ben Collins (@oneunderscore__) September 25, 2019\n\nBreitbart doesn\u2019t have their defense to the memo yet, either. This is a straight readout, but they focus on the Crowdstrike part of the memo. Since this mess started with Breitbart editor Peter Schweitzer\u2019s dig into Hunter Biden, I\u2019d guess they\u2019ll lead the way on talking points. pic.twitter.com/jZva47ES2j \u2014 Ben Collins (@oneunderscore__) September 25, 2019\n\nBy the way, if you\u2019re wondering (like I was) what would happen to these newly raised campaign funds were Trump\u2019s Defense Task Force to fail and he were to actually get impeached and removed from office, campaign finance law allows a candidate who drops out of a race (and, presumably, one who is forced to leave office, as well) to donate the remainder of their campaign fund to a charity.\n\nNow, the Donald J. Trump Foundation would seem like the obvious choice for that money, but it shut down earlier this year thanks to allegations that Trump was using it for personal and political gain. The Eric Trump Foundation (which has also been accused of similar misappropriations of funds) also shut down back in 2016. I wonder if any of the other Trumps happen to have plans to coincidentally establish their own charities in the coming months. I guess we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\n\n(image: Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nWant more stories like this?
