Members of their legislative committee have traveled to Idaho to speak with transportation planners and law enforcement officials about the law (which has been on the books there since the 1980s without incident). The BTA\u2019s legislative team has also spent countless hours working the Salem offices of our state legislators answering their questions and clearing up their confusions about the proposed law.\n\nThen, in one fell swoop, the largest media outlet in the entire state can pen a story that pans the idea \u2014 and it\u2019s not even on the editorial page.\n\nStory continues below\n\nadvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what seems to have happened today with an article in The Oregonian by their Salem-based political reporter Harry Esteve. His story, Nevermind that stop sign, just roll through \u2014 which ran below-the-fold on the front page of the Metro Section \u2014 has already triggered some heated comments on their website.\n\nSeveral people have already emailed me about the story, shocked at the level of editorializing and bias they feel it presents. In his opening line Esteve writes,\n\nCyclists would be able to ride \u2014 slowly \u2014 through stop signs with impunity under a bill up for discussion tomorrow at the Legislature.\n\n\u201cWith impunity\u201d is the type of phrase that is sure to make the BTA cringe. And then the article goes on:\n\nAnd you\u2019re scratching your head wondering when was the last time you saw one actually stop.\n\nOuch. I had to double-check to see if Esteve\u2019s story was an editorial after reading that (it\u2019s not).\n\nEsteve then goes on to point out how all the bill sponsors are \u201cserious cyclists\u201d. He then gets a quote from a spokesperson for the Police Bureau who says (not unexpectedly) that \u201cWe need everyone to obey these laws\u201d.\n\nI was surprised to read this quote from Ms. Wheat. Bryan Parman, acting Captain of the Police Bureau Traffic Division has told the city\u2019s Bicycle Advisory Committee that they have no position on the matter.\n\nThis one story is far from enough to kill this bill, but laws are just as much about politics as policy. If enough legislators feel like the politics around this idea are too hot (or if they haven\u2019t heard a resounding level of support for it from constituents), the Idaho Stop Law might have trouble passing.\n\nSuffice it to say that the media\u2019s coverage is almost certain to play a role in how this turns out.\n\n\n\nRead the entire article here.\n\nStay tuned for more on this bill. I\u2019m headed to Salem to report from the committee hearing.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nMore local media coverage today:\n\n\u2013 KGW\n\n\u2013 KATU \u2013 This story has a completely erroneous opening sentence. It states that:\n\n\u201cIt could soon be completely legal for cyclists to run stop signs and stoplights here in Oregon.\u201d\n\nThe BTA\u2019s Idaho law proposal says nothing about stoplights. Hopefully that story is corrected soon. KATU has corrected their story, unfortunately their uncorrected story has been picked up by other outlets in the state. KVAL in Eugene is still running the incorrect story as of 8:00 on Weds night (3/18).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront Page, Legislation, Media, News, Politics\n\n2009 legislative session, idaho stop law, the oregonian"}}
