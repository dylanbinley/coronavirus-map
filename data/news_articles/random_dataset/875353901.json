With the most recent polls showing Trump is supported by 8 in 10 Republican voters or more, any GOP lawmaker who abandons him could well inspire a primary challenge that might be tough to survive.\n\n\u201cIf you support impeachment and they don\u2019t, you\u2019re signing your own death warrant,\u201d said Republican consultant Glen Bolger, referring to GOP lawmakers and hardcore Trump supporters.\n\nIf the evidence is incriminating enough, standing by Trump could jeopardize support from moderate voters come the 2020 general election. While most congressional Republicans represent safely GOP areas, those from swing districts and states can ill afford to anger such constituents.\n\n\u201cVery few things animate the base of both political parties like an impeachment discussion,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nAn impeachment effort could help Republican candidates from GOP-leaning states, but Republicans from predominantly Democratic states must \u201cfigure out how to navigate those waters,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans said there remained many unanswered questions about Trump\u2019s actions before impeachment becomes a real threat to his presidency.\n\nEven so, at least one Democrat was all but rubbing his hands together in anticipation of the difficult spot Republicans face.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re terrified,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said of his GOP colleagues. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to find a place to land where they can maintain their credibility and their loyalty (to Trump), but at some point you have to choose.\u201d\n\nThe White House released a rough summary Wednesday of Trump\u2019s July conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In it, Trump urged his counterpart to \u201clook into\u201d corrupt actions by Biden in Ukraine \u2014 of which there is no evidence.\n\nMost Republicans speaking to reporters showed no signs of wavering and said the summary\u2019s release didn\u2019t trouble them.\n\n\u201cIt confirms what I suspected. Democrats have an impeachment obsession,\u201d said Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t run into anyone yet with a cold foot,\u201d said Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., of his Republican colleagues.\n\nBut Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who has occasionally clashed with Trump, has been most openly critical of him. He called the summary \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d\n\nYet in a time when GOP lawmakers have learned to tread lightly when it comes to confronting Trump \u2014 many who have done so are no longer in Congress \u2014 some facing competitive reelections next year chose their words carefully.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the summary \u201craises a number of questions.\u201d She also cited the Senate\u2019s potential role in ultimately judging whether Trump, if impeached, should be expelled from office, saying she\u2019ll be \u201ca juror\u201d and doesn\u2019t want to be \u201cprejudging\u201d him.\n\nSen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., perhaps the Senate\u2019s most endangered Republican, said he favored having the Senate Intelligence Committee continue its investigation into Trump\u2019s talks with the Ukrainian president.\n\nAlan Fram and Andrew Taylor are Associated Press writers."}}
