The deceptively serene Sea of Cortez and Baja Calif. town of San Felipe become a battleground for the extinction of the vaquito, the world\u2019s smallest cetacean, and the capture of the totoaba fish, whose swim bladders are prized in China. Local fishermen earn $5,000 per fish and their bladders are then sold in Tijuana for $12,000 to $15,000. From there, they are exported to China, where they fetch prices anywhere from $20,000 to $100,000.\n\n\u201cMany of the Chinese store them as they would store gold,\u201d says Ladkani, 46. \u201cThey cook them in a soup. It\u2019s good for their skin. Instead of buying a Ferrari, they buy a bladder or two.\u201d\n\n\u201cSea of Shadows\u201d also explores scientists\u2019 efforts to treat the vaquita in captivity. Lurking beneath the Sea of Cortez is a series of nets that trap larger fish. Aboveground, the nets have their equivalent in Oscar Parra, whose murder of a member of the Mexican Navy is captured on camera.\n\nLadkani spoke to The Post from LA.\n\nHow did you become aware of the plight of the vaquita?\n\n[Executive producer] Leonardo DiCaprio has been involved with the vaquita for years. He met the president of Mexico. He called us and said, \u201cWe need a movie on the vaquita and I can open doors for you, if you\u2019re interested.\u201d All that was one phone call.\n\nWhat problems did you encounter while making the film?\n\nThis is the most dangerous film I\u2019ve ever been involved in. We went in thinking we were going to shoot a nature doc. As soon as we saw how the mafia and the cartels were taking control of the fishermen and that the Navy brought their warships, it didn\u2019t take [long] until we were being shot at. Bullets started richocheting off the walls of our boat. We had bodyguards and a big security company and changed locations often enough so that the cartel did not find out where we were.\n\nWhat is a swim bladder?\n\nThe fish fill them with air and gas and use them for buoyancy. They\u2019re used like a lung. The Chinese are crazy for them. The cartels are dealing in swim bladders instead of cocaine. In order to get it, they\u2019ll kill everything else.\n\nHow much does the vaquita weigh?\n\nI\u2019m a kilogram guy. I\u2019ll say 150 pounds.\n\nWhat are the nets made of?\n\nNylon. The fish swim and their gills get caught in the nylon string and they can\u2019t get back out again. Small species swim through them. They\u2019re only good for catching larger fish. Large whales, turtles.\n\nWhat is the Earth League?\n\nEarth League International is the only crime-investigating agency for the planet. They\u2019re all ex-CIA, ex-FBI and NSA. They\u2019re people with a heart for the planet and the skills of James Bond and they\u2019re using those skills to target the traffickers.\n\nDo you feel \u201cSea of Shadows\u201d has made an environmental impact and, if so, what?\n\nYes. We are right now at peak impact. The Mexican government is sending in troops, going after traffickers and establishing a zero-tolerance zone. This is also because we had four screenings at the United Nations at the invitation of Ivonne Higuero, the Secretary General of Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). There were reps from all the countries of the world. People were very emotional. Out of that screening, the UN threatened Mexico with a huge embargo in a year if they don\u2019t protect the vaquita.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what else to watch this week:\n\nThis Is Us | Tuesday, 9 p.m., NBC\n\nDeja (Lyric Ross) pushes the boundaries of Randall (Sterling K.
