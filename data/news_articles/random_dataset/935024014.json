(AP Photo/Berthier Mugiraneza)\n\nNAIROBI, Kenya (AP) \u2014 Burundian refugees in Tanzania say they fear being forced to return to their country now that a new president has taken power and invited them home.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Burundians fled during the bloody political turmoil that followed former President Pierre Nkurunziza\u2019s decision to seek a third term in 2015. Nkurunziza decided not to run again in May\u2019s election and died days later in what the government called a heart attack.\n\nNew President Evariste Ndayishimiye is now being watched closely for any breaks with his predecessor, whose rule slid into repression in its final years. At his swearing-in, Ndayishimiye declared that \u201cBurundians should feel free to speak out. Burundians should be able to listen to each other, but outsiders should not dictate what to do.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe invited all those in exile to return and build a new nation.\n\nShortly afterward, Tanzania\u2019s director of the department of refugees visited camps for Burundians in western Tanzania where close to 200,000 remain, refugees told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cHe carried one message: Go back to your country, there is peace now,\u201d refugees said.\n\nThey said the official, Sudi Mwakibasi, urged refugees to take up the new president\u2019s offer and go home and participate in the country\u2019s development.\n\nA coalition of refugees\u2019 human rights defenders denounced the Tanzanian official\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cWe are not assured by the new government team,\u201d said Leopold Sharangabo, the coalition\u2019s vice president. He noted the new appointment in Burundi of a prime minister, Alain Guillaume Bunyoni, who is under U.S. sanctions for his alleged role in rights abuses. He called the appointment an insult to refugees.\n\n\u201cThese people harassed us, killed us, tortured us and forced us into exile. How can we be asked to go back under their regime?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cThe danger we fled is still there,\u201d said another refugee, Apollinaire Makokwe.\n\nSharangabo accused Tanzanian authorities of destroying markets in the camps in past efforts to make people leave. Some refugees noted that a request from Tanzanian authorities is normally an order.\n\nEven before Burundi\u2019s change in power, Tanzania\u2019s President John Magufuli told refugees to go home, claiming the country had calmed. Tanzania\u2019s government later denied it was expelling refugees.\n\nA spokesman with the United Nations refugee agency in Tanzania, Edward Ogolla, said in an email that \u201cwe expect that there will be calls for refugees from Burundi to go back home from senior government officials in Tanzania and Burundi. UNHCR continues to stand by the position that all returns must be voluntary and the result of a free and informed choice by refugees.\u201d\n\nOgolla said the UNHCR will continue to facilitate the voluntary repatriation of Burundian refugees and that 85,396 have returned since September 2017."}}
