Even a couple of weeks ago, we were talking about the number of countries through whom the coronavirus had spread, being less than 50.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s well over 100 now and more are added every day. So as you see things move to a pandemic phase, then these are the sorts of measures you put in place and you do it at the right time.\u201d"}}
