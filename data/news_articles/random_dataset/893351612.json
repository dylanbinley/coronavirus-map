He says that when he reached New York on November 1, he realised his sitar had been damaged.\n\nHe has raised the issue with the airline \u2014 it was subsequently raised in parliament recently as well \u2014 but has not been able to get damages.\n\n\u201cI was obviously not flying to New York with a broken sitar, yet Air India is not taking responsibility,\u201d he says.\n\nOn December 9, the Ministry of Civil Aviation tweeted about the incident. It was raised in Rajya Sabha by nominated member, Sonal Mansingh, who is a dancer of Bharatnatyam and Odissi.\n\nThe Ministry said that Air India had investigated the issue by looking at CCTV footage. They said that from the footage it appears that their usual operating procedure to handle fragile items was followed.\n\nThey also said that no damage was reported to airport authorities. \u201cEvery effort is made that priceless belongings, like the instrument, are well taken care of,\u201d said their tweet.\n\nI thank @sonal_mansingh ji for speaking in @RajyaSabha about injustice of @airindiain breaking my Sitar.Shameful when they hide behind rules&say I should have reported it before exiting the airport.Are they suggesting I broke it?@MoCA_GoI @HardeepSPuri @AshwaniLohani @PMOIndia \u2014 Shubhendra Rao (@ShubhendraRao) December 9, 2019\n\n\n\nRao says that he was in New York to perform at an event at a Diwali mela in a Hindu temple. He and his wife, who is also a musician, were to perform together. He finally borrowed a sitar and managed the performance but \u201ca musician\u2019s instrument is such a personal thing. Its a relationship you build over years. To perform on a borrowed instrument is not comfortable.\u201d\n\nRao says that Air India\u2019s response has been outrageous and he is planning to take them to court as \u201ctons of artists continue to suffer at the hands of various airlines.\u201d\n\n\u201cMansingh is a representative of artists in parliament, being a dancer herself. So she made this representation about my issue,\u201d says Rao."}}
