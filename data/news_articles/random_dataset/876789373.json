The said contest is a wish-granting initiative by the fast-food chain, as per The Salem Reporter last Thursday, Sept. 26. Lachance told NBC-affiliate KGW on the same day that Marston wrote the foundation a letter about what the single mom was \u201cgoing through\u201d at the time.\n\nLachance revealed that aside from being her manager, Marston is also someone she considers a close friend who knows about some events in her life.\n\nBefore Marston entered her in the said contest, Lachance had been saving up for her own car. However, things did not go as planned, as the sum she had put aside was later stolen from her. She said the money totaled to about $2,000 (around P104,000).\n\nPrior to receiving the car, Lachance had to walk to and from her job every day. She told the news outlet that it takes about an hour each way, and described the daily walk as \u201cnot fun.\u201d Marston agreed that it was \u201cpretty scary at night.\u201d\n\nAside from working, she also has to raise her 8-year-old son, whom she lives with in a recovery home.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs to why Marston entered her in the contest, she said, \u201cI just really appreciate Crystal so much and seeing her struggle with things really got to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever want to see anyone struggle or go through a hard time,\u201d Marston added. \u201cI thought this would be a great way to help her and bring her spirits back up.\u201d Ryan Arcadio/NVG\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nCashier who walks 6 miles to work given a car by dealer\n\nStudent walks 20 miles in middle of night to make it to first day of work\n\nRead Next\n\nEDITORS' PICK\n\nMOST READ"}}
