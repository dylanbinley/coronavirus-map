She's also inheriting a huge decision: whether to pursue a death penalty prosecution in the city's biggest murder case.\n\nFederal prosecutors have also brought a litany of charges against Patrick Crusius, a 22-year-old from the Dallas suburb of Allen who authorities claim drove nearly 600 miles to target Hispanics; he allegedly posted a document online just before the shooting railing against immigrants and a \"Hispanic invasion of Texas.\" He\u2019s facing dozens of state and federal charges, including nearly two dozen counts of capital murder at the state level and 23 counts of hate crimes resulting in death and 23 involving an attempt to kill at the federal level.\n\nEsparza, the outgoing district attorney, said he would pursue the death penalty, while federal prosecutors have stated they would consider it upon conviction, but it\u2019s unclear which case will proceed first \u2014 and whether Crusius will be tried by both jurisdictions. Rosales said justice isn\u2019t likely to come soon because of the complexity of the case and the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t anticipate this case going to the trial [phase] until, I am guessing, between two to three years,\u201d she said.\n\nBefore the coronavirus pandemic put a stranglehold on local economies, including El Paso\u2019s, Esparza said he was \u201coffended\u201d at the suggestion that the county should sit back and let federal officials take the lead in Crusius' prosecution in order to save the county millions in prosecution costs.\n\n\u201cFunding should never have a barrier in this prosecution, so I can tell you I\u2019m not going to hand it off to the feds just because it\u2019s cheaper,\u201d Esparza said in February.\n\nThat was before the pandemic ravaged El Paso County and the rest of Texas. After sealing her victory in last month's runoff election, Rosales said letting the U.S. attorney\u2019s office prosecute Crusius first would make financial sense for El Paso.\n\n\"From a legal perspective, it would make more sense for the federal government to try the case first,\" she said, adding that the appeals process for federal cases is faster than state cases.\n\n\"If you\u2019re going to talk economics, then it would save the county of El Paso millions of dollars to try that case,\" Rosales added. She said it's too soon to make that determination, and she plans to discuss the situation with both the state and federal judges after she takes office.\n\nRosales said she must also consider whether the community \u2014 and especially the victims\u2019 families \u2014 should be forced to relive the tragedy twice during two separate trials.\n\n\u201cAs we approach the one year anniversary, it\u2019s going to be a very emotional time for these people,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it something that we really want to put the families through a second time?\u201d\n\nCrusius' attorneys have already raised the issue of his mental health and said he has \"lifelong neurological and mental disabilities,\u201d the Associated Press reported earlier this month. His lawyers said that should be taken into consideration when prosecutors consider what punishment they seek.\n\nDespite confessing to authorities that he was the gunman after his arrest the day of the shooting, Crusius has pleaded not guilty in both the state and federal cases. Federal prosecutors were scheduled to meet Thursday to discuss what punishment they would seek when the case moves forward. Defense attorney David Lane did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a emailed statement, John Bash, the U.S attorney for the Western District of Texas, said: \u201cI join all El Pasoans, all Texans, and all Americans in mourning those we lost that terrible day one year ago. And I pray for the continued healing of those who survived. My office will not relent in our pursuit of justice for the victims and our community.\u201d Bash declined to comment on any aspect of the prosecution.\n\nRobert Dunham, executive director of the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit think tank that analyzes the death penalty, said the case could be over quickly if prosecutors took the death penalty off the table.\n\n\u201cHow important is it to make a statement to take his life?\" he said. \"How important is it to do that to protect the public, which can be done just as effectively with a sentence of life [in prison] without parole?\u201d\n\nEarlier this month in the parking lot of the Walmart, where the shooting began before the gunman entered the store, El Pasoans had a range of thoughts on what the accused gunman's fate should be.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should get the death penalty,\u201d said Stephanie Cordova. \u201cHe needs to live so he can learn his lesson. What if he just wants to die?\u201d\n\nHer friend Joey Reynolds said that while he\u2019d usually agree with Cordova, the scale of the shooting and the number of lives lost justifies capital punishment.\n\n\u201cMy personal belief, I think he should [face the death penalty],\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of [images] were shown online and I think that got to a lot of the younger generation. It would be nice to have some finalization.\"\n\nDomingo Soledad Nu\u00f1ez, who was raised in Chihuahua Cityin northern Mexicobut has lived in El Paso for 20 years, said whether Crusius is executed or not won't make a difference in God's eyes.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say whether to kill him or lock him up for the rest of the life,\u201d he added. \u201cBut he was already dead inside when he did what he did.\u201d\n\nThe anniversary has already rekindled demands for action from lawmakers, especially Democrats who last year pleaded with Gov. Greg Abbott to call a special session of the Texas Legislature to address gun violence. Those calls grew louder after another mass shooting just weeks later in Midland that took eight lives, including the shooter's.\n\nThe El Paso shooting happened a day after Abbott's campaign sent out a mailer saying Texans would need to take matters into their \u201cown hands\u201d to \u201cdefend\u201d the border.\n\nAbbott later said he spoke to members of El Paso's legislative delegation and told them \u201cthat mistakes were made and course correction has been made,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cWe will make sure that we work collaboratively in unification.\u201d\n\nThe governor didn't call lawmakers back into session, instead opting for roundtable discussions in El Paso on gun violence.\n\nDuring a press call recently with Moms Demand Action,a national gun reform group with chapters across the country, U.S. Rep Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, said Texas Republicans who pushed for a special session on a transgender bathroom bill showed little interest in addressing what she called the more pressing issue of gun violence.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately we have yet to see any legislation taken up and really not much has changed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd as you can imagine, it is very frustrating not just for me, but I hear all the time from constituents \u2018What are you going to do about this?\u2019\u201d\n\nState Rep. Joe Moody, D-El Paso, said the state\u2019s Democratic caucus has had a long-standing request for a special session on gun violence since before the Walmart shooting. But he said he did come away with the feeling that the task forces formed after the shooting were able to create some momentum on how to move forward next session and address issues like strengthening background checks and ensuring that information provided to gun sellers by potential owners is accurate.\n\n\"The message I heard from the governor and from others was to build consensus around reform measures and then bring those forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI fully expect and anticipate that when we return, in whatever way it looks in January, that gun violence and community safety is going to be one of the major issues that is going to get tackled.\"\n\nAbbott spokesperson John Wittman said the El Paso shooting led to the creation of a domestic terrorism task force that recommended creating \"domestic terrorism teams\" comprised of Department of Public Safety special agents, as well as a \"state intelligence assessment on domestic terrorism threats in Texas.\"\n\nWittman said that the governor shares the city\u2019s grief and said lawmakers will act on other recommendations by the task force when lawmakers return to the Capitol next year.\n\n\u201cOur hearts forever remain with the victims, their families, and all those impacted by this senseless and hateful attack,\" he said in an email. \"As Texas prepares for the upcoming session, we seek justice for all those harmed in this tragedy by passing laws to combat domestic terrorism in Texas.\u201d\n\nThe city and county held events to commemorate the anniversary, including a drive-through candlelight vigil and a memorial at the city's history museum. Activist groups also held their own events. Fernando Garcia, the executive director of the El Paso-based Border Network for Human Rights, said his group marched to the Walmart from a nearby memorial service carrying 23 crosses.\n\n\"What is different from what we\u2019re doing and from the county and the city is doing is we\u2019re calling it what it was, white supremacy,\" he said. \"It was a racist attack against our community. It wasn\u2019t about mental health or about a disturbed individual. It was created by the hateful rhetoric by the president and others.\""}}
