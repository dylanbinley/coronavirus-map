It\u2019s been so hard for me, and also for other women who have also had to wait.\u201d\n\nSandra*, another sexual assault survivor from the NT, says she feels \u201crelieved\u201d and \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by today\u2019s news.\n\n\u201cThis gives me back a bit more freedom. It\u2019s been such a long journey and when you\u2019re sitting in a courtroom it doesn\u2019t feel like anything positive will ever come out of what you\u2019ve been through.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Sandra was raped at work, during a bucks night just outside of Darwin.\n\nThe offender was found guilty and sentenced to three years and six months jail, to be suspended after nine months. Sandra has been waiting to tell her story ever since.\n\n\u201cThe amount of times I\u2019ve wanted to write something on Facebook to explain to people what happened to me, my true feelings, and why I fell off the face of the earth ... but I couldn\u2019t even do that,\u201d she told news.com.au.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel even more isolated, like I was the bad one who did something wrong. So I\u2019m glad that other (sexual assault survivors) aren\u2019t going to have to worry about that anymore, when they should be worried about focusing on getting better.\u201d\n\nMichael Bradley, who represents both Adriana and Sandra, and is the managing partner of Marque Lawyers, says that the reform \u201crestores the balance to where it should be\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really rewarding working directly with the survivors along with End Rape On Campus to make this happen. This is a great day for survivors.\u201d\n\nGrace Tame, who became the first female sexual assault survivor ever to win the right to self-identify in Tasmania, said that she was thrilled that the #LetHerSpeak campaign had achieved \u201canother victory\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is a testament to the power of teamwork. This is what is achievable when we band together in support of one another,\u201d she said.\n\nThe NT Attorney-General, Natasha Fyles, praised those sexual assault survivors who wish to tell their stories.\n\n\u201cThe retelling of (survivor) stories no longer attracts the stigma of shame or embarrassment and can be an important part of the healing process \u2013 our legislative amendments are an important mechanism to allow survivors to do that.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know has been impacted by sexual violence, support is available by calling 1800 RESPECT on 1800 737 732.\n\nNina Funnell is the creator of the #LetHerSpeak campaign in partnership with news.com.au, NT News, The Mercury, Marque Lawyers and End Rape On Campus Australia.\n\nNina was awarded the 2020 Our Watch award by the Walkley Foundation for the #LetHerSpeak campaign."}}
