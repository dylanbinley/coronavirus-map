He says the review will be done by Nov. 15.\n\nThree major joint military drills were scrapped this year as part of a broader effort to push for diplomatic progress with North Korea.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis says he is not yet concerned about a loss of combat capability. He says they may have to make changes to make sure those capabilities aren\u2019t eroded, but so far it is not a worry.
