It was an area where random things were dropped or where guys were just wandering around. This would have been very marshy back in the period.\u201d\n\nShipley estimated he\u2019s made more than 100 visits to the Fleckenstein farm, located along state Route 66 just north of Fort Loramie. While the area south of Loramie Creek is largely devoid of artifacts, Wayne\u2019s Legion Research Group has uncovered evidence north of the creek of the trading post that Pierre-Louis de Lorimier constructed in 1769 and of Gen. Anthony Wayne\u2019s supply depot from the 1790s.\n\n\u201cThis is the most special site that I\u2019ve probably ever worked on,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve found thousands and thousands of things related to Lorimier\u2019s store and especially Gen. Wayne\u2019s supply depot right here.\u201d\n\nShipley has been part of archaeological expeditions for more than 40 years. He\u2019s been interested in archaeology since he was 6 years old and found an arrowhead on his family\u2019s farm north of Urbana.\n\nIn the past six or seven years, after retiring from his job as a quality coordinator for Honda, Shipley has spent more time on archaeology and started leading larger group projects such as the Fort Loramie expedition that began in the fall of 2013.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been a real interesting opportunity to study one of these really early United States Army military outposts,\u201d Shipley said.\n\nNo professional archaeological groups have examined the Fleckenstein property so Wayne\u2019s Legion Research Group has undertaken the project, hoping to learn more about an historic period of national expansion. The group includes approximately 20 members and is entirely self-funded.\n\n\u201cWe just get together and do these basically out of pocket with our own time,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we have an interest in it.\u201d\n\nIn the past six years, the Fort Loramie excavation has uncovered 400 military buttons, thousands of musket balls, gun flints, gun parts, buckles and many more objects discarded by the Legion of the United States. The Legion, often termed Wayne\u2019s Legion, was the United States\u2019 army from 1792 to 1796, tasked with asserting U.S. sovereignty in the region.\n\nSouth of Loramie Creek, the only evidence of Wayne\u2019s Legion the researchers uncovered in their first 80 foot by 40 foot excavation plot was a uniform button and a buckshot pellet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just neat to see the history come back out of the ground,\u201d said Carl Stuard, of Arlington, holding a buckshot pellet he found.\n\nWayne established a supply depot near present-day Fort Loramie, a valuable site because of its proximity to Loramie Creek and the St. Marys River \u2013 waterways used in transporting military supplies.\n\nPrior to the military presence, the property was the site of Lorimier\u2019s trading post from 1769 until 1782. Lorimier, a native French-Canadian, had supported British and Native American raids against the growing American presence in the region. The trading post was destroyed as part of a campaign against the Shawnee led by George Rogers Clark and Benjamin Logan.\n\n\u201cWe found quite a few fire pits, trash pits and actually post molds from where George Rogers Clark and Ben Logan burned down Lorimier\u2019s trading post over there,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cWe found the burnt post molds of where the store was over in the other field right north of us.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s rare to find an undisturbed trash pit like Wayne\u2019s Legion Research Group did in 2016, Shipley said. The pit provided evidence of what the Legion of the United States ate including beef bones, deer bones, turkey spurs and wild boar tusks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve actually found one or two bear teeth, which is really cool thinking they were totting a big black bear or something in the 1790s back into camp,\u201d Shipley said.\n\nTo find relics from the earliest days of the United States, Shipley and his team clear the top layer of soil from their excavation sites. The top layer of dirt, referred to as the plow zone, is largely devoid of artifacts as farmers and treasure hunters have already picked up items near the surface.\n\n\u201cPeople were actually picking up relics behind horses when they used to plow these fields with horses in the 1800s,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cThere was a wonderful pipe tomahawk found on this site back in the very beginning of the 1900s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine what was being found back in the early days when you were behind a horse or a mule or turning it over with a one-bottom plow. You\u2019d have been getting gun barrels and knives and everything up out of the ground just to get them out of your way because it wasn\u2019t anything interesting to those people back in those days. It was just in his way.\u201d\n\nSome items have settled below the plow zone including buttons from the uniforms of Wayne\u2019s Legion. The soldiers wore their uniforms to shreds, Shipley said, and documents state that Wayne complained that the uniforms were substandard.\n\n\u201cThe Fallen Timbers campaign of 1794 and then the Treaty of Greenville that was signed in 1775, by the time that period was over those clothes had worn out and fallen apart,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cSo virtually all the Wayne\u2019s Legion buttons ever created are here in the western part of Ohio.\n\n\u201cA lot of these buttons, it just makes you cry they weren\u2019t found 10 or 20 years ago because they\u2019re just falling apart now. That pewter can\u2019t take it much longer laying in this ground.\u201d\n\nWayne\u2019s Legion Research Group is trying to save the artifacts that remain in the ground and document its findings so people can better understand the lives of the people who left them behind.\n\nShipley has made presentations with some of the items discovered at Fort Loramie, but ultimately they\u2019re all returned to the Fleckenstein family.\n\n\u201cEverything we find stays together,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cWe clean it. I catalog it, photograph it.\u201d\n\nLinda Fleckenstein, watching the researchers from a lawn chair at the edge of her family\u2019s field, said it\u2019s been amazing to see the items that still are discovered hundreds of years after they were lost or discarded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I never thought I would sit out here in the hot sun with an umbrella in the middle of a field watching them dig.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the discoveries in Fort Loramie and elsewhere, visit Shipley\u2019s Facebook page at www.facebook.com/greg.shipley.756.\n\nGreg Shipley searches for evidence of the Legion of the United States on the Fleckenstein farm, located along state Route 66 just north of Fort Loramie. https://www.sidneydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/47/2019/10/web1_IMGP0943.jpg Greg Shipley searches for evidence of the Legion of the United States on the Fleckenstein farm, located along state Route 66 just north of Fort Loramie.
