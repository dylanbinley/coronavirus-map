China's arrests of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and subsequent allegations of spying are widely seen as attempts by China to pressure Canada to release Meng.\n\nHer lawyers have accused U.S. President Donald Trump of poisoning the extradition case against Meng with his interference and attempt to use her as a \"bargaining chip\" in the trade dispute between the U.S. and China.\n\nThe documents released Friday will be used during the committal hearing planned for April 2021.\n\nBefore that, there will be other legal arguments, including a hearing next February where Meng's lawyers will argue that she was subject to an abuse of process during her arrest in December 2018.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 31, 2020."}}
