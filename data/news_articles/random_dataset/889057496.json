The action involves lecturers, student support services staff, admissions tutors, librarians, technicians and administrators.\n\nHundreds of strikers mounted picket lines at university campuses at 63 institutions around the UK. The University and College Union (UCU) said 43,600 members were involved in the stoppage after voting in two separate ballots to oppose the plans of Universities UK (UUK).\n\nThe walkout involves workers at almost half the universities in Britain, including University College London, Goldsmiths College, Queen Mary University of London, Courtauld Institute of Art, the Open University, University of Manchester, University of Leeds, University of Sheffield, University of Bristol and University of Glasgow.\n\nStudents and lecturers march in solidaity in Manchester\n\nEverything was done by university management to intimidate strikers. According to the Financial Times, \u201cBirmingham said picket lines on university land would be regarded as trespassing.\u201d Some universities said that striking staff would be docked pay and pension contributions. Staff, including those who were not UCU members, were told by Lancaster and Stirling universities that their pay would be deducted if they did not cross picket lines.\n\nDespite picket lines in many cities being even larger than in last year\u2019s well supported strike against pension cuts, Universities UK claimed that less than 10 percent of staff were on strike. Rallies were held, including in Manchester, Bristol and Newcastle, that were attended by hundreds of strikers.\n\nAround a million students are impacted by the strike, with many showing their support for academics on picket lines and at rallies.\n\nIn the days leading up to the strikes a number of universities threatened students with disciplinary action if they refused to cross picket lines of their tutors and other university staff. The University of Liverpool warned international students that those who did not cross picket lines risked jeopardising their visas to study in the UK.\n\nStudents refused to be intimidated, not only refusing to cross picket lines in many cases but also joining in marches held during the day and sending delegations to rallies held by strikers.\n\nIn response to the threats at Liverpool, seven external examiners to the university\u2019s school of law and social justice resigned. They said the threats amounted to a \u201cweaponization of the UK\u2019s immigration system\u201d and insisted that students supporting a picket line was \u201centirely lawful.\u201d\n\nOn the eve of the strike, the Office for Students\u2014the higher education watchdog\u2014said that students had a right as \u201cconsumers\u201d to have their education protected. Trying to encourage a right-wing movement against their tutors\u2014including taking legal action against them\u2014it said that students had entered into \u201ccontractual arrangements\u201d with their universities. If these are breached, students could \u201cexplore legal options.\u201d\n\nThe UCU has a long record of refusing to fight the onslaught of university and college management over the last decade, which has only emboldened management to go further on the offensive.\n\nUniversity staff and students picketing at UCL\n\nFollowing last year\u2019s national pension strike at 64 institutions by 50,000 lecturers and other university staff\u2014which the UCU ended after first trying to impose a shoddy deal\u2014and then accepting token promises by management to review the entire pension set-up, the universities are insisting that employees pay in additional tens of thousands of pounds to fund their own pensions! A typical member of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) is set to lose up to \u00a3240,000 in retirement\u2014a loss of around \u00a3200,000 from a year ago.\n\nThe UCU capitulated again on the first day of the strike as they accepted management deducting strikers\u2019 pay. Rather than oppose such draconian moves, the UCU proposed that any docked pay be staggered over more than a single month.\n\nOpposed to mobilising the collective strength of its membership in higher and further education\u2014that still stands at more than 120,000 workers\u2014the UCU is working overtime to end the dispute and go back into talks with UUK. The UCU called on employers to launch a new round of negotiations and to pull back from \u201cstrong-arm\u201d tactics. The union issued a statement Monday declaring, \u201cWe agree with [Labour Party shadow education secretary] Angela Rayner that universities should be putting students first and coming back to us with a better offer to try and avoid further disruption.\u201d\n\nLabour claims to oppose the \u201cmarketized system\u201d in education, which has resulted in the intolerable conditions that many university staff now endure, despite Corbyn\u2019s party having played a central role in this development. The marketization of higher education began with the introduction and later tripling of tuition fees by Labour in 1998 and 2004.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell issued only token tweets of solidarity to the strikers. Trades Union Congress leader Frances O\u2019Grady also tweeted in support of university staff \u201cstanding up for decent pay, pensions and conditions. Our whole movement is standing with you.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the strikers\u2019 rally in Manchester, Kate Green, the incumbent MP and Labour candidate for the Greater Manchester constituency of Stretford and Urmston, exposed the hyperbole of Rayner, Corbyn and McDonnell, as she underscored Labour\u2019s acceptance of the fact that universities are being forced to compete against other global institutions.\n\nDescribing the University of Manchester as a \u201cworld class success,\u201d Green said, \u201cEveryone knows that our university sector is facing fierce international competition and universities like Manchester, the jewels in the crown of our university sector, have to be protected, have to be grown to ensure that we retain our place as one of the premier destinations in the world for students and academics to come.\u201d\n\nDennis Leech at the University of Manchester as strikers and students prepare to march down Oxford Road to a rally\n\nSocialist Equality Party general election candidates Thomas Scripps and Dennis Leech spoke to strikers and students in London and Manchester.\n\nSpeaking at the University of Manchester, Leech explained, \u201cThe Socialist Equality Party are here today in support of thousands of strikers who are taking action across Britain against cuts in wages, their conditions of work and attacks on pensions. Last year, UCU members across the UK voted down a sell-out deal that was being imposed by the union leadership. This rejection had mass support from union members at mass meetings across the UK.\u201d\n\nAt University College London, Scripps stated, \u201cThis is a hugely important strike. Those on strike are taking a stand against the marketisation of higher education, which has transformed this sector from a public service, to high-price-tag students and property speculation founded on an insecure, underpaid and unprotected workforce.\n\nThomas Scripps at University College London\n\n\u201cThe main question in this struggle is the role of the higher education unions. The UCU called off strikes in 2011, 2015 and 2018 to pave the way for attacks on pensions, to raising members\u2019 contributions and for the raising of the retirement age.\n\n\u201cThe crucial question now for workers is the formation of independent committees in their universities. These committees should decide on their needs in terms of conditions, pay and pensions, the needs of higher education staff for secure employment and a secure family life. These action committees should co-ordinate strike action to win those demands and reach out to the entire workforce for their support in the struggle.\u201d\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."}}
