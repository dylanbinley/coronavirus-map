I intend Bowalley Road to be a much quieter, and certainly a more respectful, place.\n\nSo, if you wish your comments to survive the moderation process, you will have to follow the Bowalley Road Rules.\n\nThese are based on two very simple principles:\n\nCourtesy and Respect.\n\nComments which are defamatory, vituperative, snide or hurtful will be removed, and the commentators responsible permanently banned.\n\nAnonymous comments will not be published. Real names are preferred. If this is not possible, however, commentators are asked to use a consistent pseudonym.\n\nComments which are thoughtful, witty, creative and stimulating will be most welcome, becoming a permanent part of the Bowalley Road discourse.\n\nHowever, I do add this warning. If the blog seems in danger of being over-run by the usual far-Right suspects, I reserve the right to simply disable the Comments function, and will keep it that way until the perpetrators find somewhere more appropriate to vent their collective spleen.\n\n"}}
