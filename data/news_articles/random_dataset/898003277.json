events to be included in UN Secretary-General\u2019s report", "TEXT": "President of Cyprus Nicos Anastasiades said that he anticipated significant events \u201cwhich fully justify extending the presence of the peacekeeping force in Cyprus\u201d would be included in the upcoming UN Secretary-General\u2019s report on UNFICYP.\n\n\n\nPresident Anastasiades received on Thursday morning Elizabeth Spehar, the UN Secretary-General`s Special Representative in Cyprus and Head of UNFICYP, in the presence of close associates and officials.\n\n\n\nWhile departing from the Presidential Palace, President Anastasiades said that he had a very useful and constructive meeting with Spehar, that aimed at reviewing developments taking place in Cyprus during this period.\n\nHe also said that ahead of UNFICYP\u2019s mandate renewal, he touched upon some issues \u201cthat certainly need to be included in the report\u201d to portray events objectively.\n\n\n\n\u201cI believe that at least the significant events affecting the whole situation in Cyprus will be included, which fully justify extending the presence of the peacekeeping force in Cyprus\u201d the President said.\n\n\n\nInvited to comment on developments in the region, following the confrontation between Iran and the US, President Anastasiades expressed hope that wiser thoughts will prevail, in order to avoid a new bloodshed that will affect not just the region, but also Europe as a whole, the global economy and the region\u2019s stability.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to journalists after the meeting, Spehar said that she had a good meeting with President Anastasiades, briefing him on her upcoming trip to New York and Washington.\n\n\n\nThe UN official said that she departs for the United States on Saturday, where a Security Council session on UNFICYP is coming up soon, based on the Secretary-General\u2019s report. \u201cThat is scheduled presently for the 20th January\u201d she added.\n\n\n\nSpehar noted moreover that the Secretary-General\u2019s report should be out in the next couple of days.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, she said that she is also going to Washington to touch base with officials at the State Department as well as in Congress and the National Security Council.\n\n\n\nIn New York she said that she will be meeting with senior UN officials, as well as Security Council members and member states who are troop contributors or police contributors to UNFICYP.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am looking forward to a good trip during which I hope to have substantive discussions with all of my interlocutors about the situation on the ground and the role of the peace keeping force in Cyprus and look forward to their discussions on UNFICYP\u2019s mandate renewal\u201d she concluded.\n\n\n\nAsked if there are any updates concerning the Cyprus settlement process after last November\u2019s tripartite meeting in Berlin, between the UN Secretary-General and the Cyprus leaders, Spehar said that there are no updates for the moment.\n\n\n\nOn another question, about the possibility of Jane Holl Lute, the UN Secretary-General\u2019s envoy to Cyprus, returning to the island, Spehar said that there is nothing scheduled for the moment to her knowledge.\n\n\n\nAs CNA learns, during the meeting President Anastasiades listed the points he anticipates to be included in the Secretary-General\u2019s report, with the Greek Cypriot side not expecting any \u201cunpleasant surprises\u201d regarding UNFICYP\u2019s mandate renewal.\n\nNo discussion was made in relation to the next steps concerning the Cyprus issue, with developments expected after the \u201celections\u201d in the Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus, in Spring.\n\n\n\nCyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey invaded and occupied its northern third. Repeated rounds of UN-led peace talks have so far failed to yield results. The latest round of negotiations, in July 2017 at the Swiss resort of Crans-Montana ended inconclusively."}}
