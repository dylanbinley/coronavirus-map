Republicans in Washington are trying to take it away,\" Whitmer said in her speech.\n\nShe spoke about health care in personal terms, describing how she had fought against an insurance company after her mother was \"wrongly denied her coverage for chemotherapy.\"\n\nWhitmer also made an economic appeal, saying, \"American workers are hurting. ... Wages have stagnated, while CEO pay has skyrocketed.\"\n\nWhite House officials had said Trump would stress a strong US economy in his remarks Tuesday night. Taking on the President directly, Whitmer said, \"It doesn't matter what the President says about the stock market.
