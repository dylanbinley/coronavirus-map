Trump, with committing high crimes and misdemeanors.\u2019\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said, \u2018We stand here today because the president\u2019s continuing abuse of his power has left us no choice. To do nothing would make ourselves complicit in the president\u2019s abuse of his high office, the public trust and our national security.\u2019\n\nHouse Republican Minority Whip Steve Scalise had this to say: \u2018They\u2019re not impeaching the president because they can list an impeachable offense. They\u2019re impeaching him because they\u2019re afraid he will get re-elected.\u2019\n\nJoining Jim with news and analysis on this issue was Robert Romano. Robert is Vice President of Public Policy with Americans for Limited Government.\n\nThe two charges against the president are abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Democrats are accusing the president of leveraging foreign aid to Ukraine in exchange for alleged investigations into the president\u2019s political opponents, including former Vice President Joe Biden. The obstruction charge alleges that certain advisors to the president are not being allowed to testify before Congress under the guise of executive privilege.\n\n\n\nRobert believes that the hearings have shown that the president never demanded any investigation in exchange for handing over foreign aid. Instead, he was asking for investigations that had been ongoing long before Zelenski was even elected into the Burisma Holdings Company. In fact, there was even a question of money laundering to the United States that could have potentially violated U.S. laws that the Ukrainian prosecutors were attempting to pass along to our Justice Department.\n\n\n\nWe have a mutual legal assistance treaty with Ukraine. So, according to Robert, whether these actions/investigations would make President Trump look good or bad isn\u2019t relevant to the exercising of the treaty because looking into these issues is a legitimate undertaking by Ukraine and the Justice Department. So it would be well within the boundaries of the law to look at Burisma Holdings and any U.S. individuals, like Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who received money from Burisma. After all, the head of the company was Yanukovych\u2019s energy minister who was awarding natural gas exploration contracts to himself. So there\u2019s no \u2018quid pro quo\u2019 because these were ongoing investigations.\n\n\n\n\u2013Was our national security really threatened by the president\u2019s actions as has been alleged?\n\n\n\n\u2013What about the Inspector General\u2019s report concerning FISA abuses?\n\n\n\n\u2013Was Adam Schiff\u2019s opening statement from the impeachment inquiry fraudulent?\n\n\n\n\u2013Is this a \u2018witch hunt\u2019?\n\n\n\n\u2013Could the president be censured rather than impeached?\n\n\n\nThis is a complicated issue with many twists, turns and personalities.
