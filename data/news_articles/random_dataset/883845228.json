He added that as a result, many end up in conflict with the law.\n\nHolness said the aim is to give unattached youth hope, by augmenting the conventional training modalities under the merged entities.\n\n\u201cUntil we took the decision to merge the entities, many unattached youth were turned away from one agency and redirected to another, and in the process, many fell through the cracks.\n\n\u201cNow, every single person who knocks on HEART Trust/NTSA's door is given a road map for a productive life and meaningful future through training and development, whether through HOPE, which is helping our people excel, adult learning programmes, or other certification programmes,\u201d Holness stated.\n\nAmong other things, the Act is to streamline training processes; clearly establish the rights and obligations of trainees, employers and the HEART Trust/NTSA; and provide for transitional measures to facilitate the smooth transfer of administrative responsibilities to the trust."}}
