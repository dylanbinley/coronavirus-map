The charge was filed under seal in 2013 and announced by the Justice Department four years later.\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nThe extradition issue is likely to be raised this week when Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II speaks to several congressional committees to voice his opposition to Israel\u2019s plans to annex portions of the West Bank.\n\nMalki Roth\u2019s father Arnold on Tuesday said the new \u201creports of US officials challenging the Jordanians over their sheltering of Ahlam Tamimi are encouraging\u201d and \u201ca meaningful step forward.\u201d He told The Times of Israel: \u201cWe long for the day she faces justice in a US court.\u201d\n\nThe office of Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who approved the 2011 Shalit prisoner deal in which Tamimi was released from 16 life terms, declined to comment.\n\nRelated: Failed by Israel, Malki Roth\u2019s parents hope US can extradite her gloating killer\n\nTamimi is on the FBI\u2019s list of \u201cmost wanted terrorists\u201d for her role in escorting the suicide bomber from Ramallah to the crowded Jerusalem pizzeria where he struck. It was one of the deadliest terror attacks during the second Palestinian Intifada, or uprising. She has expressed no remorse and has been seen gloating that she managed to kill Israeli children.\n\nShe has lived freely in Jordan since Israel released her in the 2011 prisoner swap with terror group Hamas, when she and more than a thousand other security prisoners were released in exchange for captured IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. Jordanian authorities have rebuffed US requests to turn her over, despite an extradition treaty.\n\nThe US \u201cFurther Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020,\u201d which was signed into law on December 20, provides (section 7055) for financial consequences for Jordan if the case is not handled properly. Jordan has a large Palestinian population and it\u2019s unclear if a threat over aid would cause it to rethink its position.\n\nAhead of King Abdullah\u2019s video congressional appearances, scheduled for Wednesday with the US Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees, the State Department said that billions of dollars of foreign assistance to Jordan could be used as leverage to get Jordanian authorities to extradite Tamimi.\n\nThe threat came in written answers submitted by the administration\u2019s nominee for ambassador to Jordan, Henry Wooster, to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in response to questions posed by Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican.\n\n\u201cThe United States has multiple options and different types of leverage to secure Ahlam Aref Ahmad Al-Tamimi\u2019s extradition,\u201d Wooster wrote. \u201cWe will continue to engage Jordanian officials at all levels not only on this issue, but also on the extradition treaty more broadly. US generosity to Jordan in Foreign Military Financing as well as economic support and other assistance is carefully calibrated to protect and advance the range of US interests in Jordan and in the region.\u201d\n\nAsked specifically if aid to Jordan would be part of that leverage in the Tamimi case, Wooster replied: \u201cIf confirmed, I would explore all options to bring Ahlam Aref Ahmad Al-Tamimi to justice, secure her extradition, and address the broader issues associated with the extradition treaty.\u201d Wooster\u2019s responses to the questions were obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe reference to aid in Wooster\u2019s response was unusual. Previously, the Trump administration, and the Obama administration before it, had taken a low-key approach to Tamimi, bringing it up in private conversations with Jordanian officials but shying away from a public fight with a rare Arab country that recognizes Israel and has been a dependable source of intelligence information about the region, including in neighboring Syria.\n\nThe US has long been a major provider of aid to Jordan. In early 2018, the Trump administration signed a five-year, $6.4 billion aid agreement with Jordan that increased the annual amount of aid by $275 million to $1.3 billion. That boost \u201chighlights the pivotal role Jordan plays in helping foster and safeguard regional stability and supports US objectives such as the global campaign to defeat ISIS, counter-terrorism cooperation and economic development,\u201d the State Department said then.\n\nTamimi was arrested by Israel weeks after the bombing and sentenced to 16 life terms but released in the 2011 Israel-Hamas prisoner swap and moved to Jordan. She has made frequent media appearances, expressing no remorse for the attack and saying she was pleased with the high death toll.\n\nAmong the victims of the attack was Malki Roth, a 15-year-old Israeli-American girl, whose father, Arnold Roth, has led a campaign seeking Tamimi\u2019s extradition to the US.\n\n\u201cAs much as issues like justice get noisy public support, the odds tend to be stacked against people who want to see actual justice done in actual cases where they feel personally engaged,\u201d Roth told The Times of Israel Tuesday. \u201cAs parents of Malki, one of the child victims among the many innocents whose lives ended in the Sbarro pizzeria massacre, we encounter obstructiveness and double-talking officials far too often. I have no interest in hiding how embittering and frustrating this is.\n\n\u201cReports today of US officials challenging the Jordanians over their sheltering of Ahlam Tamimi are encouraging. No one can be sure this is going to lead to justice, least of all us. But it\u2019s a meaningful step forward in exposing and we hope ending a dark chapter.\u201d\n\nAdded Roth: \u201cAhlam Tamimi, who chose Sbarro as her target and brought the human bomb there because of the children she knew would be murdered, should never have been freed. And once freed and back in Jordan, she should never have been allowed to become an adored celebrity. And once she was famous, Jordan should have jumped at the opportunity to hand over to their most important ally, the US. We long for the day she faces justice in a US court.\u201d\n\nRoth told AP on Monday that his attempts to speak to Jordanian officials, including a letter sent to the ambassador in Washington last year, have been ignored. \u201cThe Jordanians have been egregiously rude and unhelpful in every possible way which we\u2019ve tried to engage with them,\u201d he said.\n\nRoth said he has begun to make progress with members of the US Congress, citing an April 30 letter signed by seven Republican lawmakers to Jordan\u2019s ambassador seeking Tamimi\u2019s extradition.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I have been battling since February 2012 to see the United States charge, extradite and prosecute this horrifying fugitive from justice who proudly boasts of murdering so many children,\u201d he said.\n\nThe blast at the Sbarro restaurant in downtown Jerusalem went off on the afternoon of August 9, 2001. The terrorist detonated explosives hidden in a guitar case packed with nails. Among the people killed were seven between the ages of 2 and 16, and scores were wounded.\n\nTamimi, a Hamas activist who chose the target and guided the bomber there, said in a 2017 interview with the AP that Palestinians have a right to resist Israeli rule by any means, including deliberately targeting uninvolved civilians and children.\n\nIn 2017, Jordan\u2019s high court ruled she could not be extradited to the US, reportedly saying the 1995 extradition treaty had not been ratified. She has also claimed the US has no right to charge her because she was already tried and sentenced in Israel.\n\nThe US insisted in a report last year that the extradition treaty is valid in the case of Tamimi.\n\nArnold Roth told The Times of Israel last month \u201cThere is wall-to-wall agreement among the legal experts at the Department of Justice that there is no \u2018double jeopardy\u2019 concern.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cShe was convicted of acts of murder on her own confession. She has now been indicted with different charges and in a different jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nThe charge filed by the Department of Justice against Tamimi is one of \u201cconspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction against US nationals outside the US, resulting in death.\u201d"}}
