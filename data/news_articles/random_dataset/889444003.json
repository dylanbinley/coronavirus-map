They were born eight weeks early. Tollifer\u2019s adjusting to life in the NICU at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital and was surprised to learn she has a lot of company there.\n\n\u201cI had no idea that having twins right now was such the in thing,\u201d she said.\n\nIt certainly appears to be. Twelve sets of twins are in the NICU at St. Luke\u2019s, a record for the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe always see multiples in here, but not twelve sacks at one time,\u201d said Danielle Gathers, NICU nurse.\n\nThe hospital said staffing has been a challenge. All the twins were born between five and 14 weeks early. Some will be in the hospital much longer than others, and it can be stressful for families.\n\n\u201cI like that they have each other to kind of bounce off of. We don\u2019t always have multiple sets of multiple. So these moms have each other,\u201d Gathers said.\n\nThe history-making babies will spend Thanksgiving at St. Luke\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that they\u2019ll be home by Christmas. Our ultimate goal,\u201d Tollifer said."}}
