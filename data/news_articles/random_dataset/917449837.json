The allegations of an attack seem to be meant to bolster the case for a US preemptive strike.\n\n\n\nThe occasional stray rocket fire against US interests in Iraq are being blamed uniformly by officials on these militias, and the reality is that even if Iran doesn\u2019t do anything itself, the simple actions of Iraqi factions will be enough for the US to keep talking about a \u201cthreat\u201d posed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: Jason Ditz Jason Ditz is news editor of Antiwar.com.
