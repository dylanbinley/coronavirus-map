The exhibit featuring veterans and their tattoos and the stories behind the ink is planned for November at the Northport-East Northport Public Library.\n\nHeaviside, Northport-East Northport's Community Services librarian and the project\u2019s director, said the idea was borne of a similar exhibit in Seattle she saw in a webinar. The exhibit is perfect for the library, she said, marrying the proximity of the nearby Northport VA Medical Center and the community\u2019s love of art. She said it was a fitting way to honor the community\u2019s military service members.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so close to the veterans center, and we have a huge gallery space in both of our buildings,\u201d Heaviside said. \u201cWe\u2019re actually known as the 'art library' of Long Island, so we have a real interest and our community is huge with art.\u201d\n\nSince spring, veterans have come to the library's Laurel Avenue branch each month to have photos taken of them and their tattoos and to tell the stories behind their body art. As of the August shoot, no female veterans had responded to the library\u2019s invitation to be photographed for the exhibit.\n\nThe veterans' photos and stories will be displayed on 24-by-36-inch posters mounted on boards in the gallery at either of the library district\u2019s two buildings for November, designated Veterans and Military Families Month by the U.S. Department of Defense. (See box for exhibit information.)\n\nFor Heaviside the project is also a tribute to her father, George L. Cressy, an Army lieutenant and Vietnam veteran who served as platoon commander with Company C, 3rd Battalion, 8th Infantry, 4th Infantry Division, earning a Bronze Star and Purple Heart.\n\nShe said growing up she would ask him about his tattoos. \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got a story for this one,\u2019 \u201d Heaviside said.\n\nSign up for The Classroom newsletter. Education on Long Island is changing. Find out how. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\n\n\u201cI said everyone must have a story behind their tattoo whether it\u2019s good or bad,\" she said. \"So, I said it would be a really cool way for the guys to open up and talk.\u201d\n\nAnd they have. At least 21 veterans have shared their tattoos and themselves, a sometimes emotional experience for them \u2014 and Heaviside.\n\nIt\u2019s also been bittersweet. One of the first veterans photographed, Northport resident Guilford P. Harris, who was a Navy cook/baker 3rd class petty officer who served for six years, died just short of his 80 birthday about a week after he was photographed.\n\n\u201cHe was so proud of being a veteran,\u201d Heaviside said. \u201cWe got his last photographs, and it was really emotional.\u201d\n\nChris Cordone, owner of Huntington-based Foxlight Studios and the photographer behind the images for the library, said it has been an enriching experience to connect people to historical events in an unexpected way.\n\n\u201cYou get to hear little bits and pieces you don\u2019t usually get to hear or read about in history books \u2014 more behind the scenes stuff,\u201d Cardone said. \u201cSome of them came in and opened up and told us more than they told family members.\u201d\n\nOnce the province of bikers and military personnel \u2014 and the object of scorn and a source of ostracism \u2014 tattoos have become commonplace. Heaviside said she hopes this project will lead the way in changing the remaining stigma surrounding tattoos.\n\n\"I want people to look at veterans differently and see them, as they are stories themselves,\" she said. \"And as a librarian, that\u2019s like the perfect tie in: We love to hear the story, it\u2019s the story behind the art.\u201d\n\nVeterans with military tattoos who would like to participate can be photographed at the library's final session on Oct. 3 (see box). Here we share the stories from a few veterans who will be featured in the exhibit.\n\nBill Chapman, Army 1968\n\nArmy veteran Bill Chapman, 72, said he enlisted after attending Farmingdale College for a year.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something for my country,\u201d said Chapman, who lives in Ronkonkoma. \u201cWhat you saw on the news\" inspired him to enlist, he said.\n\nHe said he served for a year as an infantryman in Cu Chi, in Ho Chi Minh City, then returned home.\n\n\u201cI was in Vietnam in 1968, the turning point, the Tet Offensive, everything changed after that,\u201d Chapman said softly. \u201cI was really fortunate I came home unscathed, some hearing loss, but that\u2019s nothing compared to some of the guys.\u201d\n\nDuring a spring visit to the Northport VA Medical Center, Chapman saw the flyer for \"Ink Stories.\"\n\n\u201cI knew I wanted to be a part of it, he said. \u201cAnything to get the word out, our stories.\u201d\n\nHis tattoos of a Fallen Soldiers Cross, a rifle set on boots with a helmet on top meant to signify a dead serviceman, and of his Vietnam campaign ribbons were inked about 10 years ago.\n\nChapman, an F-14 production worker for years at Grumman and now an HVAC technician, isn\u2019t sure why it took him so long to get service-related tattoos, but one day something clicked.\n\n\u201cI saw one one day, somebody had one and the light went off, I decided I wanted one,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of my service, to be a part of this, something so big.\u201d\n\nGeorge W. Harstedt III, Army 1966-1968\n\nVietnam veteran George W. Harstedt III, 74, of Northport was reluctant to tell his story. But after some prompting from his wife, Susan Tickering, he agreed.\n\nHarstedt is a bit of a rebel \u2014 albeit a respectful one. His father, a World War II Marine, never got a tattoo and forbade his son to get one, at least while his father was alive. Harstedt, who served in the Army from 1966 to 1968 in the south of Vietnam, waited as long as he could \u2014 until 2003 \u2014 a year short of his father\u2019s death.\n\nHarstedt has two tattoos, one on each arm, both military.\n\nOne tattoo, that of a combat infantryman badge given to those in combat, is in tribute to his service as a sergeant in the 1st Infantry Division, nicknamed \"Big Red One.\" His second is an Air Medal for helicopter assaults in combat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of what I had done. I don\u2019t know why my dad didn\u2019t get one, but he was Amherst, Harvard graduate, and they don\u2019t get tattoos.\u201d\n\nThe younger Harstedt was involved in at least 60 combat missions.\n\n\u201cI saw a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cCombat assaults means they fly us in. You didn\u2019t necessarily have to see combat, but you were flown into a combat zone.\u201d After the service he worked as a union dock builder, clam digger and union operating engineer.\n\nGeorge Poulos, Marines 2013-2017\n\nMarine infantryman George Poulos, 25, of Islip Terrace has at least nine military tattoos, most of which reflect his years of service from 2013 to 2017.\n\n\u201cI picked the Marines over the other branches because I was promised a challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter boot camp at Parris Island, South Carolina, Poulos served in such places as the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Jordan, Oman and Bahrain.\n\nHe got his first tattoo \u2014 a cross on the side of his rib cage that features dog tags emblazoned with \u201cMom\" and \"Dad\u201d \u2014 right after boot camp. It's the tattoo dearest to him.\n\nBut the one that gets the most reaction is a full-back tattoo, which people have told him is \u201cterrifying.\u201d That tattoo features images including a ram skull, women with wings, spent ammunition and a squad. He said some of the imagery was inspired by his squad\u2019s nickname, \"Black Sheep.\" He explained that his unit provided support and security to units closer to the front line, and got its nickname in the spirit of sibling rivalry.\n\nHe said the idea for the tattoo was envisioned while he and his squad were returning from a deployment.\n\nHis last two military tattoos were in honor of friends who died.\n\nThe full-time criminal justice student said when people see his tattoos they should not be turned off or frightened. \"The idea is I just cared about the guys I served with,\" he said.\n\nUzy Qamar, Marines 2004-2008\n\nMarine veteran Uzy Qamar, 34, of East Northport, knew he wanted a tattoo. But it had to be say something about him as a Marine \u2014 and as an individual.\n\nHe decided on an interpretation of the Marine motto, Semper Fidelis, that better fit him and his heritage: the phrase, which means \"always faithful,\" inked on his back in Arabic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a faithful, trustworthy person,\u201d Qamar said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been true, even if my heart doesn\u2019t go with it, but I know it\u2019s the right thing to do, I follow the code.\u201d\n\nHe said he wrestled with a how tattoo could best represent his feelings. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t, for some reason, do the 'Semper Fidelis' one, I\u2019m not of Latin descent and I just couldn\u2019t picture it. If I wasn\u2019t going to do it in English, I was then bent on doing it in Arabic.\u201d\n\nOnce he made up his mind, he recruited his mother to do the translation.\n\n\u201cA couple of the privates were like, \u2018we\u2019re getting tattoos.\u2019 I felt it was a brother bonding experience,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we all went together.\u201d\n\nHe joined the Marines in 2004 and went to boot camp at Parris Island, followed by Marine Corps training in North Carolina and later serving as a law clerk. He currently works as an events coordinator and website social media manager at a law firm.\n\n\u201c 'Always faithful,' the phrase is who I am,\u201d he said.\n\nAndres Garcia, Marines 2002-2006\n\nMarine veteran Andres Garcia, 36, of Cambria Heights, Queens, said just as being a Marine is part of his identity, so especially is his tattoo.\n\nHe joined the Marines in 2001 but was unable to leave for basic training until he graduated from Flushing's John Bowne High School in 2002. He joined because he didn\u2019t have money for college, he said, but knew from a tough upbringing that he wanted more out of life: the success the Marines offered.\n\n\u201cI found a way out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Marine Corps always stuck out to me even when I was a kid. \u2026 They had everything I wanted: honor, belonging, pride.\u201d\n\nHis military tattoo features a skull gripping a bloody knife in its teeth and wearing a Marine Corps hat, with an eagle, globe and anchor (the Marine Corps logo) sketched in the middle.\n\n\u201cThe skull represents me, that regardless of what happens to me in life \u2014 even after life, as [when] I\u2019m gone from this world, I\u2019ll always be a Marine,\u201d he said. \u201cThe knife [in the tattoo] was just really cool when I got it. I was 18.\u201d\n\nGarcia said it took two visits to get the tattoo, which was inked by an elderly Japanese man in Okinawa, and he still feels sentimental when he looks at it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that I served my country, that I did something special,\u201d said Garcia, now an analyst for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nFrank Perry, Marines 1984-1988\n\nFrank Perry, 52, of Wantagh, who served in the Marines from 1984 to 1988, has two military tattoos. He got his first after boot camp in 1985 at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, choosing the Marine Corps bulldog.\n\n\u201cThe choice of tattoos was usually the Marine logo, which is the eagle, globe and anchor, or the bulldog; and I thought the bulldog showed the attitude and traits of what I learned in boot camp of what a Marine is,\u201d said Perry, who now works as a senior account manager for a biotech firm.\n\nWhile in the service, his assignments included working with the officers\u2019 mess at The Basic School at Quantico, Virginia, arranging special events for visiting dignitaries, officer mess nights, mixers and commanding generals\u2019 nights.\n\n\u201cIt was a great experience and really taught me how to act and behave and conduct myself around those with elevated rank,\u201d he said. \u201cMy occasional workout partner in the gym was the commanding officer of the base.\u201d\n\nThat understanding of reverence and respect is behind his second military tattoo, a POW-MIA logo that honors veterans who never made it home. There is one person in particular, Perry said, that tattoo pays homage to: his uncle Alfred Patrick Perry, of Howard Beach, a Korean War veteran. The elder Perry was taken prisoner Nov. 30, 1950, and marched 20 miles to a Chinese prison camp, where he died from exposure on Feb. 11, 1951. He was 20.\n\n\u201cI get a lot of compliments on this one, it\u2019s so unique,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI get stopped on the street all time.\u201d\n\nHe noted that he got the tattoo on the third Friday of September, a day he later learned is traditionally National POW-MIA Recognition Day. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it at the time, but that\u2019s the day I got it in 2015,\u201d Perry said. \u201cTruth, I didn\u2019t know it.\"\n\nMichael DePaoli, Navy 1967-1968 and Army 1972-1974\n\nMichael DePaoli, 72, of South Setauket, did two tours in Vietnam and served in both the Navy and Army. While in the Navy in 1967 and 1968 he served as a second-class petty officer.\n\n\u201cI was very fortunate to be in the Navy at the time. We guarded the aircraft carriers; I was on a destroyer, which intercepted the torpedoes,\u201d he said.\n\nHe served in the Army from 1972 to 1974 as a helicopter crew chief. After his service, he went to college on the GI Bill, getting two associate's degrees, a bachelor's degree and two master's degrees.\n\nDePaoli said military service changed him in many ways. \"Being in the military made me grow up fast and have more respect for life and other people,\" he said.\n\nHe keeps a positive disposition, even handing out yellow smiley-face buttons everywhere he goes; that's his way of paying it forward, he said. \"I get so much joy out of giving out such a small item that makes people smile.\"\n\nHe has about 10 military tattoos. One of his more recent tattoos is a Fallen Soldiers Cross inked on his right leg about four months ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an homage to all of the soldiers we\u2019ve lost, especially recently. It\u2019s the ultimate sacrifice,\" DePaoli said."}}
