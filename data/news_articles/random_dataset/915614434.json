On Mar. 25, the airline \u2013 which boasts a fleet of 271 aircraft, including Airbus A380s and Boeing 777s -- suspended all passenger flights for at least two weeks.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates, or UAE, where Dubai is located, has also closed its borders to travelers. Only some cargo flights and a few airplanes repatriating Emirati citizens are using the country's airports.\n\nDubai\u2019s Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum said the liquidity is necessary for the airline \u201cconsidering its strategic importance\u201d to Dubai and the economy of the UAE.\n\nThe crown price did not specify the amount of cash that will be provided.\n\n\u201cToday, we renew our commitment to support a success story that started in the mid-1980s to reach its goal of sitting on the throne of global aviation. The government of Dubai is committed to fully supporting Emirates at this critical time and will inject equity into the company,\u201d the Dubai crown prince said on Twitter. \u201cEmirates, our national carrier, positioned Dubai as [a] global travel hub and has great strategic value as one of the main pillars of Dubai's economy, as well as the wider economy of the UAE. We will announce further details about the equity injection and more measures soon.\u201d\n\nEmirates has already cut salaries for its 100,000-member staff for three months, with reductions ranging from 25%-50% -- in order to avoid layoffs.\n\n\u201cOur business is taking a hit, but what matters in the long run is that we do the right thing for our customers, our employees, and the communities we serve,\u201d said Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum.\n\nEmirates carried about 90 million passengers last year and is one of the few Arab-owned airlines to have generated profits in recent years.\n\nFor the half-year period ended Sept. 30, 2019 the airline generated net profit of $320 million.\n\nThe carrier's base of operations, Dubai International Airport, has been the world\u2019s busiest international travel hub for six consecutive years, supplanting London\u2019s Heathrow.\n\nAnother state-owned airline, the low-cost flydubai said on Tuesday it will cut salaries of its 4,000-strong workforce by between 25% to 50% for a three-month period beginning in April. Employees' benefits will remain in place, while senior employees will endure the largest pay cuts.\n\n\u201cThis decision has not been taken lightly,\u201d the company said, but with a \u201cheavy heart\" and \u201cwith the aim of retaining our employees and ensuring we are in the best possible place when our regular schedule resumes.\u201d\n\nEmirates and flydubai are both owned by Dubai\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and share the same chairman, but operate independently of each other.\n\nLast week, the International Air Transport Association estimated revenues of Middle East airlines will plunge by $19 billion, or 39%, in 2020 over the prior year.\n\n\"The airline industry faces its gravest crisis ... For airlines, it's apocalypse now,\" IATA chief Alexandre de Juniac said.\n\nThe Arab Air Carriers' Association, or AACO, has urged regional governments to help their airlines.\n\nAACO specifically recommended that governments provide tax relief to airlines for at least a period of two years; and provide \u201cspeedy\u201d financial support packages for airlines in order \u201cto shield more than 150,000 families whose livelihood rely on airlines.\n\nThe UAE, which comprises seven emirates including Dubai, has reported 611 coronavirus cases and five deaths."}}
