But Carlson acted as though it was Sen. Ben Sasse who ordered the strike, not Donald Trump.\n\nI don\u2019t want to impose a purity test on a potentially important ally opposing Trump\u2019s reckless escalation against Iran. But Carlson clearly bent over backwards to blame just about everyone but the guy responsible.\n\nCarlson called the strike \u201ca pivot point,\u201d presumably of escalation. As evidence, he sneeringly read a tweet by nemesis John Bolton. offering \u201cCongratulations to all involved\u201d and saying, \u201cHope this is the first step toward regime change in Tehran.\u201d\n\nWe also saw a clip of Trump woodenly declaring that he didn\u2019t take action to start a war or to effect regime change. Carlson provided no pushback or challenge.\n\nBecause everything Liar-in-Chief Trump says is true on Fox, apparently.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, though \u2013 not so much.\n\nCARLSON: According to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, meanwhile, Soleimani was killed to forestall planned attacks on Americans. But as he later conceded, those attacks would have occurred in the Middle East, not here in America.\n\nWe saw a clip of Pompeo saying as much, with a banner and a graphic on the screen underscoring the point.\n\nCarlson added, \u201cBy the way, if we\u2019re still in Afghanistan 19 years \u2013 sad \u2013 later, what makes us think there\u2019s a quick way out of Iran?\u201d\n\nThen Carlson went on a lengthy harangue against Sasse. I\u2019m certainly not a fan of him or his support for the strike but he\u2019s not the commander in chief.\n\nCARLSON: Chest beaters like Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska are making the usual warlike noises, the ones they always make. \u201cThis is very simple,\u201d Ben Sasse wrote in a statement last night. \u201cGeneral Soleimani is dead because he was an evil bastard who murdered Americans.\u201d Which is essentially true. Soleimani was certainly a bad guy. But does that make killing him, quote very simple? It does not.\n\nNothing about life and certainly nothing about killing is ever \u201cvery simple,\u201d and any politician who tells you otherwise is dumb or is lying. Yes, Soleimani was linked to the death of Americans. Nobody mourns his passing. But Mexico and China are also linked to the deaths of Americans. Each has flooded our country with narcotics from which tens of thousands of Americans die every single year, not that anyone in power cares. So does that mean we get to bomb Oaxaca? Can we start assassinating generals in the People\u2019s Liberation Army? Maybe. Maybe Ben Sasse will call for that too. He\u2019s a former consultant and a very tough character [said with sarcasm].\n\nBut before we enter into a single new war, there\u2019s a criterion that ought to be met. Our leaders should explain to us how that conflict will make the United States richer and more secure. There are an awful lot of bad people in this world. We can\u2019t kill them all. It\u2019s not our job.\n\nInstead, our government exists to defend and promote the interests of American citizens, period. That\u2019s why we have a government. So has the killing of Soleimani done that? Maybe. No one in Washington has explained how. Instead, like Ben Sasse, they\u2019re telling us what an awful person he was. He clearly was. So? That\u2019s irrelevant.\n\nBut once Carlson got through making sure not to blame Trump for a horrific blunder of his own making, Carlson began to make a lot of sense. The lower third banners didn\u2019t mince words, either. I\u2019m including some of them below:\n\nCARLSON: Meanwhile, it\u2019s pretty clear that things can start to move in the wrong direction pretty quickly. We\u2019re praying they don\u2019t but they could. How do we know that? \u2018Cause we\u2019ve seen it before. We fought quite a number of wars around the Middle East in recent decades. We attacked Saddam Hussein twice, as you know. In the end, we killed him. We invaded and occupied Afghanistan. We toppled Muammar Qaddafi in Libya. We fought ISIS in Syria and for some reason stuck around. We\u2019re still there. We joined humanitarian missions in Lebanon and Somalia. Our special forces have been quietly fighting in Yemen, Pakistan, Niger. Who knows where else? Many other places.\n\nIn every single place, each of these conflicts turned out to be longer and bloodier and more expensive than we were promised in the first place. The benefits? Often, they\u2019ve been non-existent.\n\nA lot of lectures about how the people we\u2019re killing deserve to die. Certainly, they did. Hope that makes you feel better.\n\nWhat do the American people think about all of this? Not that anyone cares. Well, it\u2019s too soon, strictly speaking, to know. The killing of Soleimani happened just last night.\n\nBut just five months ago, after months of supposed Iranian provocation, Americans didn\u2019t seem to view Iran as a major concern, not even close. In a Gallup poll, taken last August, just 18% of Americans said that they backed military force to shut down Iran\u2019s nuclear program. 78% said they preferred diplomacy and economic sanctions alone.\n\nSo, in a democracy, you\u2019d think this would matter. But as is so often the case, the preferences of actual Americans don\u2019t enter the equation at all. They\u2019re immaterial.\n\nFinally, near the end, Carlson provided milquetoast-y kinda/sorta criticism of Trump \u2013 but that quickly deflected to blaming \u201cWashington.\u201d\n\nCARLSON: In 2016, Donald Trump ran on a promise of fewer foreign adventures, considering the ones we embarked upon didn\u2019t work very well. He vowed instead to focus on our problems here at home which are growing. Against the odds, he won that election, probably because of that promise.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut ever since, Washington, including some around the president, have been committed to ignoring the results of that election and its implications. Washington has wanted war with Iran for decades. They\u2019ve been working toward it.\n\nThey may have finally gotten it.\n\nNot mentioned by Carlson, despite his claim to be the \u201csworn enemy\u201d of \u201cgroup think\u201d: Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement his own intelligence community said was working and he has decimated the State Dept. What did Carlson think was going to happen as a result?\n\nNevertheless, Carlson has bucked the war mongering and Fox's cheerleading of Dear Leader\u2019s every move. And that is nothing to sneeze at.\n\nWatch it below, from the January 3, 2020 Tucker Carlson Tonight."}}
