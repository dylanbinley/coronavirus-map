Just like a family that has outgrown its current or starter home, your company now needs a new hosting company to call home.\n\nWeb hosting providers in this digital age should not be anything short of great load times, 99.9% uptime, and great pricing. You need to make sure you follow the latest hosting news to remain on top of the current market trends and offerings available.\n\nIt might be that you went for the cheapest hosting solution that was available, but it turned out to obey the saying, \"you get what you pay for\"\u2014or the host is reluctant to institute and put in place the changing current market demand trends.\n\nMost web hosting providers that are worth their advertising will help you grow easily. There are companies like Hostinger.com that can help new users scale seamlessly, along with others. It\u2019s essential to do your research and better understand what helps or gets in the way of you improving your website.\n\nTo save you time during these moments, here are the most common reasons why you need a new business web hosting. More importantly, business managers and owners should always keep an eye out for these signs and consider switching to a new business website hosting solution ASAP.\n\n\n\n\n\nWebsite Loading at a Snail's Pace\n\nEven a child knows that a slow website is a revenue killer. Think of all the potential customers or visitors who could have converted but bounced back owing to the slow speed. Besides, Google hates slow websites and places such sites very low in their SERP.\n\nOften, slow websites are a result of too many users or too many requests on the server.\n\nIn any case, your web hosting provider should be in a position to help you figure out why your site is running slow.\n\nIf the crawling is caused by too many requests, then you can fix it with some tweaking, whether it's further optimizing the server or removing some plugins. But if the issue emanates from having a weak web hosting service, then the host will advise you to upgrade your plan.\n\nYou will find that most of the businesses often commence their online presence with the low cost shared hosting plans to save their initial costs.\n\nAs the traffic levels increases, these shared hostings begin to slow down the website as a result of the uneven allocation of resources. In such cases, you should consider upgrading your hosting solution.\n\nYou can use tools like the Google PageSpeed test to figure out what\u2019s at fault when your website begins to slow down. It will provide valuable insights that will explain if it is your website\u2019s optimization or your web hosting provider\u2019s or plan\u2019s issue.\n\nFrequent Unexpected Downtimes\n\nDowntimes directly translates into revenue loss. They are not only bad for your overall reputation but also no visitor wants to visit a site that can't open half of the time. If you notice that your website is down multiple times, then it is crystal clear that you need to switch your hosting providers.\n\nWhat are the indicators that your site is down? As you are not visiting your site throughout, it's very hard to know without using a monitoring service. Thanks to the Pingdom website monitoring service, you can now monitor your uptime for free.\n\nUptime indicates the time your server system has been online. On the other hand, downtime indicates when your server is out of reach. So, if you see 99% uptime, it shows that your site experienced some minor outages in the course of the month.\n\nIf your current hosting provider is not in a position to explain the cause of downtime that occurred, or they are giving unconvincing reasons, it's time to move.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoor Customer Support Service\n\nWebsites and hosting are sometimes complex and some errors can arise at any time. Since most of the website owners or managers are not technically proficient to solve these arising issues, hosting support is key for continuing businesses. If your hosting provider is not answering your calls or replying to your emails, then it is time to leave.\n\nIt is true that you cannot keep everyone happy but never compromise with the customer quality of your hosting provider as slow or no response to your hosting related problems shows that the provider is not competent enough to handle your website hosting.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Feel that Your Website is Vulnerable\n\nA reliable web hosting service should be coupled with trustworthy security measures to deter any cyber-attack attempts. Many hosting providers have in place firewalls and DDoS protection but this is not enough in the current fast-paced cyber world.\n\nMake sure that your business website service provider offers an SSL certificate along with two-factor authentication as the bear minimum.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Web Hosting Provider Can't keep the Pace of Your Business Growth\n\nCurrently, businesses can choose from four types of web hosting solutions \u2013 shared, VPS, Dedicated, and Cloud. Most of the web hosts provide only the first three to their clients. But these three are sometimes not suitable for growing businesses because of some technical challenges or cost issues.\n\nThe cloud-based hosting solution, on the other hand, is more flexible in terms of the available resources as well as the operational capabilities. This is the ideal web host service that offers the best fusion between functionality and cost for your business.\n\n\n\n\n\nWrapping up\n\nHosting is an indispensable part of the success of your digital business. If you feel that your current hosting provider is not keeping up with the demand of your business, it's recommended that you move to a better hosting solution."}}
