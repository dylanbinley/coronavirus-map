Each of them offered GHS100 to the officers to be allowed to continue their journey. This, the officers rejected,\u201d the release disclosed.\n\n\u201cThe officers asked that they are sent back. The driver of the vehicle was very cooperative with the officers. Due to the fact that some Ghanaian nationals who were also onboard the vehicle could be inconvenienced, a call was placed to the manager on the OA Transport company, named Kingsley, who arranged for another vehicle from Tamale to convey them back to the Paga Border post to be repatriated.\u201d\n\nGhana has closed its land, sea, and air borders and is not allowing the movement of public buses except it is transporting goods and cargo.\n\nThe move is part of efforts to stop the spread of Coronavirus in the country, yet some foreigners continue to illegally find their way into Ghana.\n\nSince the border closure, about 40 Burkinabe nationals have been arrested in the Northern part of the country using unapproved routes to enter the country.\n\n---citinewsroom"}}
