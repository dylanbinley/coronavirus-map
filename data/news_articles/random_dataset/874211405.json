Many of the displaced persons across the nation are also victims of these conflicts.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we are saddened that the rapporteur did not address intra-ethnic conflicts and cattle rustling as key elements in herders/farmers conflicts,\u201d the Presidency said in a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Mr Garba Shehu.\n\nThe rapporteur, Agnes Callamard, in one report this month, said \u201cNigeria is a Pressure Cooker of Conflict\u201d, warning that it posed dangers to the rest of West Africa.\n\nAside from widespread killings by Boko Haram, she touched on raging banditry, killings by herdsmen over right of access to farmlands, kidnapping and alleged increasing human rights abuses by Nigerian security forces, all which the rapporteur noted, had not been really addressed.\n\n\u201cThe lack of accountability is on such a scale that pretending this is nothing short of a crisis will be a major mistake. If ignored, its ripple effect will spread in the sub-region given the country\u2019s important role in the continent,\u201d she had stated.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.
