The hospitalized man had no symptoms when he arrived at the Seattle-Tacoma airport last week, but he started feeling ill. He had traveled to China in November, flying home to Washington state Jan. 15 before the start of U.S. airport screening.\n\nInvestigators will make daily phone calls to those 16 who had contact with him, including some who sat near him on his flight, to check if they have symptoms. They will not be asked to isolate themselves unless they start feeling ill.\n\n\u201cThis may be a novel virus, but this is not a novel investigation,\u201d said John Wiesman of the Washington State Department of Health at a Wednesday briefing for reporters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe patient is doing well in an isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, about 30 miles north of Seattle.\n\nThe virus can cause coughing, fever, breathing difficulty and pneumonia"}}
