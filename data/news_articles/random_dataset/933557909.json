But when plays are filmed and put into theatrical or streaming release, suddenly they have to follow the same content rules as films, or risk MPA censure. That\u2019s exactly what happened to the Broadway musical Hamilton, as a recording of the stage production was readied for Disney Plus.\n\nHamilton was caught between a particular rock and a hard place: The MPA confers an automatic R rating upon any movie that has more than one spoken \u201cfuck\u201d in it. And to maintain a family-friendly face, the Disney Plus streaming service doesn\u2019t include content with ratings past the PG-13 line.\n\nHamilton has not one, not two, but three \u201cfuck\u201ds in it. And so, as the show\u2019s creator Lin-Manuel Miranda put it on Twitter, \u201cI literally gave two fucks so the kids could see it.\u201d\n\nTwo fucks were edited out of Hamilton in order to make it clean enough for Disney Plus. But which two? And were they the right ones?\n\nWhat are the \u2018fuck\u2019s in Hamilton?\n\nThe first fuck in Hamilton comes close to the close of the first act, as the cast joins in a dramatization of the Siege of Yorktown (\u201cYorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)\u201d). A few verses give a brief update on the location and activities of Alexander Hamilton\u2019s friends in the Continental Army, culminating in a verse from Okieriete Onaodowan\u2019s Hercules Mulligan, tailor and revolutionary spy.\n\n\u201cHercules Mulligan,\u201d Onaodowan sings, \u201cI need no introduction, when you knock me down I get the fuck back up again.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a straightforward use of the swear word for emphasis, emblematic of the modern slang of Mulligan\u2019s adopted city of New York.\n\nThe second fuck occurs in the number \u201cSay No to This,\u201d which dramatizes Hamilton\u2019s extramarital affair with Maria Reynolds. Her husband, James Reynolds, writes to Hamilton:\n\nDear sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health / and in a prosperous enough position to put wealth / in the pockets of people like me down on their luck. / You see, that was my wife you decided to \u2014\n\nAt this point, the chorus member playing James Reynolds pauses so Miranda\u2019s Hamilton can gasp, \u201cFuuuuuuuuu\u2026\u201d in horrified realization. It\u2019s a complicated use of the word, both as an exclamation of surprise and dread, and a humorous pun on its basic meaning as a verb, \u201cto have sexual intercourse with.\u201d But on the other hand, Hamilton trails off without actually completing the syllable, softening its impact. It\u2019s really only half a fuck.\n\nThe final fuck in Hamilton happens in the number \u201cWashington on Your Side,\u201d in which Onaodowan\u2019s James Madison and Daveed Diggs\u2019 Thomas Jefferson, founders of the Democratic-Republican Party, discuss their frustrations with Hamilton\u2019s work as a fellow member of George Washington\u2019s cabinet. Hamilton (a Federalist) is opposed to many of their decisions, so Jefferson resolves to investigate his finances to find a way of discrediting him, and force him to resign.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s show these Federalists what they\u2019re up against,\u201d they sing, \u201cSouthern motherfucking Democratic-Republicans!\u201d\n\nThis is definitely the most emphatic fuck in Hamilton, modified with both the \u201cing\u201d suffix and the \u201cmother\u201d prefix. It\u2019s also the most metrically interesting, coming after three lines that seem to lead to a rhythmic payoff. \u201cThis immigrant isn\u2019t somebody we chose!\u201d is followed by \u201cThis immigrant\u2019s keeping us all on our toes!\u201d Then \u201cLet\u2019s show these Federalists what they\u2019re up against,\u201d sets up for another line with the same rhythm, as the chose/toes lines mirror each other. Instead, Miranda crams a \u201cmotherfucking\u201d in the middle of the otherwise staid phrase \u201cSouthern Democratic-Republicans.\u201d\n\nHamilton\u2019s final fuck is its most musically interesting and, lyrically, metrically, and linguistically, its most emphatic. So naturally, it has been censored for the PG-13 version of the show.\n\nYou\u2019ll only hear half a fuck in Hamilton on Disney Plus\n\nMiranda shared the news on Twitter a couple weeks before the stage recording\u2019s debut:\n\n...I literally gave two fucks so the kids could see it:\n\n1. In Yorktown, there's a mute over \"I get the f___ back up again\"\n\n2. \"Southern *record scratch*kin' Democratic Republicans.\"\n\nYou can sing whatEVER you like at home (even sync up the album)!\n\nLove you. Enjoy. \u2014 Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) June 22, 2020\n\nThe fuck that was allowed to remain in Hamilton on Disney Plus is the incomplete and least emphatic one, which probably made it a shoo-in for the MPA\u2019s One Fuck rule.\n\nIronically, it\u2019s also the only fuck in Hamilton that is actually a reference to mature themes rather than a mere exclamation. But that\u2019s the MPA for you."}}
