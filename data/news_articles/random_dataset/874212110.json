I would threaten to kill her if she shouts. So out of fear, she would not shout and I would tell her that I would not kill her if she cooperates.\n\n\u201cI would tear the pillowcase and tie their hands and legs and strangle them. While this was going on, some of them would tell me that they had money in their accounts.\n\nREAD ALSO: Edo driver kills baby, mother-in-law, wife\u2019s sister\n\n\u201cAfter confirming how much they had in their accounts, I would collect the pin numbers and at daybreak when I must have killed them, I would go to ATM and collect the money in the account,\u201d West recounted.\n\nHe explained that he used the money he got from the deceased\u2019s bank account to prepare for further lethal operations in hotels in Lagos, Imo and Owerri, adding that his first victim, who he killed in Lagos, had N52,000 in her account.\n\n\u201cI have killed five girls in Port Harcourt, one in Owerri and one in Lagos. I started the killing in Lagos; that was where I got N52,000. After that, I went to Port Harcourt, then to Owerri. I returned to Port Harcourt and the last woman I met was at a club,\u201d he added.\n\nThe suspect stated that he always collected the mobile phones of her suspects and sold them at the Waterlines area in Port Harcourt, so that the police would not be able to get in touch with the victims\u2019 relatives.\n\nSurprisingly, West, from Asari-Toru, attributed his action to an unknown force, adding that whenever the urge to kill came, he would not stop until he murdered a young woman in a hotel.\n\nHe said, \u201cAfter realising my sins, I sought spiritual intervention in a church. I told the pastor that I have been killing girls in hotels and the pastor said that they had a crusade programme and invited me to see the senior pastor but I waited and couldn\u2019t see him.\n\n\u201cSo, I left the church and went back and checked into a hotel. Seriously, I don\u2019t know what makes me to kill; whenever it comes on me, that is when I kill, later I regret and feel sober but after a while, I would go and kill again.\u201d\n\nHowever, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr Mustapha Dandaura, said the arrest of West became possible with the assistance of one of the hotels that complied with the directive on the installation of closed circuit television.\n\nThe CP said, \u201cThe hotel later reported to the police about the development and released to us the telephone number he (West) dropped with the hotel. We began to track him on his phone, and with God on our side, he was arrested along Bori, Ogoni axis, on East-West Road while he was on his way to Akwa Ibom, on Thursday afternoon. Men of the command\u2019s Special Anti-Robbery Squad were on their usual stop-and-search duties when they intercepted a commercial bus heading towards Uyo, Akwa Ibom State.\n\n\u201cWhen they asked the passengers in a vehicle to disembark for a search, they saw the suspect in the same attire (a T-shirt and blue trousers) he wore in the viral video. The SARS team called my attention to it on the phone and I asked that he should be brought straight to my office.\n\n\u201cThe moment he stepped into my office, I called him by his name, David West and he answered. He then said to me, \u2018Please sir, I am ready to tell you the truth, I don\u2019t want any problem.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt was at that point that I directed that they unlock his handcuffs so that he could relax and be free to talk and give me all the necessary information that I needed. During the interrogation, he confessed that majority of the killings in hotels were done by him. To be sure of what he said, we asked him to name the hotels where he had killed.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Apprentice commits suicide three months after boyfriend killed self\n\n\u201cHe brought out the list which matched with the hotels where the killings took place in the state. He also said he was a member of De-gbam cult.\u201d\n\nWest, according to the police commissioner, did not have a gun, but killed his victims by tying and strangling them.\n\nDandaura said the suspect also confessed to funding his stay in hotels with the money he illegally got from his victims\u2019 debit cards.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.
