General Assembly as the furor over the call and a bombshell whistleblower complaint began to build. Over the course of this week, the scandal has prompted impeachment proceedings against Trump and is exposing Zelensky to criticism and claims of corruption.\n\nRELATED: The Trump-Ukraine controversy, and the Jews involved, explained\n\nBut Zelensky\u2019s trip was unusual for other reasons, too.\n\nFor Zelensky, a former television star and comedian who won the presidency in May in a landslide, the visit also involved his first General Assembly address. Still, he put aside time to meet at a gathering of dozens of Jewish community leaders \u2014 including Chabad rabbis, American Jewish Congress President Jack Rosen and Eric Goldstein, the CEO of UJA-Federation of New York \u2014 at a New York hotel.\n\nEchoing the argument of many Ukrainians who downplay the resurgence of anti-Semitic violence and vandalism in Ukraine, Zelensky told his hosts, according to the Federation of Jewish Communities of Ukraine, which organized the meeting: \u201cTo those who ask about anti-Semitism in Ukraine, just look at me.\u201d\n\nHe is, after all, Ukraine\u2019s first Jewish president.\n\nRELATED: Ukraine\u2019s next president is a Jewish comedian\n\nZelensky even found the time to meet a fellow Jewish-Ukrainian performer: Mila Kunis.\n\nWhen the movie star was 7, her parents \u2014 Mark, a mechanical engineer, and Elvira, a physics teacher \u2014 decided to move from Ukraine to the United States with her and her brother, Michael. But Kunis, whom Esquire in 2012 crowned \u201cSexiest Woman Alive,\u201d still speaks Russian.\n\nShe even visited her hometown of Chernivtsi in 2017, though she was unable to enter her childhood home because the owners wouldn\u2019t let her and her husband, Ashton Kutcher, into the apartment.\n\n(Last week, the Jewish organization Limmud FSU pulled off what its founder, Chaim Chesler, termed a \u201ccorrection\u201d to that experience: He organized a visit to the Kunis\u2019 apartment by dozens of participants of Limmud FSU Chernivtsi, with the consent of the owners. \u201cA proud Jewish woman, she\u2019s a role model for participants of our Jewish learning conferences,\u201d he said.)\n\nHowever, if Zelensky had hoped his meeting with Kunis, and Kutcher, would offer an escape from the political scandal brewing around him, he was quickly corrected.\n\nAfter the meeting, Kutcher did have kind words for the Ukraine leader.\n\n\u201cMy gut: He is committed to eliminating corruption in Ukraine,\u201d Kutcher said. \u201cHe\u2019s also committed to ending the war [with Russia] and grateful for the U.S. financial commitment because they needed it.\u201d\n\nBut the actor, who is not ethnically Jewish but reportedly follows Kabbalah and keeps kosher, wasn\u2019t so kind to Trump. He encouraged his Twitter users to receive his thoughts on the scandal to their cellphones by texting a number he provided.\n\n\u201cIf our president used that financial aid to leverage president Zelensky to investigate Biden,\u201d Kutcher said, \u201che should be impeached.\u201d"}}
