After two weeks of me plotting, Mr. Bennett finally agreed to meet me after his concert at the Melody Tent. I was so anxious I couldn\u2019t remember my first name.\n\nI wrote an article about our meeting for the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, so that others like myself, with spinal cord injuries, might consider stepping out of their comfort zones. Mr. Bennett was truly moved to know his kind gesture of meeting me could have a profound effect on hundreds, if not thousands, of disabled people.\n\nIt was an evening only dreams are made of.\n\nSo, at the Pops, I took a deep breath. Gripping my cane with my right hand, and Bob\u2019s arm with my left, we strode right past the VIP tables.\n\nA security guard stopped us. \u201cI\u2019m here to meet the conductor,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cAnd you are \u2013 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am Saralee Perel.\u201d\n\nHe was not blown away.\n\nHe pointed to Barnstable Town Hall. With fake assuredness, Bob and I ducked under roped-off areas and marched to that building.\n\nAfter seven more officials stopped us, I said, \u201cLet\u2019s just go back to our seats.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re giving up?\u201d That\u2019s all I needed to hear. I approached an orchestra member who led us into Town Hall, then asked us to wait.\n\nWaiting made my anxiety soar. My hands shake when I\u2019m scared. All of me does. For 10 minutes, Bob rubbed my back.\n\nA guy in a blue shirt had been standing silently in front of me. He could easily have overheard Bob saying, \u201cPicture him naked.\u201d\n\nI looked at the guy with a questioning, \u201cWho are you?\u201d expression on my face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the conductor.\u201d\n\nSpacing out, I did not put two and two together. He could tell I was confused, so he said, \u201cI\u2019m Keith Lockhart.\u201d\n\nOh Lord, was I mortified.\n\nBefore I could reach out to shake his hand, he warmly held out his.\n\nHe was so instantly likable; I felt like we\u2019d been friends for years.\n\nI told him I\u2019d be writing about our meeting in my next Cape Cod Times column. With genuine eagerness, (This fellow could not pull off anything that\u2019s not genuine.) he said, \u201cI\u2019ll look for it on September 6th.\u201d\n\nBefore Bob took our picture, Keith ever-so-gently put his arm around my shoulders.\n\nI said, \u201cDo you still get excited doing what you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I stop being excited it\u2019ll be time for me to retire. And I have no intent to retire.\u201d\n\nThis world-renowned innovative genius is really (like every great person should be) an ordinary guy.\n\nI can just picture him, today, reading this column, maybe over coffee with his feet up. I hope that my words convey to him how meaningful our time together was, and how I now have unforgettable memories.\n\nAnd so, the best part of my summer? Not the beach nor the barbecues.\n\nThe best part, of course, was hanging out with the maestro.\n\nAward-winning columnist Saralee Perel can be reached at sperel@saraleeperel.com or via her website: www.SaraleePerel.com.
