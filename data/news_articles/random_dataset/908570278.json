REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nThe new round of EU-UK talks start on Monday, and Barnier said Britain had to accept so-called level-playing field guarantees of fair competition to gain \u201csuper preferential access\u201d to the EU market of 450 million people.\n\n\u201cThe UK says that it wants Canada. But the problem with that is that the UK is not Canada,\u201d Barnier told an event at the European Parliament.\n\nThis is because of Britain\u2019s proximity to the EU and the much larger trade volumes it has with the EU than with Canada, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to offer the UK super preferential access to our own markets,\u201d he said, adding it would be \u201cunprecedented\u201d for any foreign country.\n\n\u201cIs this really something we can do without firm guarantees that the UK will respect the level playing field and avoid unfair competitive advantages? The answer, I\u2019m afraid, is simple: we cannot.\u201d\n\nBarnier said the EU would never risk unravelling the single market and that modern trade deals were also about labour, environmental, competition and other sustainability standards.\n\nHe warned Britain not to disregard agreements already sealed between the two sides as part of their divorce proceedings on the level playing field, the Irish border and future cooperation on foreign policy and defence.\n\nBritain left the EU last month after nearly five decades and Barnier stressed there would be tangible change from 2021 when the current status-quo transition ends.\n\n\u201cFrom January 1, 2021 there will be checks on all UK goods entering the single market,\u201d he said, adding that France and the Netherlands across the English Channel from Britain have each hired an extra 700 customs officials and Belgium added 400."}}
