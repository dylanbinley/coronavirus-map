Upon checking the weapon, they found the gun had a magazine with one pellet in it.\n\nPossessing an imitation firearm in public is an offence under the Firearms Act 1968.\n\nAt Leicester Magistrates\u2019 Court, Bosneac pleaded guilty to the charge, although she denied a claim by the witness that she had pointed the gun at another member of the public.\n\nThe case will now go to Leicester Crown Court where a special hearing will take place to enable a judge to hear from witnesses and decide whether Bosneac really did point the gun at someone.\n\nDuring Friday\u2019s hearing at the magistrates' court, prosecutor Sukhy Basi said: \u201cIt was on August 31 at about 8.10pm when a woman was walking from Narborough Road to her car, which was parked in Tudor Road.\n\n\u201cShe noticed three people \u2013 this defendant and two males \u2013 walking towards her in the same direction as two other women who were ahead of them.\n\n\u201cAs the witness got in her car she saw the defendant holding a handgun and pointing it to the back of one of the two females who were about 15 metres away from the defendant.\n\n\u201cThe witness drove up the road and reversed in Bosworth Street and phoned the police.\n\n\u201cAt that point the defendant was pointing the gun towards some bushes.\n\n\u201cThe armed police arrived and conducted a search. They saw the defendant smoking a cigarette, walking towards Braunstone Gate. Another armed police vehicle arrived and the officers got into position.\n\nShe had 'no idea it was against the law'\n\n\u201cAn officer saw the defendant had a black handgun pointed at the ground and he shouted \u2018gun\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe police believed the handgun was real and they were shocked by the manner in which she was carrying it.\n\n\u201cOfficers told her to get on the floor and she did comply.\u201d\n\nBosneac explained to the police that she had no idea it was against the law to carry an imitation firearm. Mr Basi said Bosneac, who is Romanian, had no previous convictions in this country.\n\n\u201cShe said she had suggested going to the park to do target practice,\u201d he said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know it was an offence to have it in a public place.\n\n\u201cShe agreed in interview someone could fear for their safety but she didn\u2019t admit causing anyone any fear of harm.\u201d\n\nRajesh Sood, representing Bosneac, said: \u201cThe prosecution case is there was a loaded firearm being pointed at the head of someone. This is disputed by her.\u201d\n\nThe court clerk advised the magistrates that whether or not Bosneac accepted aiming the gun at someone else, the matter was serious enough to be sent to Leicester Crown Court for the next step.\n\nChairman of the bench Vena Raja told Bosneac: \u201cBecause of the seriousness of this case we\u2019re sending this to Leicester Crown Court and the judge will decide how to proceed.\u201d\n\nThe case is due to be heard at the crown court next month."}}
