According to the reports, the app offered a real-time location of Hong Kong police vehicles, special tactical police, location of tear gas firings along with directions for protestors to move. The information was reportedly crowdsourced through social media tools like Telegram. The company removed the app from its store earlier this month but had allowed its access after a few days.\n\nPeople\u2019s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, published an article Wednesday that said Apple was \u201cLetting poisonous software have its way,\u201d and that it was \u201ca betrayal of the Chinese people\u2019s feelings.\u201d\n\nAmid pressure from the Chinese government and multiple conglomerates, Apple decided to withdraw the app.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, the multinational technology company said, \u201cWe created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps. We have learned that an app, HKmap.live, has been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong. Many concerned customers in Hong Kong have contacted us about this app and we immediately began investigating it. The app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know that there is no law enforcement. The app violates our guidelines and local laws, and we have removed it from the App Store.\u201d\n\nDenying the allegation, the HKmap.live developer said in a statement Thursday that \"there is zero evidence to support CSTCB\u2019s accusations.\u201d\n\nThe app \"never solicits, promotes, or encourages criminal activity,\u201d and that, \u201cHKmap app consolidates information from users and public sources, e.g. live news stream, Facebook and Telegram,\" the developer added.\n\nThe protests in Hong Kong began earlier this year with the aim to oppose the introduction of the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill proposed by the government. If enacted, the law would have allowed the extradition of those convicted of crimes to mainland China and Taiwan."}}
