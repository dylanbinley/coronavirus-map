The production-ready model is expected to make its debut later this year, before going on sale in 2021 as a rival for upcoming electric SUVs like the Volkswagen ID.4 and Skoda Enyak.\n\nThe 45 concept was revealed as an homage to the company\u2019s first ever concept \u2013 the 1974 Pony Coupe. The production model will be the first car based on the Hyundai Group\u2019s new scalable electric car platform, similar to the Volkswagen Group\u2019s MEB system. In the coming years it will underpin a range of new EVs across the Hyundai, Kia and Genesis brands.\n\n\u2022 Best electric cars on sale now\n\nFrom its unveiling, the Hyundai 45 concept was said to be a close representation of the eventual production model \u2013 and initial impressions suggest the rumours were accurate.\n\nNaturally, some of the concept\u2019s sharper angles have been toned down in the interest of pedestrian safety \u2013 but this mule and Hyundai\u2019s show car share the same basic silhouette, the same tailgate spoiler, a similar radiator grille, comparable front and rear lamps and a near-identical set of alloy wheels."}}
