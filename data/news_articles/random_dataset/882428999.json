Get out! Let us see a (functioning) state,\" said one protester, referring to perceived cronyism and corruption in the country.\n\n\"We don't want anything, just let us live,\" he added as puffs of smoke from tear gas rose behind him.\n\nOil-rich Iraq is OPEC's second-highest producer -- but one in five people live below the poverty line and youth unemployment sits at 25 percent, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe staggering rates of joblessness and allegations of corruption sparked the widespread protests on October 1 and the government has struggled to quell public anger by offering reform plans.\n\nPrime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi has suggested a laundry list of measures, including hiring drives, increased pensions and a cabinet reshuffle.\n\nNew education and health ministers were approved by parliament in a session earlier this month, the only time it was able to reach quorum since protests began.\n\n- 'They tricked us' -\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi has suggested a laundry list of measures to quell public anger, including hiring drives and a cabinet reshuffle, but protesters seemed unimpressed -, AFP\n\nBut protesters seemed unimpressed.\n\n\"They told young people: 'go home, we'll give you pensions and come up with a solution'. They tricked us,\" said one of the rare woman protesters on Saturday, her young son at her side.\n\nAbout 60 percent of Iraq's 40-million-strong population is under the age of 25.\n\nProtesters have directed some of their anger at the country's top Shiite religious authority, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who is deeply revered among most Iraqis.\n\nOthers have been waiting for signal from influential populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has thrown his weight behind protests.\n\nOn Friday, Sistani urged protesters and security forces to show \"restraint\", warning of \"chaos\" if violence resumed.\n\n\"Sadr, Sistani -- this is a shame,\" a protester in Tahrir said on Saturday.\n\n\"We were hit! It's enough,\" he said, waving a tear gas canister fired earlier by security forces.\n\nRiot police had been trying to keep protesters around Tahrir from reaching the high-security Green Zone across the river, which hosts government offices including parliament.\n\nLawmakers are scheduled to meet there at 1:00 pm (1000 GMT) to \"discuss protesters' demands, cabinet's decisions and the implementation of reforms.\"\n\nSpeaker Mohammed al-Halbusi said he had visited Tahrir overnight, but many demonstrators have shunned the participation of mainstream politicians whom they see as trying to co-opt their movement.\n\n- Political plays -\n\nIraqi women mourn for a demonstrator who was killed the previous day in anti-government protests in during his funeral -, AFP\n\nThere were calls for fresh protests in the south as well despite authorities announcing curfews across several provinces on Saturday.\n\nMany expected a public outcry from the families of those killed the previous day as they prepared for their burials.\n\nLate Friday, 12 protesters died in the southern city of Diwaniyah alone while setting fire to the headquarters of the powerful Badr organisation, part of the Hashed paramilitary faction.\n\n\"Public anger is directed at them in addition to governorate councils, for they were the obvious face of 'the regime',\" wrote Harith Hasan, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center.\n\nBut it was also a chance for Sadr to swipe at his rivals in the Hashed.\n\n\"The Sadrists, especially in their traditional strongholds such as Missan, saw this an opportunity to act against competing militias,\" such as Asaib Ahl al-Haq, Badr, and Kataeb Hezbollah, Hasan said on Twitter."}}
