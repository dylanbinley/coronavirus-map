In his 20-year career in technology, he has also held executive positions at C-bridge Internet Solutions, Sun Microsystems and Think Big Analytics.\n\n\u201cI am thrilled to join Protegrity to help the company scale into the future with its industry leading security software,\u201d Farnell said in a statement. \u201cData security is a top concern in boardrooms and for C-suites at companies of all sizes and in every industry across the globe. As the world increasingly adopts digital, hybrid-cloud and artificial-intelligence solutions, Protegrity\u2019s proven data security software will be on center stage helping our customers to choreograph safe analytical innovation with the use of data in all its forms.\u201d\n\nFarnell replaces Suni Munshani, who had served as CEO since 2011.\n\nProtegrity officials declined to comment on whether Munshani resigned or was terminated as chief executive.\n\nIn response to a Hearst Connecticut Media inquiry, Munshani said in a LinkedIn message that he supported the appointment of Farnell. He said he was still working at Protegrity but that he was \u201cworking on a transition over the next few weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company is ready for its next phase of growth and replacement of CEOs is normal,\u201d Munshani added. \u201cRick\u2019s background and experiences match well with what Protegrity needs now. I wish well in building a billion-dollar company.\u201d\n\nAmong the challenges that Protegrity tackled under Munshani\u2019s leadership, the firm helped clients repel the global WannaCry cyber attack that struck in the spring of 2017.\n\n\u201cIf attackers do get to the data \u2014 which is the \u2018holy grail,\u2019 the \u2018gold\u2019 they\u2019re after \u2014 they can do nothing with it when it\u2019s being protected with Protegrity technology,\u201d Munshani said in an interview at the time. \u201cOnce the data is protected, it\u2019s completely useless to those bad actors.\u201d\n\nThe company does not publicly disclose its clients, but its website says they include seven of the world\u2019s 15 largest banks, the \u201cNo. 1 large provider of healthcare insurance\u201d and \u201cfive of the most powerful transnational companies.\u201d\n\nProtegrity\u2019s main offices are located at 333 Ludlow St., in the city\u2019s South End.\n\npschott@stamfordadvocate.com; 203-964-2236; twitter: @paulschott"}}
