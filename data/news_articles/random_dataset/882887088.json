They asked whether this was the BJP\u2019s new \u201cversion of Indian nationalism\u201d.\n\n\u201cGovernment rolling out the red carpet (for) EU MPs to briefing them and inviting them to visit Jammu and Kashmir is a disrespect to the sovereignty of the Indian Parliament and the violation of the privileges of Indian MPs,\u201d former Union minister Anand Sharma, who heads the Congress foreign affairs department, tweeted.\n\n\u201cWhen leaders of Opposition and members of Parliament went to Srinagar, they were detained and not allowed to meet any individual or community organisations.\u201d\n\nSharma added: \u201cThis stand of the government is self-defeating and contradicts our consistent position that J&K is India\u2019s internal matter. Is this the new version of Indian nationalism?\u201d\n\nThe BJP had earlier kicked up a storm when some members of the Overseas Congress \u2014 a department of the Congress party \u2014 met a British MP who claimed they had discussed Kashmir. The Centre and the BJP attacked the Congress, which clarified it had sanctioned no such mission.\n\nAnother Congress leader and former Union minister, Jairam Ramesh, tweeted: \u201cWhen Indian political leaders have been prevented from meeting the people of J&K, what possessed the great chest-beating champion of nationalism to allow European politicians to visit J&K? This is an outright insult to India\u2019s own Parliament and our democracy!\u201d\n\nThe European MPs\u2019 proposed visit has handed the Congress ammunition to accuse the government and the BJP of duplicity on the subject of Kashmir being an internal matter.\n\nBoth Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah had attacked the Congress for criticising the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s special status, asking whether or not they saw Kashmir as India\u2019s internal matter.\n\nMany Congress leaders have underlined that the visiting group of European MPs is dominated by members of far-Right parties.\n\nThey have also recalled how CPM leader Sitaram Yechury had to petition the Supreme Court to be able to enter Srinagar and how Rahul Gandhi, leading an Opposition delegation, was sent back from Srinagar airport.\n\nFormer Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad was sent back twice. The Opposition parties were not allowed to even hold a news conference in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nEven the local politicians in Kashmir, including former chief ministers, are in detention and cannot move around the state.\n\nKartarpur\n\nThe Congress has formed a delegation to visit Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan on November 8 after the inauguration of the Kartarpur Corridor.\n\nThe delegation will include former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, R.P.N. Singh, Asha Kumari, Randeep Surjewala, Deepender Hooda and Jitin Prasada."}}
