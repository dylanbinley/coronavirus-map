As of 1 January 2020, employers cannot use employee salary sacrificed contributions to fulfil employer SG commitments.\n\n\u201cThe IPA had originally advocated for the measure to be brought forward from its proposed start date of 1 July 2020 to the start of this financial year, namely 1 July 2019.\n\n\u201cWe were pleased that the Senate at least partly agreed with our position, and recommended the measure be brought forward to 1 January 2020.\u201d\n\nSG loophole measure now in force Jotham Lian Last Updated: 20 January 2020 Published: 20 January 2020"}}
