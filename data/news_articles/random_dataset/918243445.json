Because this is related to layoffs and social repercussions.\u201d\n\nThe IMF on Tuesday released its new World Economic Outlook titled \u201cThe Great Lockdown\u201d, estimating Indonesia\u2019s economic growth to plunge to 0.5 percent this year from a four-year low of 5.02 percent in 2019.\n\nThe IMF also projects that the country\u2019s unemployment rate will rise to 7.5 percent this year, from last year\u2019s 5.3 percent as the pandemic has upended supply chains, forcing companies to lay off employees, and crushed demand for goods as consumers stay at home.\n\nAs many as 2.8 million people have lost their jobs as of Monday, according to data from the Manpower Ministry and the Workers Social Security Agency (BPJS Ketenagakerjaan). More than half were furloughed and placed on paid or unpaid leave.\n\n\u201cThe significant downward revision to the 2020 growth projection reflects large anticipated domestic disruptions to economic activity from COVID-19,\u201d the report says. The IMF expects the virus to hit Indonesia\u2019s economy as the country relies heavily on the export of commodities rather than finished goods.\n\n\u201cAmong developing economies, all countries face a health crisis, severe external demand shock, dramatic tightening in global financial conditions, and a plunge in commodity prices,\u201d the report says. \u201cThey will have a severe impact on economic activity in commodity exporters.\u201d\n\nHowever, the IMF expects that recovery will take place in 2021 as the country\u2019s economy may expand by 8.2 percent, the highest since 1995 during former president Soeharto\u2019s leadership.\n\nThe global economy is projected to contract by 3 percent this year, but growth is expected to recover in 2021 with a projected rate of 5.8 percent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt is very likely that this year the global economy will experience its worst recession since the Great Depression, surpassing that seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago,\u201d IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath said. \u201cWorse growth outcomes are possible and even likely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis would follow if the pandemic and containment measures last longer, emerging and developing economies are even more severely hit [\u2026] or if widespread scarring effects emerge due to firm closures and extended unemployment,\u201d she added.\n\nThe highly contagious novel coronavirus has infected more than 1.9 million people and killed over 119,000. In Indonesia, more than 4,500 people have tested positive for COVID-19 so far, while at least 399 have died.\n\nPresident Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo has declared a public health emergency and a national disaster as large-scale social restrictions are in place in several regions with high numbers of confirmed cases.\n\n\u201cThe economic growth target for 2020 will be corrected sharply, but this will not happen only in Indonesia but also in other countries,\u201d Jokowi said on Tuesday. \u201cWe must prepare ourselves for every scenario and work very hard for public health recovery and economic recovery.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s baseline scenario is for Indonesia\u2019s economic growth to drop to 2.3 percent, the lowest in 21 years, with a worst-case scenario of an economic contraction of 0.4 percent.\n\nFor more news about the novel coronavirus click here.\n\nWhat you need to know about Coronavirus.\n\nFor more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.\n\nThe Inquirer Foundation supports our healthcare frontliners and is still accepting cash donations to be deposited at Banco de Oro (BDO) current account #007960018860 or donate through PayMaya using this link .\n\nRead Next\n\nEDITORS' PICK\n\nMOST READ"}}
