Col. Carla Gleason, a Pentagon spokeswoman.\n\nNeither the State Department nor the Pentagon described how they would hold Russia accountable.\n\nAD\n\nJohn Hultquist, the director of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm FireEye, said it was significant that Pompeo had officially tied Sandworm hackers to GRU Unit 74455. The Justice Department has previously said that 74455 took part in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign in 2016.\n\nAD\n\nBritain said in a separate statement that its national cybersecurity center had assessed \u201cwith the highest level of probability\u201d that the attack was carried out by Russia and called it \u201cpart of Russia\u2019s long-running campaign of hostile and destabilising activity against Georgia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe GRU\u2019s reckless and brazen campaign of cyber attacks against Georgia, a sovereign and independent nation, is totally unacceptable,\u201d said British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.\n\nAD\n\nThe Australian government also issued a statement condemning the \u201cmalicious cyber activity by Russia targeting the state of Georgia in October last year.\u201d\n\nSenior Georgian officials expressed thanks for the support.\n\n\u201cLast October, #Georgia suffered a reckless cyber attack affecting state, media & business entities,\u201d Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia said in a tweet. \u201cThis was an intolerable act attempting to undermine our sovereignty. We deeply appreciate the vocal support from our partners & allies around the world.\u201d\n\nThe pointed statements come as senior American officials express concern about the vulnerability of U.S. elections to hacking.\n\nIn December, President Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in the Oval Office and said he warned Moscow not to interfere in U.S. elections."}}
