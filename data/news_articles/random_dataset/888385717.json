They are ancient mountains, formed of pale granite and gneiss, their slopes densely wooded with pines of several species: black pines, maritime pines, sentry pines, Scots pines. To visit them is to be able to recall the scents of those days and nights, even years on: \u2018the piney smell of \u2026 crushed needles\u2019, as Ernest Hemingway puts it in for Whom the Bell Tolls, \u2018and the sharper odour of \u2026 resinous sap\u2019.\n\n\u201cHemingway\u2019s novel is set in the Guadarrama during the last May of the Spanish Civil War. Its hero is Robert Jordan, a young American fighting for the International Brigade. Jordan, an explosives expert with a profound dis\u00adinterest in his own fate, is tasked by his Soviet commander with destroying a bridge in the Fascist-held mountains. He joins forces with Republican par\u00adtisans who have gone guerrilla. Their base for the operation is a cave in the \u2018rim-rock\u2019 at the \u2018cup-shaped upper end\u2019 of a \u2018little valley\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn the book\u2019s second paragraph, Jordan unfolds a photostatted map on the \u2018pine-needle floor\u2019 of the forest. That contrast between military percep\u00adtion and natural presence preoccupies Hemingway throughout the novel. The landscapes of the Guadarrama are interpreted chiefly in terms of tactics: open ground is read for its lines of fire, \u2018timber\u2019 for its cover. Those with close knowledge of the range \u2014 like Jordan\u2019s trusted guide Anselmo \u2014 are valuable because they can move discreetly through this hostile territory. Yet these tough men remain alert to the beauty of the mountains. When a two-day blizzard blows in, Jordan relishes its wildness, though he knows it will betray their position. Pilar, a fellow partisan, agrees: \u2018What rotten stuff is the snow and how beautiful it looks.\u2019 The hurry-up-and-wait aspects of war mean there is time to appreciate the \u2018afternoon clouds \u2026 moving slowly in the high Spanish sky\u2019. Maria, Jordan\u2019s lover, speaks of her passion for the pine forest: \u2018the feel of the needles under foot \u2026 the wind in the high trees and the creaking they make against each other: Even their target is assessed both aesthetically and militarily \u2014 it is a \u2018steel bridge of a single span\u2019, possessing a \u2018solid-flung metal grace\u2019,\u2019 standing \u2018dark against the steep emptiness of the gorge\u2019.\n\nMore here."}}
