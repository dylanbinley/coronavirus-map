In short, people will behave like cars.\n\nWestmount is the first place on Earth to try this daring plan. So once they\u2019re treating people like cars, what else can they do?\n\nWhy not forbid pedestrians from tailgating or making U-turns? Have them signal when turning, or wear brake lights in case of sudden stops?\n\nWestmount\u2019s experiment is understandable these days when no one\u2019s quite certain how to protect themselves from the virus. As fatalities and fear have spread, we are all COVID-confused about many things, like:\n\n1. Masks. For weeks, we were strongly warned not to wear masks by Canada\u2019s chief public health officer. Now, she\u2019s reversed herself, and strongly recommends them, at least for shopping \u2014 so we\u2019re reversing, too.\n\nSuddenly, many people are sewing masks, or making makeshift ones. Some wear yank-over-the-mouth turtlenecks, others use doubled-up underwear, sliced socks pulled over their heads and other bank-robber fashion.\n\nDonald Trump seems to be wearing a 24/7 sleep mask \u2014 over his eyes.\n\nI wore a sweaty winter neck warmer to a store, but my glasses fogged and I couldn\u2019t see the groceries. But it\u2019s probably best to wear one in supermarkets and anywhere else that makes you feel safe \u2014 even your bathroom.\n\nWhatever works is good for your isolationship.\n\n2. Distancing. Most people now stand six feet apart, except for covidiots. According to a recent Google study tracking cellphone locations, Quebecers are the North American champions at social distancing.\n\nStill, germ-nervous friends keep sending me websites warning we\u2019re really only safe at eight feet, or 18.\n\nNumerous readers sent me a scary new (academically unreviewed) Belgian biking study that claims we should be 20 metres behind other cyclists\u2019 airstreams \u2014 and five metres behind walkers.\n\nBut other medical experts think microscopic virus clouds dissipate instantly in any breeze \u2014 so brief outdoor contact is low risk.\n\nWho knows what\u2019s true? We need a version of that old high school physics formula:\n\n\u201cIf a moving object (a biker) travels 18 km/h and passes another moving object (a jogger) moving 5 km/h, with a crosswind of 7 km/h, how many nanoseconds will they be in contact and what is the risk of contracting coronavirus?\u201d\n\n3. Takeout. For my birthday last week, we ordered from a restaurant for the first time in ages, then obeyed the recommendations for handling take-out:\n\nA) Wash hands. B) Remove packaging. C) Transfer food to dishes. D) Throw packaging out, or destroy with small explosives. E) Disinfect, or dismantle counters any packaging has touched. F) Wash hands. Repeat.\n\nWe were delighted to support a local restaurant, but by the time we ate we could have cooked dinner.\n\n4. Survival strategies. Every morning, I studiously analyze two hours of news about the latest \u201ccurve\u201d in Italy, Spain, New York and South Korea compared to Canada and Quebec.\n\nThen I project the next day\u2019s and week\u2019s possible Quebec cases and divide by the square root of each day\u2019s forecasted temperature and the latest astrological table.\n\nI\u2019m a Type 1 who seeks safety in numbers: forecasting tomorrow makes me calm today.\n\nThis drives my Type 2 friends crazy. They hate thinking about the future and prefer the advice many psychiatrists suggest: \u201cLive in the now . Forget tomorrow because your can\u2019t control it.\u201d\n\nBut that philosophy would drive me crazy. Frankly, Type 1s and 2s are both fine \u2014 whatever works for you. But if you\u2019re a Type 1 and your spouse Type 2, it could be a reason this lockdown will end with covidivorces.\n\nBoth types sometimes survive by sending and receiving virus jokes \u2014 and readers have sent me countless, thanks.\n\nMy favourite: \u201cI haven\u2019t figured out where I\u2019m spending my summer holidays \u2014 in the living room, or the kitchen.\u201d\n\n5. Gatherings. Many people meet friends for socially responsible walks, six feet apart \u2014 a rare pleasure Quebec law has permitted.\n\nBut last week, over-vigilant Montreal police declared all personal gatherings were illegal and threatened tickets . This caused consternation and COVID-confusion among many strollers, banished to isolation and fearfully wondering: can I, or can\u2019t I?\n\nAfter many complaints by the public, it seems police were overzealous. Quebec\u2019s crown prosecutor told Radio-Canada the law still stands \u2014 and under the law you can walk with a \u201cdistant\u201d friend.\n\nCome on, officers. It\u2019s tough enough obeying the actual rules without adding imaginary ones.\n\nThat said, there were many huge indoor gatherings last week \u2014 for Passover seders, online on Zoom. Many people added a new item to the usual seder incantation about frogs, locusts and the other Ten Plagues.\n\nThe 11th plague: coronavirus.\n\nMany services also added: \u201cMay the plague pass over you after Passover.\u201d So hang in everyone, and let\u2019s hope the worst will soon be over for now, as Quebec authorities predict.\n\nUntil then, don\u2019t forget to honk if you walk past me on the sidewalk.\n\njoshfreed49@gmail.com\n\nRelated\n\nNote to readers: We know the speed and volume of coronavirus-related news is overwhelming and a little frightening.
