The facility, which will be located in Klaipeda Free Economic Zone (FEZ), will manufacture microduct systems for optical-fibre cables and is set to employ 55 specialists with a potential to expand in the future.\n\nThe REHAU group has an annual turnover of around $3.5 billion and is comprised of a range of different divisions. The new production unit in Klaipeda will be part of REHAU\u2019s Building Solutions division, which manufactures a range of polymer products including piping, fittings and polymer solutions for telecommunications. The output from REHAU\u2019s Klaipeda unit will mainly be going to wholesalers, telecommunications companies, and municipalities in countries across Europe. REHAU will be looking for a wide range of specialists for its Klaipeda operations, including managers, engineers and technicians, mechanics and electricians, administrative staff, machine operatives and warehouse staff.\n\nDr. Roger Sch\u00f6nborn, Head of Division Building Solutions, underlines: \u201eREHAU was considering a number of locations for its new facility across the CEE region before settling on Klaipeda. The strong pool of qualified talent and their professional attitude and work ethic was a major factor in REHAU\u2019s decision, as was the strong cost to quality ratio. In key fields, Lithuania remains highly cost competitive for manufacturers, yet it also boasts some of the most streamlined and business-friendly conditions in the EU.\u201c\n\nAs Mantas Katinas, Director General of Invest Lithuania, explains, German manufacturers are finding Lithuania\u2019s value proposition attractive. \u201cIn recent years, some of the largest manufacturers from Germany have established operations here, including Continental, Hella and now REHAU. The fact that Lithuania is trusted by such prestigious companies is a testament to the high level of our talent, infrastructure and business environment.\u201d"}}
