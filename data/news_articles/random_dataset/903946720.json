But the message he conveyed to his hosts stayed the same: Beware of China.\n\nIn his trip to Europe and Central Asia, Pompeo denounced China\u2019s human rights record, criticized its aggressive trade practices and urged his hosts to be wary of Chinese investment and influence. He warned that China poses a risk as countries develop next-generation, high-speed wireless networks.\n\nHis language was blunt. \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party presents the central threat of our times,\u201d Pompeo said last week in London, just days after the European Union unveiled security guidelines for 5G wireless networks that stop short of a ban on Huawei in the latest setback for the U.S. campaign against the Chinese tech company.\n\nPompeo\u2019s tough rhetoric, on a trip coinciding with the rapid spread of a new virus that originated in China and threatens global growth, underscores his preoccupation with the country and its recent diplomatic and trade victories.\n\nHis comments contrast with President Donald Trump\u2019s more conciliatory language on China. That\u2019s partly because Trump is working to complete a trade deal with President Xi Jinping. When he signed the first phase of the agreement last month, Trump called Xi a \u201cvery, very good friend of mine\u201d and said he planned to visit China in the not-too-distant future.\n\nTrump said then that he and Xi have \u201cdeveloped an incredible relationship.\u201d\n\nPompeo\u2019s comments in London, however, maintain the tough approach that he and Vice President Mike Pence have espoused about China, driven mainly by the country\u2019s repression of Muslims and ethnic minorities in its western Xinjiang Province, but also by what they say are Beijing\u2019s predatory trade practices and development projects that they say put small and poor countries at great risk.\n\nPompeo\u2019s visit to Britain came just 48 hours after the country, which is eagerly hoping to secure a massive post-Brexit trade deal with the U.S., ignored American threats and allowed Huawei to have a role in its 5G network.\n\nThe decision highlighted the limits of the Trump administration\u2019s ability to lobby for its policies as it defied a U.S. threat to sever intelligence sharing if Huawei had any presence. U.S. officials believe that the security of information on a network that uses Huawei technology or equipment could be compromised.\n\nStung by the British move but still hoping to retain and boost the U.S.-Britain \u201cspecial relationship,\u201d Pompeo appeared to step back from the threat on intelligence sharing, saying that he was certain a way could be found to avoid it.\n\nYet, he made clear that the Trump administration would continue to confront China on multiple fronts, including commerce, infrastructure and technology, militarily and diplomatically, even as the administration pursues a second phase of a massive deal to end a current trade war with Beijing.\n\nIn Central Asia, where three of the five nations share borders with western China, Pompeo denounced Chinese human rights abuses.\n\n\u201cThe United States urges all countries to join us in pressing for an immediate end to this repression,\u201d he said on Sunday in Kazakhstan. \u201cWe ask simply for them to provide safe refuge and asylum to those seeking to flee China; protect human dignity; just do what\u2019s right.\u201d"}}
