He said the results came back negative.\n\nThe other 168 reports have resulted in firefighters returning to work, almost immediately, and answering more calls after personnel, equipment and vehicles are sanitized.\n\n\u201cIf the employee has worn the appropriate issued protective gear and followed protocol, they will be considered low risk,\" HFD Chief Sam Pena said on Monday.\n\nPena\u2019s assessment appears to align with CDC guidelines.\n\nLancton said he does not argue that the specific point does maintain that the city of Houston\u2019s plan does not fully protect firefighters and could become a problem for the city with staffing levels already below minimum guidelines on some days.\n\n\u201cIf the question is do we have enough resources to handle this pandemic as we sit here today, I can tell you the answer is no,\u201d Lancton said on Monday.\n\nLancton said he is particularly concerned about what happens if a firefighter does get sick. He believes there is no true plan in place for safe quarantine of affected firefighters.\n\nSome other cities have set-up or are in the process of setting-up buildings dedicated to the care of first responders who are infected.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t go home where are we going to put them?\u201d Lancton asked.\n\nThe question was forwarded to Pena via email, but was not answered Monday afternoon.\n\nIn addition to staffing levels and isolation protocols, Lancton is concerned about the city\u2019s proccurement levels of masks for patients and gowns for first responders.\n\nPena said Monday more gowns are on the way.\n\nAfter the story initially aired Monday, HFD Public Information Officer Sheldra Brigham offered total numbers that varied from HPFFA:\n\n\u201cSince Friday afternoon, about 120 members reported as low risk. Three reported as medium risk. Of those, two cleared risk while at the hospital and one self-quarantine for testing and has since cleared. No high risk reported.\u201d"}}
