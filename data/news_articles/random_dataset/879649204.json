He was credited with developing the curriculum for a plastics class and also taught electronics classes.\n\nIn 1977 he moved with his family from Rochester to Wadena where they built a home designed by his son Jeffrey just a couple miles from Wadena in Otter Tail County, over the years Bob showed his other woodworking abilities by making many fine pieces of furniture, still in use. Bob was hired by the New York Mills based Community Action Council and served as a weatherization inspector from 1980 until 2011 when the office at NYM was closed. He was appointed to and served on the Otter Tail County Planning Commission from 1982 until 2018 when he had to resign due to health reasons.

He enjoyed traveling, and when young, camping. He built a camper for his pickup truck and the family often traveled and camped in northern and western states and Canadian provinces. Trips to Europe planned by Jeffrey were enjoyed in more recent years. One especially enjoyed was a \u201csurprise\u201d visit to the Austrian ski village where he and army buddies had skied when they would get three-day passes. Bob enjoyed hunting and fishing. In \u201881 he bagged a moose during one of many Canadian hunting trips with Jim Taggart, Bob Rowan, Paul Kingsley, and Jerome Hiltner.
