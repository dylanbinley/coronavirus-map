Mr Orb\u00e1n replied instead, calling it \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nThe Finnish PM did however express optimism over Hungary\u2019s willingness to push for stronger climate protection measures.\n\nThe Finnish EU Council presidency aims to get an EU-wide agreement on decarbonisation by 2050. In June, such an attempt was vetoed in the European Council by the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, which have insisted on compensation mechanisms.\n\n\u2014\n\nPhoto: 444"}}
