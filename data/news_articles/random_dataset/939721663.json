When she saw the affects of the coronavirus pandemic, Tomasetti headed straight into one of the country\u2019s COVID-19 hotspots to help.\n\nFor a month in April, fresh out of anesthesia school, Tomasetti worked in the COVID intensive care units at Mount Sinai West Hospital in New York City and Morristown Medical Center in New Jersey. Tomasetti said sometimes the decision to act is the hardest. But no matter her fears, she knew she was the woman for the job.\n\n\u201cMost people asked me if I was scared (to work there). Of course I was scared, but I was made to do this,\u201d she said. \u201cI was trained to do this. I couldn\u2019t stand by on the sidelines and watch this virus take more lives, and I couldn\u2019t expect my colleagues and other health care professionals to do everything while I stood by. We don\u2019t accomplish things in life by wishing for them; we accomplish things by working for it.\u201d\n\nThe daughter of Richard and Beverly Tomasetti, she felt inspired to head into medicine thanks to another compassionate nurse \u2014 her mom, who worked in Mercy Hospital\u2019s ICU and then earned a master\u2019s degree with a nurse practitioner certification. Tomasetti knew her mom cared for people all day while also raising three children and advancing her career.\n\n\u201cI remember it was when I graduated with my master\u2019s degree that the three of them, especially Maria, they were looking at me like, \u2018Mommy\u2019s pretty cool,\u2019\u201d Beverly Tomasetti said, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever realized the impact it had on her.\u201d\n\nThrough her mother, Tomasetti also realized the connection nurses have with patients as well as families. She wanted to help people the way her mother did.\n\n\u201cMy mom was and always will be my hero,\u201d Tomasetti said.\n\nAfter graduating from Old Forge High School, Tomasetti earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing from University of Pittsburgh and took a job in a combined pediatric ICU/pediatric cardiac ICU at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore. This marked her first experience working with the most vulnerable patients, caring for kids undergoing open-heart surgery or who had severe trauma. She saw first-hand how compassion truly can affect patients and their families.\n\n\u201cYou are their advocate,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a time of crisis, the parents often look to the nurses not only for high-quality care but (also) guidance and hope. I knew I could offer them that.\u201d\n\nTomasetti\u2019s experience there motivated her to go back to school to become a nurse anesthetist, an advanced practice nurse who administers anesthesia for surgery or other medical procedures. She enrolled at Rutgers University for the doctoral program, where mentor Nirja Patel asked her to join a mission trip to Haiti in May 2019 with a group of nurses, surgeons and an anesthesiologist from St. Barnabas Medical Center, New Jersey. Tomasetti jumped at the chance.\n\n\u201cVolunteering abroad was an invaluable experience that goes beyond the depths of anesthesia,\u201d she said, noting she volunteered in Haiti again in February and would love to return.\n\nSeeing the differences between Haiti and the United States firsthand was like nothing she ever experienced. Some people she treated walked miles just to receive medical care.\n\n\u201cThe global aspect of this mission trip was something that I will always value,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing able to gain an understanding of the different cultures and traditions of the people that I was serving was extremely important in order to deliver the highest level of care.\u201d\n\nWhen she returned from her most recent Haiti trip, the coronavirus pandemic was just beginning in the United States. In her final semester of anesthesia school at the time, Tomasetti finished early thanks to the virus.\n\nLike most of the country, Tomasetti heard of COVID-19 on the news, but she didn\u2019t understand the severity of it until she saw its affects in nearby New York City. She also saw the desperate need for ICU nurses to care for COVID-19 patients and knew her experience made her readily equipped to help. She also had her own family on her mind.\n\n\u201cI knew that if one of my loved ones became infected with COVID-19, I would want the best possible care for them,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was my main motivation for doing it. I have to do something. I can\u2019t just stand by.\u201d\n\nTomasetti, along with friend and roommate Lara Mendoza, started shifts in the COVID ICUs at both Mount Sinai West and Morristown Medical Center. Each day, Tomasetti donned two gowns, two pairs of gloves, an N95 respirator mask, a mask over that and a shield.\n\nAt Mount Sinai, with no ICU beds left and a rapid increase of cases in March and April, the post-anesthesia care unit was converted to an ICU. Normally in the ICU, Tomasetti explained, a nurse would care for one or two patients at most. With a shortage of resources and ICU-trained nurses, though, those who wouldn\u2019t normally care for patients on ventilators, for instance, were asked to care for up to four ICU-level patients at a time. The days also were long \u2014 usually 12- to 15-hour shifts \u2014 and stressful. Tomasetti received frequent virus tests (she was always negative), and thinking about the virus nonstop took a mental toll.\n\nEven so, no one would talk Tomasetti out of doing the job, her mother noted.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always been strong-willed and self-assured, even as a kid,\u201d Beverly Tomasetti said. \u201cWhen she makes up her mind to do something, she\u2019s doing it. Of course we were worried \u2014 any parent would \u2014 but it\u2019s a really selfless and amazing thing to do. I admire her for that.\u201d\n\nThe effects of COVID-19 extend beyond just the lungs, Tomasetti said. Many patients required continuous medications to maintain their blood pressure and heart rate or to prevent blood clots from forming. None of Tomasetti\u2019s patients fit neatly into boxes.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 does not discriminate,\u201d she said, adding wearing face masks or coverings as well as practicing social distancing and good hand hygiene are ways to stay safe and healthy. \u201cIt does not care how old you are, the color of your skin, your past medical history, your weight or where you came from. I saw patients making strides only to have a setback that they were never able to recover from. I also saw patients who we never thought would improve who are now home with their loved ones. \u2026 I\u2019ve never experienced anything like it.\u201d\n\nTomasetti and other health care team members collaborated extensively. To ensure patients\u2019 safety, they continuously monitored ventilators, sedation and more and made sure patients got the right medications.\n\n\u201cYou truly never sat down,\u201d Tomasetti said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much going on, and every time you finish with one patient, there\u2019s something happening with another. With four patients who were all medically sedated and intubated, you are far too busy to stop and think.\u201d\n\nEveryone pitched in to do their part, though, Tomasetti said. Frontline workers really went above and beyond the call of duty, working double shifts or several days in a row without breaks.\n\n\u201cWorking with such a professional and compassionate group of people is something I will never forget,\u201d she said. \u201cIndividuals who have never cared for an ICU patient jumped right in and did whatever they could to help. It was inspiring.\u201d\n\nSo were the patients who pulled through. Tomasetti cared for a man in his 40s with COVID who had to be intubated. He had no significant past medical history or preexisting conditions and was active, healthy and involved in the community.\n\n\u201cMy heart ached for his family,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew if the virus could infect him, it could infect anyone.\u201d\n\nFortunately, Tomasetti watched him turn the corner and was his nurse the day his breathing tube was taken out. As he grew stronger, he got to video chat with his family for the first times in weeks. To see happy families filled with gratitude reunite in that way made Tomasetti know what she did was worth it.\n\n\u201cThose were some of the best moments,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were a lot of hard days, tougher than probably anything I\u2019ve ever experienced, but it was those moments of hope and happiness that made all of us feel just a little bit better.\u201d\n\nAfter her time in the COVID unit, Tomasetti was ready for her next adventure. This month, she relocated to start a job as certified registered nurse anesthetist at Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia. The inner-city hospital is known for its Level I Regional Resource Trauma Center, which includes major traumatic injuries such as car crashes and gunshot wounds, and a Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, which caters to infants weighing less than 2.5 pounds or born at fewer than 30 weeks. Both require the kind of skilled and advanced-practice nursing Tomasetti is equipped to perform.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m drawn to care for the under-served or the most vulnerable patients,\u201d Tomasetti said. \u201cThey need the best care, and I know I\u2019m qualified to do it. If I can help, why not?\u201d"}}
