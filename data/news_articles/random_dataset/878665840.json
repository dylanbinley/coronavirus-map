The Air Force said such tests \u201care not a response or reaction to world events or regional tensions.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea disagrees.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe U.S. launch of the intercontinental ballistic missile was clearly aimed to pressure us,\u201d North Korea\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry said Thursday. The North could respond, it added, but said \u201cwe believe it is too early and not necessary to do so.\u201d\n\nFILE - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attends the testing of a super-large multiple rocket launcher in North Korea, in this undated photo released Sept. 10, 2019 by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un in April 2018 announced he was stopping ICBM and nuclear tests. The announcement came amid renewed diplomacy with the U.S. and South Korea.\n\n\n\nHowever, North Korean officials have since threatened to resume the tests several times, amid the breakdown in talks.\n\n\"It looks like North Korea is using the U.S. as a pretext for escalating military action, if talks don't work out,\u201d said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a Seoul-based analyst at NK News, a publication that focuses on North Korea affairs.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has played down the North\u2019s missile tests, saying they are not long-range and do not threaten the United States.\n\nThe U.S. has also attempted to put a positive spin on the talks.\n\nAfter North Korea walked away last week, the U.S. State Department characterized the discussions as \u201cgood\u201d and said U.S. negotiators accepted a Swedish invitation to return to the talks in two weeks.\n\nNorth Korea has said such a follow-up meeting is not likely."}}
