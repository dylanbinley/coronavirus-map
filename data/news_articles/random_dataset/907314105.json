The suit names Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg as defendants.\n\nThe suit claims Warren and Buttigieg separately defamed Zimmerman in Twitter statements Feb. 5 recognizing what would have been Trayvon Martin\u2019s 25th birthday. The suit says both did so \u201cfor political gain in misguided and malicious attempts to bolster their standings amongst African-American voters, all at Zimmerman\u2019s expense.\u201d\n\nSen. Warren, D-Mass., has about 3.6 million Twitter followers, and Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has about 1.6 million.\n\nZimmerman is represented by Larry Klayman of Freedom Watch, a Washington organization that frequently files lawsuits on behalf of conservative causes.\n\nIn the court filing, Zimmerman seeks a damages award of $265 million.\n\nFeb. 26 will mark eight years since Martin, 17, was shot and killed.\n\nZimmerman was a volunteer member of a neighborhood watch group in 2012 when he followed Martin, who was visiting family in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Martin noticed Zimmerman and confronted him, and a struggle ensued in which Zimmerman fatally shot the teenager.\n\nAfter being charged with murder, Zimmerman claimed self-defense under Florida\u2019s \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d statute. He was acquitted in a trial in 2013.\n\nOn Feb. 5, Buttigieg tweeted, \u201cTrayvon Martin would have been 25 today. How many 25th birthdays have been stolen from us by white supremacy, gun violence, prejudice, and fear?\u201d\n\nThe same day, Warren tweeted, \u201cMy heart goes out to @SybrinaFulton and Trayvon\u2019s family and friends. He should still be with us today. We need to end gun violence and racism. And we need to build a world where all of our children \u2013 especially young Black boys \u2013 can grow up safe and free.\u201d\n\nSybrina Fulton is Martin\u2019s mother.\n\nThe 30-page lawsuit includes a long summary of the events leading up to the shooting of Martin.\n\nZimmerman filed a lawsuit in Polk County in December against Fulton, family lawyer Benjamin Crump, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the state of Florida and others, seeking $100 million in damages.\n\nFollow reporter Gary White on Twitter: @garywhite13.\n\nTrump commutes Rod Blagojevich sentence:Defiant Blagojevich calls himself a freed 'political prisoner'\n\nWashington:Top Pentagon official who had role in Ukraine aid deal resigns"}}
