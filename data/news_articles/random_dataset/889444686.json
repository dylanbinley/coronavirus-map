Wood, which offers housing for homeless veterans and their families, are veterans, including Cates and Clapper. Carrie Rodriguez/staff photo\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This is the fifth story in the Mirror\u2019s year-long \u201cHumanizing Homelessness\u201d series.\n\nCharles E. Slade doesn\u2019t own much \u2014 but he has a lot of paperwork.\n\nOn a recent Tuesday morning, the 63-year-old sits on a small vinyl couch with several bags of documents at his feet in an office at William J. Wood Veterans House, a housing community for homeless veterans and their families in Federal Way.\n\nAsk him about his accomplishments and hobbies, he pulls out his 1989 patent.\n\n\u201cYou know that light that you have in the back of your vehicle window? I\u2019m the one that came up with the idea \u2014 there it is right there,\u201d he points to his patent that has since expired, which explains how the rear warning lights on a vehicle are activated in response to vehicular speed.\n\nOr he sifts through a binder with dozens of photos he took of his model dollhouses that he worked on for five years that show the various rooms and features, including an intricate Ferris wheel he made out of wood.\n\n\u201cAll this stuff took thousands of hours,\u201d Slade explained.\n\nHis military service? Here\u2019s a copy of his discharge paperwork that states he served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War in 1976-1979.\n\nThere\u2019s also police and court documents about his alleged wrongful arrest. That paperwork doesn\u2019t explain much about how that arrest led to his unfair eviction and subsequent homelessness. But Slade is eager \u2014 and prepared \u2014 to share his story.\n\nFinding camaraderie\n\nAfter the news every night, the name of each person who was killed in Vietnam scrolled across the TV screen.\n\n\u201cI was scared like I don\u2019t know what,\u201d Slade recalled. \u201cShoot, I didn\u2019t want to go in the military. I went because wasn\u2019t nobody coming back from the Vietnam War. So I said, \u2018Shoot, I\u2019d better pick my spot. What hole you want?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Atlanta, Georgia native left his job in textiles making blue jeans and enlisted in the U.S. Army, where he worked in logistics. He said he was in charge of all the narcotics, gold and silver for Fort McPherson, an Army military base in Atlanta, Georgia. He also served at The Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center in Fort Gordon, Georgia.\n\n\u201cI had a good time in the military because it was a sheltered life. It was like living in a gated community.\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t get paid much in the military back then \u2014 but you got perks. There were many places that were isolated just for soldiers \u201cwhere you feel safe because we\u2019re in a gated community,\u201d Slade said, noting he enjoyed the camaraderie of being around other military personnel. They understood doing what is right, and the resulting consequences and discipline when they didn\u2019t get it right, he said.\n\nHis transition from military to civilian life was difficult.\n\n\u201cYou know why it was so hard? Because as a military person, you travel around a lot and people are leeches,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they prey on military people. They take advantage of you.\u201d\n\nHe became addicted to drugs, developed heart problems and had to have three stents placed in his heart.\n\n\u201cI went to treatment, got off drugs, got my heart better and was clean for seven years,\u201d he recalled.\n\nHe began working on a model dollhouse for the National Veterans Creative Arts Competition, and then he moved into a SHAG (Sustainable Housing for Ageless Generations) senior living community in Seattle.\n\nSlade invested three thousand dollars into his model dollhouse and worked on it for three years. Then he discovered that his landlord was allegedly overcharging him for his rent. While Section 8 subsidized part of his rent, his share was $322 per month. However, he ended up paying $493 per month. He said corporate headquarters looked into it and discovered that SHAG owed him $2,000 for the over-payments.\n\nBut he believes his landlord took advantage of him and then evicted him before he had the chance to resolve the financial dispute.\n\nWrongful arrest leads to homelessness\n\n\u201cNext thing I know, I\u2019m in my apartment,\u201d Slade recalled. \u201cThis lady was picking the lock. I walk out of my bedroom and me and her bump into each other.\u201d\n\nHe tussled with the stranger. She tripped in the entryway and fell into the hallway. Slade called the police.\n\n\u201cPolice come. They go into the hallway and I think they are going to arrest her,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, they spoke with his landlord, who allegedly told police they were having problems with him.\n\n\u201cThe police came right back and arrested me. I\u2019m in my apartment, OK. I\u2019m supposed to be in my safest place. But somebody breaks in on me, now I go to jail,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like this. I\u2019m just going to call it like it is. All they seen was a woman crying and a black man standing up. They didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s tail.\u201d\n\nAccording to the police report, the woman told police she had accidentally entered the wrong apartment. However, Slade said his front door was locked and that was not the case.\n\nHe stayed one night in jail and when he got home, there was an eviction notice posted on his door that stated he had three days to vacate his apartment.\n\n\u201cI said what? Wait a minute. What just happened? One minute, I\u2019m in my apartment building all of my models, trying to stay out of trouble \u2026 Then I get evicted? Wait a minute, wait a minute. I had to throw everything I own \u2014 all this \u2014 in the garbage can,\u201d he said, pointing to the binder of his dollhouse models.\n\nAfter his eviction, he left his apartment with only a sleeping bag and some food.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a vet. Never been in trouble in my life. All of a sudden, how I go from being in my apartment to being homeless?\u201d\n\nHe slept at a bus shelter in downtown Seattle for nine months. Then someone told him about William J. Wood Veterans House.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like a little family to me,\u201d Slade said. \u201cSometimes I want to cry because they be looking out for me.\u201d\n\nVeterans helping veterans\n\nAll of the Multi-Service Center employees at William J. Wood Veterans House are veterans.\n\nChris Cates, housing supervisor, served in the Marines as a corporal from 1997-2001.\n\n\u201cI like to work with veterans because you never know what kind of trauma or demons they are carrying,\u201d he said.\n\nCates carries trauma of his own.\n\nDuring his service, he stepped on an improvised explosive device (IED) in the Middle East. His best friend grabbed his arm and said: \u201cEither we\u2019re going to die here together, or we\u2019re going home together,\u2019\u201d he recalled, tearing up. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t have to do that because we were the only two out there. He could\u2019ve walked off without me, but he grabbed my arm and said we\u2019re going home together.\u201d\n\nThe bomb didn\u2019t go off, but guilt has stuck with Cates over the years. He was so distraught after the incident that he left the IED there and forgot to mark it so someone could come and dispose of it.\n\n\u201cOver the years I had this thought: I probably killed another Marine by leaving that bomb there, but could never talk about it because of my guilt. I just worked through this last year.\u201d\n\nWorking with veterans at William J. Wood, Cates thinks about what trauma they have also gone through.\n\n\u201cYeah, we have all our arms and legs, but what kind of trauma happened in there?\u201d\n\nHe also understands the transition from military to civilian life is difficult. When you come home from the military and take off your uniform, it doesn\u2019t feel like home anymore, Cates said.\n\n\u201cI felt more safe in the Middle East than I did home,\u201d he added. \u201cThat felt more like home because I had my Marines with me. I never had a doubt that if something happened, that they would have my back. When you come home, it\u2019s like, OK, I have my family but they\u2019re treating me different, my friends are all off getting married and starting families and I\u2019m over here like, what just happened? It feels really lonely.\u201d\n\nCates, who has a criminal record, struggled as he transitioned back to civilian life.\n\n\u201cIt was just a tough transition for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I do this work. It\u2019s not easy. But part of my personal healing is, I still see this as a way to fight for those guys who are about to come back next.\u201d\n\nAlan Clapper, the lead case manager at William J. Wood, served in the Army as a first class sergeant from 1981-2018. He enjoys when residents share their military experiences with him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a community of veterans and we all share the same kind of background,\u201d Clapper noted. \u201cWe all had order in our life at one time and some of us have lost that, some of us just need a little bit to get it back.\u201d\n\nAs he listens to residents\u2019 stories that led them to homelessness, he understands that most people are not homeless by choice.\n\n\u201cThey have a point in their life they have to make a choice: Pay your rent or fix your car,\u201d Clapper said. \u201cThey fix their car and they lose their house and then they\u2019re homeless. So here I try to have my guys avoid that so we try to set up budgets for them. Rent comes out first \u2014 everything else you can do whatever you want with. That\u2019s what we try to instill in guys here.\u201d\n\nWilliam J. Wood has 44 one, two and three bedroom units that are fully furnished and eligible for rental subsidies through the HUD VASH Program in collaboration with King County Housing Authority. Residents are responsible for paying for 30% of their rent.\n\nClapper said there are a lot of veterans in Federal Way and there is a big need for veterans housing in King County.\n\n\u201cWe deal with people who have high barriers here meaning they have a criminal charge or they have substance abuse or something that keeps them from getting on a lease, like bad credit history,\u201d he noted. \u201cThose are the guys that we want to take in here because we can get them the help. The whole premise of our building is to bring the veterans in and to bring the services in to help them here while they\u2019re housed and not on the street.\u201d\n\nOne of the challenges for residents is that some people victimize and exploit them for their money.\n\n\u201cThe outside world knows these things about veterans: They get a check and they get a lot of free stuff,\u201d Clapper said. \u201cAnd a lot of our veterans, they just want to help somebody \u2014 that\u2019s part of what we do. So it\u2019s hard to see somebody at the bus stop sleeping there. Why don\u2019t you come up to my place and get a shower? And next thing you know, the guy left after a shower and took the guy\u2019s pension for a month. It\u2019s a work in progress.\u201d\n\nDespite the challenges, Clapper said the success stories motivate him.\n\n\u201cOne guy tells me he used to live in a church yard in a tent for a year,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when I see him come here and he gets an apartment and he takes care of it \u2014 that makes me feel better. That\u2019s one guy that I know tomorrow he\u2019s gonna wake up in a nice warm bed, with a roof over his head, he\u2019ll have a meal and we\u2019ve done that. We\u2019ve allowed him to not worry about who\u2019s going to rob him or who\u2019s going to steal from him, because he can lock his door at night.\u201d\n\nFinding a way forward\n\nClapper has been working with Slade for the past year-and-a-half trying to help Slade get his life on track.\n\nSlade reported the police incident that led to his arrest to the Seattle Police Accountability Board. The board on found that the arresting officers did not have on a body camera during Slade\u2019s arrest, so they sent the officers to training on how to do that, according to Jan. 22, 2019 board documents.\n\n\u201cBut his big beef is, how did he get kicked out of his apartment before he came home [from jail]?\u201d Clapper said.\n\nClapper sends Slade on \u201cmissions,\u201d including to classes to get educated on renter\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cNever has anybody told him that they\u2019ve ever heard of a three-day eviction,\u201d he said of Slade. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he was in the wrong. I believe he was unduly arrested and put out of his place the next day before he even got out of jail.\u201d\n\nClapper said they are trying to find a pro bono lawyer to look at Slade\u2019s case regarding his unfair eviction.\n\n\u201cHe really just wants an answer. Do I have a case? Or do I just put this behind me?\u201d Clapper said.\n\nAs Slade continues to seek justice, he is also working on his sanity, he said. He would also like to one-day return to making more dollhouses.\n\n\u201cBefore, I had a passion. I spent a lot of money and a lot of time making these dollhouses,\u201d Slade said. \u201cAnd then they took what I love away \u2026 I\u2019m mad as I don\u2019t know what. Everybody want closure. They want the right thing done. But I have no justice.\u201d\n\nSlade said he does have William J. Wood Veterans House, and employees like Clapper who are helping him to move forward.\n\n\u201cSometimes, [Clapper] come in here at 4:30 in the morning and he don\u2019t have to be here until 7,\u201d Slade said. \u201cSometimes he comes and checks on everybody. I feel safe in this building. I have some beautiful people here and if it weren\u2019t for these beautiful people, I\u2019d probably be somewhere I wouldn\u2019t be proud of.\u201d\n\nMore information\n\nWilliam J.
