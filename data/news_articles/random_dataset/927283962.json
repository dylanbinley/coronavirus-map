This protest in Paris was for Adama Traor\u00e9, a black 23 year old boy whose death was covered up by the French police. Although today was mainly #justicepouradama, ALL black lives and police brutality were considered. #blacklivesmatter pic.twitter.com/3fkufemgOf \u2014 Beatrice (@bealligerent) June 2, 2020\n\nSocial unrest is breaking out in Paris this evening, with police bombarding Black Lives Matter protesters with tear gas. As shown with the Gilets Jaunes, the Macron government has an appalling record on human rights. pic.twitter.com/ZPVSbeDPRm \u2014 Richard Wellings (@RichardWellings) June 2, 2020"}}
