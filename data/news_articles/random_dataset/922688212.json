His last announcing job was at Fort Erie in Canada from 2011-'14.\n\nDimoff's primary job is being a registered nurse in the pediatric critical care unit of a hospital in Scottsdale, Ariz. His summer plan is to continue working there while calling races at Ruidoso \u2013 quite a commute.\n\nThe meet opens May 22 with four consecutive days of racing, culminating with the May 25 Memorial Day program and runs through Labor Day, Sept. 7. The closing day feature is the All American Futurity, signature race of the Ruidoso Downs meet.\n\nThe track is operating under strict protocols due to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nNew to the Paulick Report?
