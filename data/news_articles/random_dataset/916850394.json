For companies that do not hold procurement licences, the submissions should include the name of the supplier of the fuel to be traded in foreign currency. Petroleum companies are advised to make submissions before end of day on Tuesday 3 march 2020.\u201d\n\nQuestions have already been raised as to why Zuva Petroleum has more than two sites in Harare selling in forex while other dealers have been restricted to only two sites.\n\nZera was not available for comment as its acting chief executive Eddington Mazambani did not respond to questions sent via email and WhatsApp."}}
