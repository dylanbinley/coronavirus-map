Nobody is sacred. Even a powerful and influential corporation must follow the law,\u201d Calida said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nMalaca\u00f1ang also backed the solicitor general and denied that Calida put pressure against the NTC to shut down ABS-CBN.\n\nAfter the NTC issued the closure order and ABS-CBN decided to shut down early, key words and hashtags relating to the network\u2019s signing off dominated the Philippines Trends of Twitter.\n\nThe following hashtags concerning the calls to protect press freedom are #NoToABSCBNShutDown, #DefendPressFreedom, #IStandWithABSCBN and #MalayangPamamahayag,\n\nNames of \u201cABS-CBN\u201d and its popular programs \u201cShowtime,\u201d \u201cProbinsyan\u201d and \u201cWalang Hanggan\u201d also made it there as Filipino fans expressed their sadness over the shutdown.\n\nThe solicitor general\u2019s word\n\nCalida\u2019s name was not initially involved in ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise renewal woes.\n\nABS-CBN\u2019s current franchise was granted by the Republic Act 7966 signed into law on March 30, 1995, wherein its radio and television were authorized to run for 25 years until May 4.\n\nTo extend its operations for another 25 years, five bills have been filed and are still pending in the 18th Congress.\n\nIn 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte expressed his intent to close down ABS-CBN over accusations that it did not air his advertisements during the 2016 national elections.\n\nDuterte renewed his threat again last December 4, calling out the Lopez family, the network\u2019s owners, in his outburst against \u201coligarchs.\u201d\n\nHe also alleged that ABS-CBN News was too critical in its reports on his administration and policies.\n\nWhile the lower House have yet to act on the bills, Calida suddenly filed the quo warranto petition last February 10 to revoke the network\u2019s franchise due to alleged violations. This was the same legal remedy used to oust former Maria Lourdes Sereno in 2018.\n\nIn a race against time to renew the franchise and end the tension with Duterte, Carlo Katigbak, ABS-CBN president and chief executive officer, apologized to Duterte during a Senate inquiry into the company\u2019s renewal of operations last February 24.\n\nDespite Duterte accepting the apology, the passage of the renewal bills remained uncertain.\n\nCalida also did not withdraw the petition to revoke the media firm\u2019s license.\n\nThe lower House, meanwhile, only managed to deliberate on the bills, last March 10, amid the public clamor.\n\nSince no renewal bills were passed before the 18th Congress went on break, House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano and Rep. Franz Alvarez (Palawan) asked the NTC to grant ABS-CBN a provisional authority to operate after the franchise lapsed.\n\nThe Senate then also approved a resolution with the same appeal, which was then approved by Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra.\n\nLast March, NTC Commissioner Gamaliel Cordoba promised to the House legislative panel that it will heed Guevarra\u2019s advice on giving ABS-CBN provisional authority to run while the bills to renew its license are still pending.\n\nHowever, after Calida\u2019s warning against NTC of possible graft charges, the commission changed tune and issued the order for the broadcaster\u2019s closure.\n\nCalida\u2019s role as solicitor general\n\nUnder its mandate and functions also posted on its website, the Office of the Solicitor General \u201crepresents the Government of the Philippines, its agencies and instrumentalities and its officials and agents in any litigation, proceeding, investigation or matter requiring the services of lawyers.\u201d\n\nThe OSG is an independent and autonomous office attached to the DOJ. However, even if it is attached to the DOJ, the OSG \u201cis not a constituent unit of the DOJ.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s authority, control and supervision over the OSG are limited only to budgetary purposes.\n\nThe mandate and function also indicated that the OSG shall represent government owned nad controlled corpoerations when it is authorized by the chief executive of the head of the office concerned.\n\n\u201cThe Office of the Solicitor General shall discharge duties requiring the services of lawyers,\u201d the mandate and functions read.\n\nCalida also has the special powers to \u201crepresent the government in the high court and the Court of Appeals in all criminal proceedings.\u201d\n\nHe is also authorized to do the following, among other functions:\n\nInvestigate, initiate court action, or in any manner proceed against any person, corporation or firm for the enforcement of any contract, bond, guarantee, mortgage, pledge or other collateral executed in favor of the Government. Where proceedings are to be conducted outside of the Philippines the Solicitor General may employ counsel to assist in the discharge of the aforementioned responsibilities.\n\nAppear in any court in any action involving the validity of any treaty, law, executive order\n\nNTC grants provisional authority to other companies before\n\nDespite the lower chamber\u2019s failure to prioritize the renewal bills for ABS-CBN, several members of the Congress immediately denounced the NTC over the issuance of the cease-and-desist order against media giant.\n\nSen. Kiko Pangilinan and Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri argued that NTC have issued provisional authority to other broadcasting companies before while waiting for Congress\u2019 approval of their franchises.\n\n\u201cThe NTC action is highly irregular as it has issued hundreds of provisional authorities to other broadcasting companies pending the approval by Congress of their franchise. Singling out ABS-CBN is grave abuse of discretion,\u201d Pangilinan said in a statement.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon likewise said that NTC can legally grant a provisional authority.\n\nSenators Risa Hontiveros and Sonny Angara also denounced the move noting that it was made in the middle of the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cGiven the circumstances, this cease-and-desist order by the NTC is ill-timed and insensitive to the needs of the public. The delivery of timely and correct information is essential to our COVID-19 response,\u201d Hontiveros said.\n\n\u201cProbably not a good move to shut down a prime source of reliable information when our people need it most. In the middle of a pandemic and a recession. Grabe ito,\u201d Angara said.\n\nAlvarez, meanwhile, blamed Calida for the ABS-CBN shutdown, noting that only Congress has the power over legislative broadcasting franchises.\n\n\u201cA legislative franchise is a law and by deciding whether to grant or deny a franchise, it is passing a law and making policy. The Solicitor General should have the decency to give Congress this courtesy to complete the exercise of its power,\u201d he said."}}
