Most will be slightly higher. Terrain dictates that height. Most of the work will be done in the right of way. Some of this work will be done adjacent to the existing lines because there\u2019s no flexibility on outages.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to, in some cases, take out the line and build right on top of it. So, the line has to remain active. Then we build the line next to it and then throw the switch at some point when that line is complete.\u201d\n\nReactions from leaders\n\nRidgeway Mayor Craig O\u2019Der said the project is \u201csomewhat of a concern.\n\n\u201cThey [AEP] came through Ridgeway and put new poles in [before this project], but they didn\u2019t take out the old poles. We\u2019ve been waiting 18 months. People have asked when the old poles are going to be removed, but other companies, like Comcast, are still using them.\u201d\n\nBuchanan said she always has encouraged residents to go to public meetings with their questions.\n\n\u201cBut it sounds to me like they are upgrading a power line, and that\u2019s a good thing, particularly for economic development,\u201d she said, after learning more of the project."}}
