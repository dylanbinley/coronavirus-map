El Trumpito\u2019s hard-on to stick it to China for \u201c ruining\u201d you know what let\u2019s be honest, exposing how inept of a leader he is decided to ban all transactions from both TikTok and WeChat in 45 days. Under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act, the EO (executive order) states:\n\n\u201cThe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2026continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. At this time, action must be taken to address the threat posed by one mobile application, in particular, TikTok.\u201d\n\nWeChat\u2019s banning won\u2019t really affect Americans. BUT its parent company, Tencent, does have a lot of investments in American companies such as Snapchat\u2019s parent company. Tencent also owns Riot Games, the studio behind the insanely popular MOBA game, League of Legends, and Valorant.\n\nThe company also owns a significant portion of Epic Games best known for the highly-addictive battle royale shooter Fortnite. Tencent also operates the video game PUBG (PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds).\n\nTencent came under intense scrutiny last year because of its ownership stake in Activision Blizzard, which banned a HearthStone eSports player for his stance on supporting the Hong Kong protests. In a tweet explaining the executive order that will potentially ban Tencent, LA Times\u2019 tech reporter, Sam Dean, reported that the video game companies owned by Tencent \u201cwill not be affected.\u201d But he did point out just how \u201cWILD\u201d this ban will be if it goes down.\n\nThis was pretty much impossible to tell from the EO itself\u2014I also had a \ud83d\ude32 moment that they were roping in Riot et al when I first read it\u2014but \"we just mean WeChat\" is the WH line for tonight. But banning all transactions on/with WeChat alone is still WILD. \u2014 Sam Dean \ud83e\udd85 (@SamAugustDean) August 7, 2020\n\nTikTok will suffer the most if Microsoft, which is ByteDance\u2019s last hope, cannot reach a deal in the 45 days. The app has 80 million American active monthly users who could be affected. The Chinese-based company is arguing that it made all the necessary moves to distance itself from China to avoid this mess. Still, Trump and the US Government are very adamant about banning the popular video-sharing app.\n\nBoth TikTok and WeChat users have 45 days keep using the app, Instagram\u2019s TikTok rival, Reels, is looking really attractive right about now.\n\n\u2014\n\nPhoto: NurPhoto / Getty\n\nBlank Stare: Donald Trump Issues Executive Order Banning TikTok & WeChat \u201cTransactions\u201d In 45 Days was originally published on hiphopwired.com\n\nAlso On The Urban Daily:"}}
