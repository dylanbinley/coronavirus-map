It also, crucially, reiterated that there\u2019s \u201cno evidence of wrongdoing\u201d by the Bidens, and that Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry over the pressure he put on the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens and the withholding of foreign aid as leverage, which are possible abuses of power.\n\nThe article\u2019s headline, however, painted a different picture, reading \u201cUkraine to Review Criminal Case on Owner of Firm Linked to Biden\u2019s Son.\u201d When detached from Trump\u2019s push for a frivolous investigation, this headline, which was later slightly altered, hints that there\u2019s reason to suspect the Bidens of wrongdoing. (This likely isn\u2019t Kramer\u2019s fault; reporters rarely write their own headlines.)\n\nx (x)\n\nx (x)"}}
