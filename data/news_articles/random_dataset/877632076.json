Here he is, he had just had a confrontation at the front of his house.\n\n\u201cCouple hours later, someone is banging on his back door, and it\u2019s a fenced yard.\n\n\u201cAnd then someone jumps out of the bushes.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really say anything against Mr Dennis for doing what he did.\n\n\u201cI think it was just a horrible accident, that should never have happened.\u201d\n\nMr Bergan\u2019s friend who had driven him from the airport also witnessed the incident.\n\n\u201cThey were working on him when our officers got there, and our officers got there pretty quick,\u201d Mr Johnson said.\n\nMr Bergan had previously lived in Florida before returning to Norway, where he lived with Mr Dennis\u2019s daughter and their young son.\n\nmedia_camera Chris Bergan was killed at his father-in-law\u2019s home after a birthday surprise went tragically wrong.\n\nmedia_camera The property where Chris Bergan was shot dead. Picture: Google Maps.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference on Thursday, the sheriff told reporters that Mr Dennis will not be charged over the incident.\n\n\u201cOur investigation has revealed that this was totally accidental, it was a really sad occurrence, and that no charges are warranted in this case,\u201d Mr Johnson said.\n\nAmber Roland, a lawyer with the State Attorney\u2019s Office, said authorities had examined the scene of the tragedy.\n\n\u201cWe were able to view the evidence,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe were present on scene when detectives interviewed the witnesses.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s consistent.\n\n\u201cWe determined that [this was a] tragic accident.\u201d\n\nAfter the shots were fired, Mr Dennis immediately called emergency services and started first aid, Mr Johnson said. According to the sheriff, when deputies arrived on the scene, there were towels on Mr Bergan and attempts had been made to stop the bleeding.\n\nmedia_camera Chris Bergan with his wife and their son. media_camera Richard Dennis shot his son-in-law in a case of mistaken identity, according to police.\n\n500 ACCIDENTAL KILLINGS A YEAR\n\nThe availability of guns has long been a hotly debate topic in American politics, more so since the rise of mass shootings, many of them targeting schools, in recent years.\n\nEvery year, an average of 36,383 Americans \u2014 100 per day \u2014 are killed with guns, with around 500 of those accidental killings, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nAround a fifth of the 100,000 non-fatal shootings each year are unintentional.\n\nSome of Mr Bergan\u2019s friends raised the issue while paying tribute to him on Facebook.\n\nOne person wrote: \u201cMy childhood buddy, Chris Bergan, was killed accidentally by a family member.\n\n\u201cHe had no idea he was shooting his son-in-law,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced gun culture has everything to do with this tragedy.\n\n\u201cPlease think about the way you talk about guns and consider dropping the gun pride.\n\n\u201cTeach your kids they are tools not toys.\u201d\n\nmegan.palin@news.com.au | @Megan_Palin\n\nOriginally published as Birthday surprise goes horribly wrong"}}
