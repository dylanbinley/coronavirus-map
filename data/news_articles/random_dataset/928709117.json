It was then set on fire and rolled into a lake in the park, NBC 12 reported.\n\nThere was no police presence in the park, but a police helicopter was seen circling the area after the city-owned figure was torn down, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.\n\nThe city\u2019s parks department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the fallen statue from The Associated Press.\n\nEarlier during the day, Activist Chelsea Higgs-Wise and other protesters spoke to a crowd gathered at Byrd Park about the struggles of indigenous people and African-Americans in America. \u201cWe have to start where it all began,\u201d Higgs-Wise said during her speech. \u201cWe have to start with the people who stood first on this land.\u201d\n\nThe Columbus statue was dedicated in Richmond in December 1927, and had been the first statue of Christopher Columbus erected in the South, the newspaper reported. Its toppling comes amid national protests over the death of George Floyd and several days after a statue of Confederate Gen. Williams Carter Wickham was pulled from its pedestal in Monroe Park by demonstrators who also used ropes to tear it down.\n\nSeparately, a statue of Christopher Columbus in Boston was beheaded, police said Wednesday.\n\nThe statue \u2014 which stands on a plinth in the heart of Boston \u2014 has been controversial for years, like other Columbus statues across the US, and has been vandalized in the past.\n\nBoston police were alerted to the damage shortly after midnight on Tuesday, a spokesman told AFP. An investigation is under way but no one has been arrested, he added.\n\nA jogger running past the statue Wednesday said she approved of the decapitation.\n\n\u201cComing out of the Black Lives Matter protests, I think it\u2019s a good thing to capitalize on this momentum,\u201d she told AFP, without giving her name.\n\n\u201cJust like black people in this country, indigenous people have also been wronged. I think this movement is pretty powerful and this is very symbolic,\u201d she added.\n\nDozens of American cities have over the years replaced \u201cColumbus Day\u201d in October \u2014 which became a federal holiday in 1937 \u2014 with a day of tribute to \u201cindigenous peoples.\u201d\n\nBut not Boston or New York, which have large Italian-origin communities.\n\nBoston\u2019s mayor, Marty Walsh, condemned the beheading but added that the statue would be removed on Wednesday pending a decision about its future, local media reported.\n\nIn Minnesota, a rope was thrown around the 10-foot bronze statue Wednesday afternoon and protesters pulled it off its stone pedestal.\n\nBREAKING: Protesters have toppled the Christopher Columbus statue at the Minnesota State Capitol. @WCCO pic.twitter.com/uCpZY1zoA8 \u2014 Nick Streiff (@nickstreiff) June 10, 2020\n\nThe protesters, including Dakota and Ojibwe Indians, said they consider Columbus as a symbol of genocide against Native Americans. They said they had tried many times to remove it through the political process, but without success.\n\nState Patrol troopers in helmets, who provide security in the Capitol complex, stood by at a distance but did not try to stop the protesters, who celebrated afterward with Native American singing and drumming.\n\nThe troopers eventually formed a line to protect the toppled statue so it could be taken away."}}
