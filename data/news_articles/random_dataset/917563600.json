The thoughts of all Greeks are with you in this struggle that we will win together,\" he said in a statement broadcast on Greek state television ERT.\n\n\"It is time to do what is necessary to ensure that, when the crisis has abated, the (European) Union will have risen to the unique circumstances so that we can emerge united and stronger from the crisis. This means leaving no one behind. No state, no citizen,\" he stressed.\n\n\"Our sorrow is deep as more than 15,000 of my compatriots have lost their lives as a consequence of this virus, particularly old people. But Spain does not lose hope. Also, more than 50,000 people have already recovered from the disease, the highest number in the world after China,\" Spain's Ambassador to Greece Enrique Viguera said.\n\n\"Let me also thank the many women and men of this country, including the president of the Republic, who have found the time to share with us, in such difficult circumstances, their messages of grief and solidarity,\" he said.\n\n\"With solidarity and strength we shall overcome this together,\" Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou tweeted in Spanish and in Greek.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Greek officials have also sent similar messages to Italy, France and other countries.\n\nUnity and solidarity are the only way to overcome the pandemic's economic repercussions, according to Greek Finance Minister Christos Staikouras.\n\nRecalling a financial package worth half a trillion euros adopted by the European Union (EU) member states' finance ministers on Thursday to combat the economic fallout from the pandemic, Staikouras said in a statement broadcast on ERT that \"(Thursday's) positive decision should be the starting point of even more ambitious European initiatives in the future to deal with the effects of the coronavirus without complacency, but also with focus on the (European) economy's return to normality.\"\n\nAlso on Friday, the Greek Health Ministry announced that 56 new coronavirus cases and four deaths have been confirmed in the last 24 hours.\n\nGreece has been in lockdown since March 23.
