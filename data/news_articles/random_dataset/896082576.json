The documents said: \u201cWe want to present a dynamic vision of devolved Scotland to an international audience.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we want our domestic audience to see that the Executive is making a contribution to debates on key global issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe might want to make the case that it is only because Scotland is part of the Union that we have this opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe document also show fears the summit would be viewed as a \u201cpoisoned chalice\u201d and used by opponents of the Executive to make political gains.\n\nA major UN climate change summit will take place in Glasgow this year.\n\nAbout 30,000 delegates are expected to attend the 26th Conference of the Parties, known as COP26, at the Scottish Events Campus."}}
