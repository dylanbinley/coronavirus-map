This allows health care professionals to safely reuse the N95 masks underneath during the national mask shortage.\n\nAmong the many volunteers is Hope Baxter of Papillion. She decided to create masks after her two sisters \u2014 who are nurses in nursing homes \u2014 expressed the need. Since Baxter runs her own craft business, Hope Creations, she already had supplies on hand and knew how to sew.\n\nFor beginner sewers interested in helping, Baxter recommends using online patterns. They should take it slow at first, she said, until getting the hang of it.\n\n\u201cTry to master your first one,\u201d Baxter said. \u201cOnce the first mask is done, it\u2019s easy to just keep cranking them out.\u201d\n\nLifelong sewer Becky Rasmussen of Bellevue, who\u2019s participating in the Million Mask Challenge, said she\u2019s learned that mass quantities in an assembly line-type fashion is the most efficient way to quickly turn out items in bulk."}}
