That's not a good sign for re-opening the U.S. economy.", "TEXT": "It\u2019s a glaring problem even as President Trump assembled a task focused on reopening the economy as soon as possible.\n\nNearly every day for the past two weeks, 120,000 to 140,000 tests have been administered, according to a tracker assembled by volunteer journalists and scientists.\n\nNearly 3 million Americans \u2014 less than 1 percent of the population \u2014 have been screened for the virus. That leaves the United States still behind South Korea, Germany, Canada and Italy on testing per capita.\n\nCommercial labs, including the two largest companies Quest and LabCorp, analyzed 30 percent fewer coronavirus tests over the past week, Politico's David Lim reports. Some of these commercial labs, which conduct about two-thirds of the coronavirus testing in the U.S., are sitting with unused testing equipment awaiting more samples, he writes.\n\nAnalysts say the country must continue to ramp up testing, not ease off the gas pedal.\n\nThe United States must perform 1 million tests per day to reach levels similar to South Korea, a country that has become a global example for how to contain the virus\u2019s spread, estimates Matthew Harrison, a biotech analyst for Morgan Stanley.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo screen the United States' entire population of 330 million, capacity would need to reach 22 million tests per day, according to economist Paul Romer, a Nobel laureate.\n\nIrwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, told me the United States should be testing between 750,000 and 1 million people a week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not even close to that,\u201d Redlener said. \u201cWithout having a lot more capacity to do rapid testing, it\u2019s not easy to see how we\u2019re going to start going back to work.\u201d\n\nTrump's top advisers are acknowledging the serious testing shortcomings.\n\n\u201cWe have to have something in place that is efficient and that we can rely on, and we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Associated Press when asked about the country\u2019s testing and tracing capacity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat's despite Trump's own confidence in the pace of testing in the U.S. and insistence the country doesn't need a widespread program.\n\nThe Washington Post's Aaron Blake:\n\nSome perspective: States still have imposed strict guidelines about who should \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t \u2014 get tested.\n\nVirginia lays out four tiers of priority for who should get tested by the state\u2019s public labs \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t include most individuals, even if they\u2019re experiencing flu-like symptoms.\n\nIn the first tier are front-line responders with fever or signs of a respiratory illness. The second tier includes clusters of people \u2014 such as in a medical facility \u2014 with an unknown respiratory illness. Hospitalized individuals with symptoms are in the third tier, and the fourth tier is people with symptoms who live or work in group settings such as jails or homeless shelters. People who meet those criteria can visit some 60 testing sites around the state, but they must first obtain a doctor\u2019s note and make an appointment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe guidance is \u201csensitive to the capacity of our state labs,\u201d Mike Keatts, regional emergency coordinator in the Virginia Department of Health\u2019s Office of Emergency Preparedness, told me.\n\nKeatts said the labs are now able to turn around test results within a day, after experiencing an initial backlog in early April. He added that the state is now considering whether to revise the testing criteria so that it expands testing to underserved populations. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also considering revising its similarly narrow guidelines for who should get tested.\n\nThe federal government and states have been publicly feuding over acquiring the tests.\n\nThe issue is particularly muddled given a chaotic administration response and a complex U.S. health-care system, in which public and private efforts often proceed along separate tracks with little coordination.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis quibbling between the states and the federal government is kind of shocking,\u201d Redlener said.\n\nThe administration said last week it wants states to take control of drive-through testing sites, which are currently run by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But state governors, who have been scrambling to purchase testing supplies, are frustrated that FEMA hasn\u2019t done more to centralize and streamline the acquisition process.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said yesterday that FEMA should take over purchasing the testing equipment and allocating it to avoid a \u201cbidding war\u201d among states competing for supplies. The same day, New York City leaders announced the city will start manufacturing its own test kits and has locked down enough supplies for 100,000 tests per week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEverybody is going to those companies to buy the tests,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to the heads of several companies myself and they have a limited production. \u2026 I would say to the federal government, \u2018You take that piece, don\u2019t replicate the 50-state pandemonium.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPromises from private companies to step up large-scale testing are being carried out slowly \u2013 if at all.\n\nLast month, Trump highlighted vows from private companies including Walmart, Target, CVS and Rite Aid. But here's the reality:\n\nWalmart has opened four testing sites so far. A spokesman for the company has opened four testing sites so far. A spokesman for the company told Business Insider it plans to have more than 20 testing sites operating in at least 10 states by the month\u2019s end.\n\nRite Aid has opened just two testing sites, one in Philadelphia and the other in Harrisburg, Pa. The company says it\u2019s planning to open more sites in six more states in the coming weeks.\n\nTarget hasn\u2019t opened any testing sites, a spokesman hasn\u2019t opened any testing sites, a spokesman told NPR.\n\n\u201cAt this time, federal, state and local officials continue to lead the planning for additional testing sites,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cWe stand committed to offering our parking lot locations and supporting their efforts when they are ready to activate.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEpidemiologist Abdul El-Sayed:\n\nAhh, oof and ouch\n\nAHH: A team of government officials have a plan to reopen parts of the country.\n\nOfficials from FEMA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have come up with a strategy, obtained by our Post colleagues Lena H. Sun, Josh Dawsey and William Wan, to guide state and local governments on how they can ease restrictions to help people get back to work and out of their homes. The agencies created a 36-page document that has been discussed at the White House.\n\nAD\n\nTrump wants a final plan ready within days so he can make suggestions to some states to reopen on May 1. The version obtained by the Post is \u201cearly draft by FEMA and contains granular instructions for a phased reopening of institutions such as schools, child-care facilities, summer camps, parks, faith-based organizations and restaurants,\u201d our colleagues report.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTrump said he planned to speak with all 50 governors \u2018very shortly\u2019 and would then begin authorizing individual governors to implement \u2018a very powerful reopening plan\u2019 at a specific time and date for each state,\u201d Lena, Josh and William write. \u201cHe said roughly 20 states have avoided the crippling outbreaks that have affected others, and he hinted that some could begin restarting their economies even before May 1.\u201d\n\nOOF: Reopening the economy won\u2019t mean returning to normal.\n\nAt least at first, reopening the economy may mean uneasy workers donning masks and working staggered or fewer shifts. It can happen in waves, with some industries, such as construction and manufacturing, able to restart sooner than those that require more human contact, such as live music and restaurants.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBusinesses can\u2019t just rehire everyone they laid off and return to 100 percent,\u201d our Post colleague Heather Long reports. \u201cIt\u2019s more akin to a rehabilitation process where business begins somewhere around 50 percent, economists say. From there, it depends on safety and customer demand.\u201d\n\nThe revival will also depend on how safe people feel. Widespread testing or a vaccine will be key to getting things back to normal levels, economists warn. In the meantime, there could also be a staggering of when people venture out of their homes, with older and more vulnerable people staying home longer until they feel assured it\u2019s safe to be out.\n\nExpect a transition period. Heather points to the Port of Los Angeles as a signal of what\u2019s to come: Some workers have returned. Some have seen lowered paychecks. Routines are not the same. The port\u2019s officials think it\u2019ll be a year before volumes return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nOUCH: Our new reality could continue, in some ways, into 2022.\n\nThat\u2019s according to new research out of Harvard University\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health that suggests some intermittent periods of social distancing may need to continue until then to prevent an onslaught of coronavirus cases from overwhelming the health system.\n\nAD\n\nThe researchers, while acknowledging the profound economic fallout, say it\u2019s not likely life will return to normal anytime soon, Stat News\u2019s Helen Branswell reports.\n\n\u201cOur goal in modeling such policies is not to endorse them but to identify likely trajectories of the epidemic under alternative approaches,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cWe do not take a position on the advisability of these scenarios given the economic burden that sustained distancing may impose, but we note the potentially catastrophic burden on the healthcare system that is predicted if distancing is poorly effective and-or not sustained for long enough.\u201d\n\nMost people insist they wouldn\u2019t return to their normal pre-coronavirus routines immediately even if states soon suspended stay-at-home orders. According to a new Gallup poll, just over 7 in 10 Americans said they would \u201cwait to see what happens\u201d with the virus, and another 10 percent said they would limit contact \u201cindefinitely.\u201d Only 20 percent said they would \u201cimmediately\u201d return to their normal activities.\n\nWhite House coronavirus response\n\nTrump is halting payments to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe president announced his administration will suspend funds for the United Nations agency until its handling of the pandemic is reviewed.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s announcement was expected, as he seeks to deflect blame for his early dismissal of the virus as a threat to Americans and the U.S. economy,\u201d our Post colleague Anne Gearan reports. \u201cIt is not yet clear how the United States will cut off money to the main international organization focused on fighting the pandemic, or whether Trump is setting conditions for a resumption of U.S. payments.\u201d\n\nTrump said U.S. funding to WHO would be suspended for a period of 60 to 90 days.\n\nAnne adds: \u201cConservative allies of the president have begun focusing on the WHO as complicit in a Chinese coverup of the outbreak in late 2019 and early 2020, before Trump moved to respond. The finger-pointing allows Trump to deflect blame from his own initial reaction to the outbreak as of no consequence to the United States. Trump also resents the WHO for opposing his decision, in late January, to block most air travel from China.\u201d\n\nTrump said the funding halt will continue \u201cwhile a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization\u2019s role and severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\u201d He added: \u201cThe outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death, very little death, and certainly very little death by comparison. This would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage.\u201d\n\nTrump met with recovered covid-19 patients.\n\nTrump and Vice President Pence held a White House roundtable with patients from California, Michigan and Arkansas who had recovered after battling through covid-19. They talked about their experiences in quarantine and some patients said it was the worst they\u2019ve ever felt.\n\nTrump repeatedly questioned them about hydroxychloroquine, the treatment he has frequently touted. Hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug, has been used by hospitals to treat the most ill coronavirus patients, but can also cause serious side effects.\n\n\u201cWhat have you got to lose?\u201d Trump asked at the meeting.\n\nFrom the New York Times's Annie Karni:\n\nMichigan state Rep. Karen Whitsett (D) praised Trump, crediting the treatment with her recovery from the disease. \u201cIt is such an honor to be here, and such an honor to be here amongst all you survivors. I just can't say how wonderful it is to see your faces. Thank you for everything you have done,\u201d Whitsett said. \u201cI did not know that saying thank you had a political line. I didn't know that. I thought just saying thank you meant thank you.\u201d\n\nTrump asked each person at the meeting about their symptoms. He asked if they thought they would die. He asked them to describe how it felt to be short of breath.\n\nWhen he asked one participant, Rachel Mangan of Arkansas, if she felt 100 percent better now, Mangan replied: \u201c85 percent.\u201d Trump joked: \u201cStay away. \u2026 Keep her away.\u201d\n\nWhitsett undermined Trump\u2019s claims that hospitals are doing fine.\n\nThe Democratic state lawmaker contradicted the administration\u2019s assurances about treatment at hospitals. Trump and Pence dismissed the idea this week that people are being turned away at hospitals.\n\nWhitsett said she\u2019s \u201clost several family members to covid \u2014 all in one household \u2026 My cousin, Cheryl Fowler, was in ICU. She lost her husband. He was turned away from numerous hospitals, as was she \u2014 over four times. And within six hours, she lost her father-in-law, who was turned away numerous times.\u201d\n\nThe campaign continues\n\nBarack Obama breaks his neutrality, endorsing Joe Biden.\n\nFormer president Barack Obama threw his support behind his former vice president, saying the presumptive presidential nominee \u201chas the character and the experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery.\u201d\n\nHis endorsement came one day after Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) endorsed his former rival after he left Biden as the last Democratic candidate standing.\n\nA 12-minute video \u201cmarked the 44th president\u2019s most detailed comments this year on the upcoming election,\u201d our Post colleagues Sean Sullivan and Michael Scherer report. \u201cHe tied his support of Biden to the coronavirus pandemic, issued a blistering critique of the Republican Party and sought to hit unifying notes by nodding to the rivals Biden vanquished in the primary, which he said featured \u2018one of the most impressive Democratic fields ever.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn the address, Obama said \u201ceven before the pandemic turned the world upside down, it was already clear we needed real structural change.\u201d\n\nCoronavirus latest\n\nHere are other headlines and developments to catch up on this morning.\n\nGood to know:\n\nCheck your bank accounts for a $1,200 deposit.
