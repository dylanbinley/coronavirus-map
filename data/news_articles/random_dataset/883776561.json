Jean Hunhoff, R-Yankton. \u201cI don\u2019t think the South Dakota citizen deserves that. I think if someone has a mental health crisis, they should be able to access that.\u201d\n\nFormer HSC administrator Ken Cole left in May after just a year of heading up operations at the hospital. When he started in May, 2018, Cole was the fourth person in two years to head up operations at the hospital.\n\nAs of September, a number of units at the Yankton hospital were still going unused by the state due to lack of staffing.\n\nInvestigators with the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services described an atmosphere of overwhelming stress and desperation for workers in their 2018 report, while also outlining the hospital\u2019s deadly missteps in the hours and moments leading to White\u2019s death.\n\nA nurse told federal investigators staffing the morning of White\u2019s death was \u201chorrible,\u201d according to the report. Another said they felt \u201cstretched\u201d and \u201ctraumatized.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeveral staff broke down and started to cry during the debriefing, because the staff were so busy,\u201d according to the report.\n\nAnne White called emergency responders for help in the winter of 2017 because she was suicidal. She was brought by police a day later to the Human Services Center and admitted at 1:16 p.m. Dec. 19, 2017.\n\nShe was pronounced dead less than a day later.\n\nIn the intervening hours, nurses and other hospital staff failed to monitor her health appropriately, according to the feds, and did not follow the hospital\u2019s policy of transferring patients who were going through the dangerous and life-threatening process of withdrawal. White asked directly to be moved.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m withdrawing, why aren\u2019t you doing something about my blood pressure?\u201d White asked a nurse, according to the report.\n\n\u201cI think I need to go to an ER,\u201d she said. \u201cI am in withdrawals.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials determined the hospital had fixed problems leading to White\u2019s death in April of 2018, though workforce problems continued.\n\nIn the year that followed White\u2019s death, staffing problems continued and South Dakota legislators declared mental health issues in the state to be a \u201cpublic health crisis.\u201d\n\nDespite that declaration and findings by feds that staffing patterns at HSC created a \u201cpotential safety risk for all patients,\u201d there are no clear plans by state officials to pay for additional staff to help alleviate those who are already so busy treating patients in crisis.\n\nInstead, lawmakers want to shift more responsibility to the private sector and community-based care services. The state Legislature formed three interim session committees to come up with ideas for prevention and treatment alternatives, including possible alternatives for some of the geriatric patients currently under the care of the Human Services Center.\n\nLawmakers hope to take pressure off the hospital, said Sen. Susan Wismer, D-Britton, who serves on the committee to Redefine Nursing Home Criteria and Build Capacity.\n\n\u201cTheir reaction to the labor force issue is to cut beds, rather than compete for the labor force with pay increases and improved working conditions,\u201d Wismer said.\n\nIn agreeing to release claims against the state, money from the settlement will go to an estate set up in White\u2019s name and invested for the benefit of her six children. Their parents and guardians have a fiduciary responsibility to manage the funds, but it should be there for them when they need money for something like college, Bornitz said.\n\n\u201cHopefully the compensation that we were able to get for these kids can help make their lives better,\u201d Bornitz said.\n\nRead the 2018 federal report regarding Anne Elizabeth White's death at the Human Services Center in Yankton:"}}
