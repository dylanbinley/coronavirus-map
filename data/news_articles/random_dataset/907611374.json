In Hanau, German and Turkish flags flew at half-staff outside a mosque where worshipers gathered Friday.\n\nA 43-year-old German man fatally shot nine people with immigrant backgrounds in the Frankfurt suburb late Wednesday before apparently killing his 72-year-old mother and himself. Half of the victims were reported to be Turkish.\n\nThe man, identified as Tobias Rathjen, left a number of rambling texts and videos espousing racist views and claiming to have been under surveillance since birth.\n\nMore than 300 people attended prayers at the Turkish-speaking DITIB mosque attended by at least one of the victims. \u201cThe mood is subdued,\u201c said Adam Arslan, a friend of Gokhan Gultekin, who died in the attack. \u201cI cannot accept this crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay our almighty God rest the souls of our brethren who lost their lives in Wednesday\u2019s heinous racist attack,\u201d Fevzi Hoguk, the imam, or prayer leader, told the congregation.\n\nThe chairman of the mosque board, Memduh Onder, said the community was not afraid, \u201cbecause we are together,\u201d citing the memorial gathering in front of city hall Thursday evening where German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier spoke. \u201cThe thousands of people on the square, most of them were German,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, officials confirmed they had received a letter from the suspect last November in which he sought help from authorities in stopping the surveillance he believed he was under. The letter didn\u2019t ring any alarm bells with prosecutors, officials said.\n\nInterior Minister Horst Seehofer said state-level security officials and security agencies agreed to increase the law enforcement presence around the country. Seehofer said there would be more surveillance at \u201csensitive sites,\u201d including mosques, and a high police presence at railway stations, airports and borders.\n\n\u201cThe threat posed by far-right extremism, anti-Semitism and racism is very high in Germany,\u201d Seehofer said.\n\nThousands of people gathered in cities across Germany on Thursday night to hold vigils for the shooting victims but also to express anger that authorities haven\u2019t done enough to prevent attacks despite a string of incidents in recent years. Last week, authorities arrested 12 men \u2014 including a police employee \u2014 on suspicion of planning attacks on Muslims and politicians.\n\nSome have also called for a crackdown on the extremist and anti-immigrant ideology that has crept into mainstream political debate with the rise of the Alternative for Germany party, or AfD.\n\nDavid McHugh and Frank Jordans are Associated Press writers."}}
