LOUIS \u2014 A former pastor was sentenced Friday to 65 years in prison for producing child pornography and other offenses.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Audrey Fleissig also ordered that Loren Copp, 50, pay $294,000 in restitution to the victims to cover the cost of therapy and other expenses.\n\nCopp was convicted last year of eight counts of child sexual exploitation and enticement for acts involving four victims. He\u2019s the former owner of a combination pizza restaurant and martial arts studio on Morganford Road in St. Louis.\n\nCopp groomed two minor females who had been in his custody since 2009, federal prosecutors have said. He sexually abused them and recorded the acts, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in St. Louis.\n\nSomeone raised concerns with state officials in 2013 about Copp\u2019s behavior with young girls. After that he left his wife and moved to the restaurant and studio at 4601 Morganford Road."}}
