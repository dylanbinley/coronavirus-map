Those who resist fundamental change routinely suggest that people are too stupid to act in their own interest.\n\nDefenders of segregation claimed that civil rights protests and activities were caused by \u201coutside agitators\u201d and \u201ccommunists.\" College administrators and government officials denounced campus activists protesting the Vietnam War as \u201cdupes\u201d of foreign powers. The president himself never tires of blaming news outlets for reporting the obvious fabrications in his tweets.\n\nPeople who are, or will be, affected by the destructive practices of government, corporate and social institutions don\u2019t need anyone to urge them to protest being victimized. What they need is for those responsible to take meaningful action to remedy the problems.\n\nSteve Abbott, Columbus"}}
