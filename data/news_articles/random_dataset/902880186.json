The government has not said who it believes is responsible for the attack.\n\nTuesday\u2019s protests occurred in Bahir Dar, the Amhara regional capital, and at least seven other cities, according to the state-affiliated Amhara Mass Media Agency.\n\nProtesters carried signs bearing slogans like \u201cBring back our students\u201d and \u201cWe won\u2019t keep quiet about the kidnapped students\u201d.\n\nOpposition politicians and civil society activists have taken to social media in recent days to try to draw global attention to the case, using hashtags including #ReleaseTheStudents and #BringBackOurStudents.\n\nAbiy\u2019s government should \u201cbe seeking to share as much information on the fate of the students as possible,\u201d said Laetitia Bader, senior researcher for Human Rights Watch.\n\n\u201cFamilies have a right to know the fate of their loved ones.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to AFP, Abiy\u2019s office said Tuesday that a committee had been formed to deal with the case.\n\n\u201cHigh level officials as well as the security apparatus is closely monitoring the situation,\u201d the statement said.\n\nSource: AFP"}}
