Take as much time as you need to get to know this girl,\u201d which infuriated Harry.\n\n\u201cHarry was pissed off,\u201d a source said, \u201cPissed off that his brother would ask such a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome felt it was an overreaction. But then, this totally sums them up as people\u2014William the calm and rational one, and Harry, who can\u2019t help but take things far too personally.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry fell out with one of his closest friends, after he shared \u2018doubts\u2019 about Meghan Markle\n\nAnother excerpt from Finding Freedom claims Prince Harry was \u201churt\u201d after his close friend Tom \u2018Skippy\u2019 Inskip advised the couple to live together for a while before \u201cdoing anything more serious\u201d.\n\nA source close to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex told the book\u2019s authors that although his advice \u201ccame from a good place,\u201d Harry didn\u2019t \u201csee it that way\u201d.\n\nThe excerpt reads: \u201cIt really hurt him that someone he was so close to would not trust his judgment.\u201d\n\nThe book also claims that Skippy and his wife Lara were \u201cpunished\u201d by being excluded from Harry and Meghan\u2019s wedding party at Frogmore House.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s believed Harry and Skippy patched up their friendship last year, following the death of his mother-in-law.\n\nMeghan Markle underwent SAS training after being sent \u2018absolutely terrifying threats\u2019\n\nMeghan was apparently rushed into a two day training session shortly after her relationship with Prince Harry became public, according to Finding Freedom.\n\nThe former actress took part in a mock kidnapping, and was taught how to establish a relationship with her abductors at the SAS HQ in Hereford.\n\n\u201cThere have been some absolutely terrifying and stomach churning threats made to Meghan since she started dating Harry. Unfortunately, they continued for some time,\u201d a source told the authors.\n\nThe book also reveals how Meghan \u201cbarely slept\u201d after security teams intercepted an envelope that was feared to contain the deadly toxin Anthrax.\n\nThe authors wrote: \u201cWhile on the outside it seemed to be much like any other piece of mail received by the busy mail room based at Clarence House, this one was filled with racist musings and unidentified white powder.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe material feared to be anthrax, turned out to be harmless. At least physically. The night of the incident, though, Meghan barely slept, later admitting to a friend that she worried the incident was her \u2018new normal\u2019.\n\nPrince Harry had a secret Instagram while dating Meghan Markle\n\nAccording to the book\u2019s authors, Meghan began following the account @SpikeyMau5 on Instagram shortly after her first date with Harry \u2013 and they believe the account belonged to the Duke.\n\nThe username combined his nickname \u201cSpike\u201d with one of his favorite DJs, Deadmau5.\n\nAround that same time, Meghan had posted a photo of a candy heart with the words \u201cKiss Me\u201d on it, alongside the caption \u201cLovehearts in #London.\u201d\n\nMeghan and Harry\u2019s first date took place at Soho House\u2019s Dean Street Townhouse in London, where they chatted over drinks for nearly three hours.\n\nA friend told the authors: \u201cAlmost immediately they were almost obsessed with each other. It was as if Harry was in a trance.\u201d\n\nMeghan wanted her father Thomas at her wedding, despite being \u2018hurt and humiliated\u2019 by him\n\nDespite a strained relationship with her father Thomas, a close friend of Meghan told the authors that she wanted him at her wedding: \u201cAs much as she was hurt and humiliated, she wanted him to be there and was willing to move on.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlus, she was worried about him; she honestly wasn\u2019t sure if he was actually okay. His behaviour was bizarre,\u201d they added.\n\nThe book claimed Meghan texted her dad right up until the night before her wedding hoping to get in touch, but her efforts were pointless.\n\n\u201cThere were no easy solutions,\u201d a palace aide recalled, \u201cAnd they handled it about best they could even though to the outside world it looked like a total mess.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry\u2019s \u2018biggest disappointment\u2019\n\nFollowing the couple\u2019s decision to leave the royal family, Harry was forced to relinquish his roles as Captain General Royal Marines, Honorary Air Commandant, RAF Honington and Commodore-in-Chief, Small Ships and Diving, Royal Naval Command. The biography has claimed that when Prince Harry was stripped of honorary military appointments, it was a \u201ctough pill to swallow\u201d. \u201c[It was] the one that has been the most painful for Meghan to witness him go through,\u201d a source told the authors, \u201cIt\u2019s the one that made Harry emotional.\u201d\n\nMeghan apparently told a friend: \u201cIt was so unnecessary. And it\u2019s not just taking something away from him; it\u2019s also the entire military veteran community.\u201d \u201cYou can see how much he means to them, too. So why? The powers [of the institution] are unfortunately greater than me.\u201d Harry and Meghan were forced to fire Archie\u2019s nurse in the middle of the night\n\nThe book details an undisclosed incident which led to the Duke and Duchess firing their son\u2019s night nurse \u2013 after she was deemed \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201cunprofessional\u201d.\n\n\u201cMeghan and Harry were forced to let the nurse go in the middle of her second night of work for being unprofessional and irresponsible,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nAfter the incident, the couple reportedly hired a second night nurse who \u201cdid a fine job\u201d \u2013 but they were still uncomfortable trusting another person with their child.\n\n\u201cNeither found themselves comfortable sleeping through the night without going to check on Archie regularly,\u201d the authors claimed \u2013 adding that they instead hired a daytime nanny while they looked after the night shifts.\n\n\u201cHe and Meghan liked the idea that when they went to bed at night, it was just the three of them in the house. Cosy and private.\u201d\n\nMeghan was \u2018distraught\u2019 after palace aides scolded her for wearing a necklace\n\nIn the early days of her romance with Prince Harry, Meghan was photographed wearing a gold chain with the initials \u201cH\u201d and \u201cM\u201d on it \u2013 which didn\u2019t sit well with the royal family.\n\nAccording to Finding Freedom, Meghan received a call from a senior Kensington Palace aide, after she was papped wearing the necklace in December 2016.\n\nThe book\u2019s authors wrote: \u201cShe was advised that wearing such a necklace only served to encourage the photographers to keep pursuing such images \u2014 and new headlines.\u201d\n\nMeghan \u201csaid little during the call, choosing instead to simply listen to the counsel. But after hanging up, she felt frustrated and emotional.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile she knew the aide had good intentions, the surreal experience of having someone from her boyfriend\u2019s office tell her what kind of jewelry to wear or not to smile at a photographer was too much.\u201d\n\nAccording to the book\u2019s authors, a \u201cdistraught\u201d Meghan then called a friend and said: \u201cI can\u2019t win. They make out like I\u2019m to blame for these pictures, that it looks like I\u2019m encouraging them, that me even acknowledging the cameras may not be sending the right message.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. It was only yesterday that people online were saying I look miserable in pictures, because I was trying to just ignore the [photographer].\u201d\n\nWilliam and Kate \u2018barely acknowledged\u2019 Harry and Meghan at their final royal engagement\n\nAnother excerpt from the book suggests Harry and Meghan were barely speaking to William and Kate when they attended the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey in March, which was their final official engagement.\n\nThe authors wrote: \u201cWhile Harry and Meghan both greeted William and Kate with smiles, the Cambridges showed little response. It was the first time the two couples had seen each other since January.\u201d\n\nThe book claimed William simply nodded at Harry to acknowledge him, but the Prince apparently ignored Meghan completely.\n\n\u201cAlthough Meghan tried to make eye contact with Kate, the duchess barely acknowledged her,\u201d the book added.\n\nPippa Middleton was \u2018reluctant\u2019 to invite Meghan Markle to her wedding\n\nKate Middleton\u2019s sister Pippa was reportedly \u201cconcerned\u201d Meghan and Harry\u2019s presence could \u201covershadow\u201d her wedding day, according to Finding Freedom.\n\n\u201cThe media frenzy that followed their every move made them somewhat of a reluctant addition to the guest list for Pippa Middleton\u2019s vows on May 20, 2017,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\n\u201cBoth the bride and her mom, Carole, privately harbored concerns that the American actress\u2019s presence alongside Harry might overshadow the main event.\u201d\n\nThe authors also claimed that Princess Eugenie was unhappy with the couple for sharing their pregnancy news with family and friends ahead of her wedding to Jack Brooksbank in October 2018.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t go down particularly well with Eugenie, who a source said told friends she felt the couple should have waited to share the news,\u201d they wrote.\n\nHarry emailed the Queen and Prince Charles before they decided to step down as senior royals\n\nDuring Harry and Meghan\u2019s six-week \u201cbreak\u201d from work at the end of 2019, the couple decided that they no longer wanted to continue living their life in constant public scrutiny.\n\nThe book has claimed that Harry emailed the Queen and Prince Charles before Christmas, requesting a sit-down to discuss their options.\n\nThe Duke was allegedly told he couldn\u2019t get a private business meeting with his grandmother until the end of January.\n\n\u201cAt this point they felt like they had brought up the subject enough times with family members over the past year and they were fed up of not being taken seriously,\u201d a source told the authors.\n\nThey added: \u201cEveryone had their chance to help but no one did,\u201d which led to the couple releasing a statement announcing their intention to take a step back from their duties, seek financial independence and split their time between the U.K. and North America.\n\nOn the latest episode of Goss Chats, Goss.ie Founder & CEO Ali Ryan sits down with beauty guru Mark Rogers.\n\nFrom his upcoming wedding to surrogacy plans, Mark opens up about a hectic few months ahead.\n\n#GossChats is sponsored by top Irish aesthetic clinic Haus of JeJuve."}}
