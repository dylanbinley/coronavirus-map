Even before the coronavirus crisis, there was a shortage of doctors around the country; since the pandemic hit, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo have been urging retired doctors and nurses to help their colleagues on the front lines against Covid-19. (In early April, de Blasio told NPR that the city would need forty-five thousand more \u201cclinical personnel\u201d by the end of the month.) The alert made its way to the cell phone of Aleksandra Prasolova, who was sheltering in her apartment in South Brooklyn, working on a jigsaw puzzle to help pass the time.\n\nPrasolova, who is thirty-seven and moved to New York three years ago, is an anesthesiologist and intensive-care physician with nine years\u2019 experience in Moscow hospitals. In 2009, when the swine-flu epidemic reached Russia, she was working in the intensive-care unit at an underfunded city hospital. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t do a CT scan or MRI. We had nothing\u2014we had to work like in the nineteenth century,\u201d she told me. \u201cSome days, we had to wash out our gloves because we didn\u2019t have any others, and we just used them again.\u201d\n\nPrasolova registered online, but she knew it was unlikely that she\u2019d be called, because she doesn\u2019t have a medical license in New York State. She looked into getting one when she first arrived in the U.S., but the process in New York\u2014each state sets its own requirements\u2014involves passing the three-part United States Medical Licensing Examination, which is expensive to prepare for and take, and also requires the completion of a hospital residency of at least three years (four years, for anesthesiologists), which is difficult for a foreign-trained specialist to obtain. So Prasolova worked at a local clinic, digitizing medical files, and taught anatomy and physiology part time at a small private medical school. In responding to the alert, she hoped to be able to volunteer in some other medical capacity. On April 9th, the H.R. office of a hospital in Queens promised to e-mail her forms meant to establish her qualifications. She\u2019s still waiting for them. \u201cI\u2019ve been checking my spam constantly,\u201d she told me. \u201cI want to be useful somewhere, do something.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank based in Washington, D.C., there are two hundred and sixty-three thousand immigrants in the United States with degrees in health-related fields who are either working in low-paying jobs or are out of work. Many live in states that have been hit hard by the pandemic, such as New York and Florida. \u201cFlorida is the state with the highest number of college-educated migrants, but many are, for example, unemployed Cuban health professionals who can\u2019t convert their degrees,\u201d Jeanne Batalova, a sociologist and a senior policy analyst at the Institute, told me. Many work \u201cas cashiers, child-care workers, or taxi and Uber drivers.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, the governors of New York, New Jersey, Nevada, and a few other states have issued executive orders to relax the rules and issue temporary licenses, in certain cases. Governor Phil Murphy, of New Jersey, has issued the most flexible order to date, allowing temporary medical licenses to physicians who have practiced in other countries within the past five years and have at least five years\u2019 work experience over all in hospitals or clinics. The physicians do not have to have taken the U.S.M.L.E. Prasolova easily fulfills these requirements. But, in New York, Cuomo has taken a more limited approach: the state still requires passing the exams, though it has reduced the residency requirement to just one year. Two weeks ago, in Massachusetts, Governor Baker issued an executive order that reduced his state\u2019s residency requirement to two years. But, Eva Millona, the executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, told CommonWealth Magazine, \u201cSadly, many foreign-trained doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals in Massachusetts don\u2019t fit that profile.\u201d\n\nThe process became more difficult in 1976, when Congress passed a law claiming that foreign-trained medical workers were not as professionally competent as U.S. graduates, and that there was \u201cno longer an insufficient number of physicians and surgeons in the United States such that there is no further need for affording preference to alien\u201d doctors. Since then, a few states have passed small amendments to the law, but the path to licensing remains challenging for most. Cindy Huang, the vice-president of strategic outreach at Refugees International, who advocates for refugee doctors, told me that, even though the states control the process, \u201cthe federal government still could put together a task force to develop guidelines.\u201d President Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant stance, however\u2014on Tuesday, he announced a sixty-day suspension of new green cards\u2014would likely stand in the way of such an initiative. As the Times reported earlier this month, the White House has been making it difficult for four thousand foreign physicians to get visas to start residencies for which they have already been approved.\n\nGregory Maniatis, the director of the International Migration Initiative at the Open Society Foundations, has been discussing with organizations and officials in countries around the world ways to unlock their countries\u2019 credentialling processes. \u201cThere are all these people who can contribute, who want to contribute, and we are stopping them from doing that,\u201d he told me. \u201cAny person who is not overtly anti-immigrant,\u201d he added, would say, \u201cof course we should be doing that.\u201d The Open Society, with More in Common and YouGov, conducted a survey asking Americans if they would approve of foreign doctors working on the front lines of the pandemic. Seventy-five per cent said yes.\n\nJos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez-Pe\u00f1a was a primary-care physician in Mexico before coming to the United States in the nineteen-eighties, when the AIDS crisis was at its peak. He earned a master\u2019s degree in public administration, with a concentration in health policy, at New York University, then worked in administration at Bellevue Hospital. Along the way, he met many foreign-trained doctors who wanted to get back into the field. So, in 1999, when he started teaching in the health-education department of San Francisco State University, he founded the Welcome Back Initiative, which helps immigrant health professionals pursue the credentials they need and find education and job opportunities. It now has offices across the country. \u201cFrom New York to Washington State, folks are coming into our offices asking, \u2018Is there any way I can help?\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez-Pe\u00f1a explained why the licensing process is so challenging. The U.S.M.L.E. exams are intended for recent medical-school graduates, whereas foreign-trained physicians may have been working in specialized fields for years. \u201cImagine a cardiologist,\u201d he said, \u201cwho has been training abroad for years on heart problems, if he would be able to recall the names of bones in each foot, after many years out of school.\u201d In addition, the fee to take the exams, plus the cost of textbooks and other expenses, can amount to ten thousand dollars, which many immigrant doctors may not be able to afford, especially if they have families to support. \u201cThe immigrant that left Iraq probably didn\u2019t walk out with a hundred thousand dollars in his pocket,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez-Pe\u00f1a said."}}
