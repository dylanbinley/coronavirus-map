The directive to applies to about 150,000 public servants across the country \u2013 it\u2019s not known how many of them are firefighters.\n\nIt also brings leave arrangements for volunteer firefighters into line with those for Australian Defence Force reservists.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re helping get more boots on the ground and giving people who\u2019ve been out there for weeks some relief,\u201d Mr Morrison said.\n\nThe Prime Minister also called on large employers to follow the government\u2019s lead on volunteer leave arrangements, to ease the load on self-employed and small businesses.\n\nAnd he made clear he expected non-commonwealth government employees such as NBN Co and Australia Post to follow suit.\n\nThe federal directive comes amid heightened debate in NSW over support for volunteer firefighters who have worked on multiple blazes for weeks, risking lives and livelihoods.\n\nOnly a day earlier, the PM dismissed escalating calls for more pay for volunteers.\n\nWhether it was fighting fires, patrolling beaches, or supporting Meals on Wheels, Australia\u2019s system had and would \u201calways depend on having a large volunteer force to deal with these issues\u201d, Mr Morrison said while visiting an evacuation centre in Mudgee on Monday.\n\n\u201cWhat is particularly taxing during this fire season is the length and that\u2019s why I\u2019m taking advice from fire commissioners on what is best needed to continue to support access to that important volunteer force,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take my lead from them.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Mick Holton, the president of NSW\u2019s Volunteer Fire Fighters Association, said members had racked up expenses, including for petrol to drive to fire fronts. Others had used up annual leave to fight the bushfires that have stretched resources across the country this season.\n\nVolunteer firies queuing up at Bunnings to get much needed gear, paid for out of their own pockets. I could cry. \u2014 Claire Connelly (@_ClaireConnelly) December 20, 2019\n\nMr Holton said volunteers had resorted to crowd funding to pay for smoke masks.\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t we picking up the tab for legitimate expenses, like we do for paid people?\u201d he said.\n\nMr Holton said the situation was \u201cout of control\u201d.\n\nBut NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons rejected the idea, saying it fell outside the service\u2019s long-standing spirit.\n\n\u201cOverwhelmingly in my decades of service and even getting around some of these fire grounds in the last few days, the volunteers don\u2019t want payment. It doesn\u2019t make them volunteers,\u201d he told Sky News on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThey have given me that message loud and clear again and again. Its what I\u2019ve grown up with as the sentiment across the organisation.\u201d\n\nNSW Emergency Services Minister David Elliott also batted away any suggestion of paying volunteer firefighters.\n\n\u201cAnyone who is arguing we have to pay them doesn\u2019t understand the ethos of the volunteer in this country,\u201d Mr Elliott told The Australian.\n\nOn Tuesday, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese noted Paul Keating\u2019s government in 1994 made an ex-gratia payment to volunteer firefighters who\u2019d been in the field for more than seven days.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been prescriptive about what support should be required,\u201d he said on a visit to the Blue Mountains.\n\n\u201cI have, however, been very clear that people who are fighting fires, not for days or weeks but for months, still need to put food on the table for their families, still need to pay their rent and mortgages.\n\n\u201cIt is the least that can be expected that this should be looked at by the government and the government should act.\u201d\n\n-with AAP"}}
