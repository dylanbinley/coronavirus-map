That means Prince Harry and Meghan Markle aren\u2019t returning to London to attend Queen Elizabeth\u2019s annual Christmas festivities this week, including the monarch\u2019s Buckingham Palace party to thank the royal staff and the pre-Christmas lunch held at the Palace on Wednesday.\n\nQueen Elizabeth isn\u2019t taking the Sussexes\u2019 absence as a snub, reports the Daily Mail, and Prince Harry and Meghan had already informed the Queen of their decision when they announced their six-week respite. According to the Daily Mail, there were \u201csome royal officials\u201d who were hoping the Sussexes would make the journey back to London in time for the parties, but Prince Harry and Meghan, who are enjoying family time with Archie, likely aren\u2019t going back to the U.K. until after the New Year.\n\nSEE ALSO: The Stafford London\u2019s Hotel Christmas Decorations Are Royally-Approved\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan did attend the Buckingham Palace lunch last year; Queen Elizabeth hosts the party for the extended royal family before she makes her way to Sandringham. The Queen is only joined by senior members of the family at Norfolk, including Prince Charles, Camilla Parker-Bowles, Prince William, Kate Middleton and others. The Sussexes were at Sandringham to celebrate with the royals for the past two years, but this year, they will be spending the holiday with Meghan\u2019s mom, Doria Ragland.\n\nQueen Elizabeth is expected to travel to Sandringham on Thursday, and the rest of the family won\u2019t be far behind her\u2014Prince William and Kate will make the trip to their country home on the royal estate, Anmer Hall, soon after, as their two older children are now out of school.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear precisely where Prince Harry and Meghan will be for Christmas, but they reportedly spent Thanksgiving with Doria in the United States\u2014it seems likely they were in Meghan\u2019s hometown, Los Angeles, so perhaps they\u2019re staying on the sunny West Coast for the holidays this year."}}
