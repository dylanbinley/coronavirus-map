story of the \u201cLady in Blue\u201d is famous throughout the Concho Valley, there are still some folks in Texas who\u2019ve never heard of Sor Maria de Agreda.\n\nBut some of the top theatrical talent in the nation will be working change that with the upcoming \u201cLady of Agreda\u201d musical set to debut March 12 in Houston.\n\nThe production\u2019s story begins with San Angelo\u2019s Cynthia Jordan, who composed 33 original numbers based on the life story of Sor Maria.\n\nJordan led the rest of the show\u2019s creative team on a local tour Sunday and Monday to visit with area historians and gather a little more information as they prepared to kick off auditions in Houston later this week.\n\nJordan, who first met with fame after her 1982 song \"Jos\u00e9 Cuervo\" (credited as Cindy Jordan) topped the charts, later moved into writing songs for children, which led to a music ministry she called \u201cKids for Kids\u201d in 1986.\n\nSince then, she has recorded 11 albums of ambient piano music and written several books, which are available on Amazon.com.\n\nShe talked about how the \u201cLady in Blue\u201d musical came about.\n\n\u201cWhen I moved to San Angelo in 2005, one of the first things I did was go out to Paint Rock,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Mrs. Campbell told me the story of the Lady in Blue \u2013 and although I was raised Catholic \u2013 I had never heard of this story, and I just couldn\u2019t get enough of it.\n\n\u201cI went home and researched as much as I could\u2026 And being a composer, I wanted to tell her story with music.\u201d\n\nJordan said when she felt the compositions were ready, she traveled to Nashville in 2007 to record an album, toying with the idea of doing a musical.\n\n\u201cFast forward a bit, and we were doing several celebrations of the Lady in Blue in San Angelo,\u201d Jordan recalled. \u201cI met with Bishop Pfeifer, who introduced me to Tilly Chandler, and things began to develop from there.\u201d\n\nJordan said she believes those who know the story best will be pleased by the production.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited that people are going to be exposed to the story of San Angelo\u2026 I feel it\u2019s like Tombstone \u2013 That town is only famous because of the story of the OK Corral, and this absolutely amazing story is so much more powerful.\u201d\n\nJordan said that while she was skeptical at first, after doing a great deal of research on her own, she now challenges people to prove it didn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cIt happened,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t explain it, but it definitely happened.\u201d\n\nJordan said director Bruce Lumpkin was interested in working with her on another project she created, but after talking about the Lady in Blue musical, he decided to come on board.\n\nLumpkin, a Houston native, traveled to New York City after college where worked for director/choreographer Tommy Tune for more than a decade on some of the most popular productions on Broadway.\n\nHe said after graduating from the University of Houston he was noticed by fellow University of Houston alum Tommy Tune while directing a production of \u201cCompany,\u201d the 1970 comedy with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and book by George Furth at the Theater Under the Stars\u2019 Humphrey School of Musical Theater.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s won a lot of awards for his work,\u201d Lumpkin said. \u201cHe pretty much took me under his wing and I worked on every show he did from \u201cThe Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\u201d to \u201cThe Grand Hotel.\u201d\n\nWriting the book for the \u201cLady in Blue\u201d is award-winning director, producer and writer Marley Singletary, who said she first worked with Lumpkin in 2010.\n\nShe talked about the production.\n\n\u201cThis show is a two-act musical,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt takes us on a journey through Sor Maria\u2019s life, basically, beginning with the story of her bilocating to visit the Jumanos, and carries forward through two trials of the Spanish Inquisition, exploring her correspondence with the king of Spain through some 600 letters.\u201d\n\nSingletary said it\u2019s definitely a challenge to keep the production to two hours and still fit in enough of the history they\u2019ve learned.\n\nShe said the show will be staged at the Queensbury Theater, which is a 250-seat house in the Memorial City area of west Houston.\n\nThe executive producer of the show is Donna Cole, founder, president and CEO of Cole Chemical & Distributing, Inc. of Houston, who Jordan met when she was in San Angelo for a Chamber of Commerce speaking engagement.\n\n\u201cShe gave a beautiful speech and it really impressed me,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI was working at Miss Hattie\u2019s at the time playing music and I walked over to her table, and she was super gracious and lovely\u2026 Through that we became friends.\u201d\n\nCole is also a co-founder of the Pantheon of Women, a production company dedicated to telling great stories about strong women and supportive men in film, television, plays and musicals.\n\nThe show is slated for a four-week run ending April 5, and will feature an orchestra of six and cast of 16.\n\nTo learn more about the production, visit www.ladyofagreda.com.\n\nMatthew McDaniel is a journalist covering community news and faith-related
