In the absence of a deal he said he would call Assembly elections, which - following reverses in the Westminster general election - would not suit the DUP or Sinn F\u00e9in.\n\nAll parties said the remaining issues to be tackled were \u201con the margins\u201d. They related to matters such as an Irish language Act, a key issue for Sinn F\u00e9in; the sustainability of any reformed Stormont, one of the chief concerns of the DUP; and reform of the petition of concern, a vetoing system that allows parties which have 30 signatures to block motions even if these motions have majority support.\n\nWhile the DUP was blamed by the British and Irish governments for the failure to sign off on a deal last week, since then there has been a notable lack of serious recrimination between the parties, indicating that the general view is that a deal can be done before January 13th.\n\nThe DUP MP for East Derry Gregory Campbell, referring to the attempt to reach a deal last Thursday night, said there was \u201cno point in trying to bounce people\u201d into a deal.\n\n\u201cWe made progress but we did not make sufficient progress,\u201d he told BBC Radio Ulster\u2019s Talkback programme on Monday.\n\nMr Campbell said that everyone \u201cshould calm down and in the new year we will come back and let\u2019s finish that deal, get back into Stormont, and get Ministers in place\u201d.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Northern leader Michelle O\u2019Neill in a statement said her party \u201cremains focused on reaching an agreement in talks in the new year\u201d.\n\nResponding to a call from the North\u2019s main church leaders for parties to go \u201cthat extra mile\u201d for a deal, Ms O\u2019Neill said there was \u201ca real opportunity to successfully conclude the talks and have a sitting Assembly and Executive to address the crisis in our health and public services\u201d.\n\nShe said: \u201cThere is an overwhelming appetite in the public for good government formed without further delay.\n\n\u201cSinn F\u00e9in\u2019s focus is firmly on achieving an agreement to the outstanding issues and getting the political institutions back up and running and working for everyone in the new year.\u201d\n\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood MP has called on parties to reconcile their differences \u201cahead of three full years without government in Northern Ireland\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have an opportunity in this moment to restore not just the institutions of government but faith in the ability of parties to set aside their differences and act in the substantial common interests of those we represent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf this moment passes us by, it will be a long time before we get another,\u201d added Mr Eastwood.\n\n\u201cThe SDLP will do everything in our power to secure a resolution that delivers for public sector workers, resources our hospitals and schools, provides opportunity and hope to our young people and defends the most vulnerable. That is the challenge of the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nAlliance Assembly member Kellie Armstrong said the politicians were \u201cextremely close\u201d to agreement.\n\nShe added that the document the governments were still hoping to present to the parties in the new year offered a \u201cwin for everyone\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the DUP MEP Diane Dodds, who soon will out be of her European job because of Brexit, has been selected to replace Carla Lockhart as the Assembly member for Upper Bann. The seat became vacant after Ms Lockhart was elected MP for the constituency.\n\nThere had been speculation that her husband Nigel, who lost his North Belfast seat to Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s John Finucane, or Emma Little Pengelly, who lost South Belfast to the SDLP\u2019s Claire Hanna, would be co-opted to the seat. But the DUP leadership has now settled the matter.\n\n\u201cDiane will be a first-class advocate for the people of Upper Bann and brings a wealth of experience to the post,\u201d said DUP leader Arlene Foster."}}
