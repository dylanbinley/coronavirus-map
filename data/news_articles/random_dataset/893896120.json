Not all of them are vulnerable, but Republicans believe their path to the majority runs through many of these districts. A handful of Democrats who are the most vulnerable because Trump won their districts by double digits voted in favor of impeachment, including New York Reps. Anthony Brindisi and Max Rose, South Carolina Rep. Joe Cunningham, Oklahoma Rep. Kendra Horn, and New Mexico Rep. Xochitl Torres Small.\n\n\u201cParty and politics will never come before the country I bled to protect \u2014 and would unquestionably do so again,\u201d said Rose, an Army veteran whose district Trump carried by 10 points. \u201cCoercing a foreign government into targeting American citizens is not just another example of scorched earth politics, it serves as an invitation to the enemies of the United States to come after any citizen.\u201d\n\nOthers argued that failing to impeach the president would set a dangerous precedent for future administrations, even though they conceded the vote could cost them their seats in Congress."}}
