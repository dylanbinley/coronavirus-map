Speaking in French she said \u201clibrairies\u201d \u2014 book shops \u2014 could remain open.\n\n\u2018Librairies\u2019 vs \u2018krantenwinkels\u2019\n\nBut in Belgium this term is often also extended to news agents \u2014 which in turn double as tobacconists \u2014 selling daily papers.\n\nAnd when Wilmes made her announcement in Dutch, bilingual Belgium\u2019s other main tongue, she spoke of \u201ckrantenwinkels\u201d \u2014 newspaper stores.\n\nSo, according to a mail from the French-speaking booksellers\u2019 union, the ban has been taken to include book stores that do not double up as news stands, and those visited by AFP were planning to close.\n\nAt the \u201cLibrairie Europeenne\u201d near Brussels Jubilee Park in the European quarter that houses the EU\u2019s institutions, a sign was taped behind the window urging clients to order by email.\n\n\u201cIf anyone sees a book they want on our site or in the window, we can deliver, we\u2019ve always done it,\u201d smiled sales manager Nathalie Sebbe.\n\nBelgium is home to 11.4 million people and has seen a rapid spread of the novel coronavirus strain sweeping the world, with 1,486 confirmed cases and already 14 deaths.\n\nIn addition to the partial stay-at-home order, businesses have been asked to switch as far as possible to teleworking from home and foreign trips and large gatherings have been banned."}}
