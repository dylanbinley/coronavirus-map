The alleged understanding saw Elovitch ensure favorable coverage of Netanyahu at Walla, Israel\u2019s second largest news site, and critical coverage of Netanyahu\u2019s rivals, especially in the 2013 and 2015 election periods.\n\nIn 2012, the Communications Ministry set out a roadmap for the so-called Wholesale Market Reform, which it began implementing in February 2015. According to the plan, once the market was competitive and the various rivals were ensuring state-of-the-art service with competitive prices for internet, phone and digital TV services, Bezeq would be allowed to merge with its subsidiary units \u2014 allowing for the firm, which would inevitably be hurt by the competition, to cut some of its costs.\n\nAfter winning elections in 2015, Netanyahu, also communications minister at the time, booted out the ministry director-general Avi Berger, who had backed the reforms, and instead installed Filber, a long-time ally and his campaign manager.\n\nFilber reportedly described to investigators how Netanyahu quickly indicated to him that he should not let telecom prices drop by a dramatic amount while implementing the industry reforms. Filber also said that he was put under pressure to quickly approve a merger of Bezeq with its Yes satellite TV subsidiary, which officials in the Communications and Finance ministries wanted to make dependent on Bezeq first implementing the reforms. The merger benefited Elovitch by hundreds of millions of shekels, the report said.\n\nA day after signing an agreement to turn state witness Filber told investigators about a meeting he had with Netanyahu shortly after his appointment when the two had a private talk in the prime minister\u2019s office, Channel 12 reported.\n\nNetanyahu lit up a cigar and then allegedly told him that Elovitch been in contact about the telecom internet reforms.\n\n\u201cThis is quoting him,\u201d Filber told investigators. \u201c\u2018Elovitch spoke to me about the reform in the ministry, said something to me about a consultancy firm which laid down prices and didn\u2019t do proper work\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe [Netanyahu] said to me [Filber] don\u2019t cancel the competition [market reforms] but see what you can do in the matter of prices, perhaps to soften it over more time or make it [the drop in prices] less,\u201d Filber said in the transcripts.\n\n\u201cHe made a kind of motion with his hand on bringing down prices that instead of it being sharp and significant, that it should be more moderate,\u201d he explained.\n\nNetanyahu then said \u201cI also understood that the Bezeq-Yes merger needs to be completed quickly,\u201d Filber told police.\n\nWhen probed by investigators to explain what he understood from Netanyahu\u2019s remark, Filber said \u201cI understand that from my point of view that is the assignment\u2026and understand that there is a kind of deadline. What I understand is that I must do it.\u201d\n\nFilber explained he felt compelled to act on the matter because it was his first test as director-general of the ministry and because if \u201cout of all the ministry matters the prime minister raised that issue I understand that it is among the subjects that are important to him.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to Netanyahu, he told police, \u201cyou deal with what he asks the following morning.\u201d\n\nFilber admitted that in retrospect, he had struggled to separate between being a faithful ally of Netanyahu and acting objectively as a public servant.\n\n\u201cAnother person perhaps would have sat up and started to think [about things,]\u201d he told investigators.\n\nA statement issued on behalf of Netanyahu responding to the television report said of Filber: \u201cIt is a shame that in order to extract himself from actions he took that are not connected to the prime minister he needs to lie. Sad.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s tweeted that \u201cnot only was every decision on Bezeq-Yes taken with approval from the regulators and professional people none of whom were under Filber or Netanyahu, but it was specifically Communications Minister Netanyahu that during his term lead the wholesale market competition reforms which cost Elovitch and Bezeq billions, collapsed the Bezeq shares and saved billions for the citizens of Israel.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Avichai Mandelblit\u2019s lengthy description of Netanyahu\u2019s alleged illicit dealings with Elovitch, known as Case 4000, took up the majority of the 57-page document released in February in which Mandelblit set out the allegations that prompted him to announce a criminal indictment against the prime minister, pending a hearing.\n\nA pre-indictment hearing for Elovitch and his wife, also a suspect, was held earlier this month.\n\nNetanyahu is scheduled to attend his own pre-indictment hearing in the case on October 2-3, which will also cover two other corruption probes against him in which the prime minister faces additional fraud and breach of trust charges.\n\nCase 1000 involves accusations that Netanyahu received gifts and benefits from billionaire benefactors. Mandelblit said he intends to charge Netanyahu with fraud and breach of trust \u2014 the latter a somewhat murkily defined offense relating to an official violating the trust the public has placed in him.\n\nCase 2000 revolves around accusations Netanyahu agreed with Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper publisher Arnon Mozes to weaken a rival daily in return for more favorable coverage from Yedioth. In this case, Mandelblit will seek to also charge the premier with breach of trust, while Mozes will be charged with bribery. Mozes underwent his own pre-indictment hearing earlier in the month.\n\nNetanyahu denies any wrongdoing in all the cases."}}
