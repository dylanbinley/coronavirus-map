Gary Tillery, the artist who designed the monument, is a writer and artist with Fine Arts Studio of Rotblatt & Amrany.\n\nFor many Hatcher supporters, it was an honor that was long overdue, but one that will forever remind a young generation of Gary residents of Hatcher\u2019s special place in the city\u2019s history. Hatcher served for 20 years as Gary\u2019s first Black mayor. He ushered in an era of Black political power and brought together the nation\u2019s most powerful Black leaders for the historic 1972 Black Political Convention. Since he left office, Gary would elect four additional Black mayors. Nationally, some 500 cities have elected Black mayors since Hatcher\u2019s historic election.\n\nFor Freeman-Wilson, Hatcher held a special place in her heart. She was just 7 years old, when she first met Hatcher at a house party in the basement of her parent\u2019s house.\n\nAt the unveiling ceremony, she recalled how Hatcher inspired her to dream big. As the city\u2019s first Black female mayor prepares to leave office, she beamed with gratitude with a fitting tribute to a pioneer who paved the way for her and other Gary mayors of color.\n\n\u201cWe are here for a special occasion, but we are really here simply to say thank you,\u201d Freeman Wilson said as Hatcher sat a few feet away. \u201cIt seems only fitting and proper \u2026 that we acknowledge what folks around the globe have acknowledged\u2013the greatness among us in the form of a statue.\u201d\n\nFreeman-Wilson first announced plans for the statue in 2017 at a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of Hatcher\u2019s election in 1967. With three months left at City Hall, the monument is perhaps Wilson\u2019s special farewell after serving two terms at City Hall.\n\nThe unveiling capped a special ceremony that drew many prominent Black leaders, including former Mayor Thomas Barnes, incoming Mayor Jerome Prince, the Crusader Publisher Dorothy R. Leavell, Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan and Lake County Councilman Charlie Brown.\n\nReverend Jesse Jackson Sr. was scheduled to attend, but was in South Carolina, where he was being honored for his lifetime leadership in fighting for civil rights. His son Jonathan Jackson and Rev. Janette Wilson of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition attended on Jackson\u2019s behalf.\n\nAll of the leaders praised Hatcher, whose historic election in November 1967, stunned opponents and Gary\u2019s political establishment. Hatcher\u2019s daughter, Indiana State Representative Ragen Hatcher also spoke.\n\nDuring her speech, Leavell stirred the crowd as she proudly called Hatcher \u201ca disrupter\u201d who dared to shakeup the city\u2019s white political establishment that for so long had ruled City Hall while treating Black residents as second class citizens.\n\n\u201c[A disrupter] is not a negative term,\u201d Leavell told the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s a great term, because when no one will disturb the norm, a disrupter who knows what it ought to be will come in and speak truth to power.\n\n\u201cThank God for disrupters. If we didn\u2019t have disrupters, we wouldn\u2019t get anywhere.\u201d\n\nFarrakhan said Hatcher has been \u201ca servant not only to the Black community, but he struggled to make other communities more humane in how they dealt with the underprivileged and the forgotten.\u201d\n\nHatcher\u2019s youngest daughter, State Rep. Ragen Hatcher, said her father \u201ccares so deeply for the people of this city and for the city itself. He has three children, but Gary was always the fourth child in the household.\u201d"}}
