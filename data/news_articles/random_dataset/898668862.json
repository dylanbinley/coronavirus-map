He hasn\u2019t picked a candidate yet.\n\n\u201cReally undecided, so really like to keep all the options open,\u201d he said Saturday at a Bernie Sanders event.\n\nFor Tom Moburg of Altoona, it\u2019s a coin flip between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cProbably the one that can take down Trump,\u201d Moberg said this weekend before Sanders\u2019 event in Newton.\n\nThe Des Moines Register/CNN \u201cIowa Poll\u201d released Friday night showed 13 percent of likely caucus-goers are undecided, plus another 45 percent who said they were supporting a candidate indicated they might be persuaded to support someone else Caucus Night.\n\nSixty-seven-year-old Mary Jane Spies of Ankeny has ruled out a couple of older candidates.\n\n\u201cPartly because of the age thing and partly because of what they\u2019re suggesting is wonderful, but I don\u2019t see that it can be paid for,\u201d Spies said Sunday evening as she waited to see Pete Buttigieg. \u201cEverybody else that isn\u2019t in that realm they\u2019re so close that I haven\u2019t decided.\u201d\n\nBindy Brown of Des Moines has narrowed her choice down to Amy Klobuchar or Pete Buttigieg, who she saw speak Sunday night. So when will she decide?\n\n\u201cCaucus Night,\u201d she said, laughing.\n\nHundreds turned out this weekend to see some of the candidates campaign in Iowa. Tomorrow night, six candidates will debate on CNN. The Des Moines Register is co-host of the event, which will be staged at Drake University."}}
