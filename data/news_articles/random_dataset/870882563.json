This would be the sort of tariff imposed on exports if the UK reverted to trading under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules following a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cThe implications of what we are talking about are very straightforward and entirely predictable,\u201d he warned. \u201cEssentially Brexit risks excluding UK produce from the EU marketplace. A no-deal Brexit would result in the same outcome \u2013 but with that risk greatly increased.\u201d\n\nOwned by 2,750 farmer shareholders, Farmers First has two abattoirs which can slaughter 30,000 sheep each week (see box). The business processes about 10% of the UK\u2019s lamb and exported about 1m sheep worth almost \u00a3100m last year, including to 12 EU countries.\n\nSizeable market\n\n\u201cIt is a sizeable business entirely focused on the development of market opportunities and it sits right at the centre of export trading,\u201d Mr Gooding said. \u201cWe are dealing with the realities on a day-to-day basis for our farmer-producing shareholders.\u201d\n\nTo put a no-deal Brexit in context, Mr Gooding said a French customer was currently paying about \u00a3100 for a standard lamb carcass. If a 40% tariff was implemented, that would increase the cost of the same lamb to \u00a3140.\n\nFarmers First numbers 2,750 farmer shareholders\n\n2 abattoirs in England and Wales\n\n30,000 weekly slaughter capacity\n\n10% of the UK\u2019s weekly lamb kill\n\n1m sheep exported last year.\n\n\u201cIn a price-sensitive market, nobody is going to pay \u00a3140 for a lamb across the continent. In reality, a movement of very few euro cents per kilo is the difference between a French customer buying UK product \u2013 or a lamb from New Zealand or Australia or even Ireland.\u201d\n\nMr Gooding acknowledged that sterling may devalue further in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But he said if it fell by 40% \u2013 sufficient to offset any tariff increase \u2013 the challenges of the UK sheep sector would be well down the list of government priorities.\n\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t meant to be a flippant comment,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the greater scheme of things, compared to other sectors there is a very real danger that UK farming and the sheep sector particularly may literally become the sacrificial lamb of Brexit negotiations.\u201d\n\nWith about 35% of lamb production currently exported to the EU, a lot of sheep would be left looking for a market within the UK if British farmers and processors were priced out of the European market due to tariffs, putting downward pressure on prices.\n\nFewer farmers\n\n\u201cBasic economics shows that decreased demand and increased supply mean prices will fall,\u201d said Mr Gooding. \u201cThat is exactly what will happen.\u201d\n\nFarmers First was pursuing opportunities in non-EU markets \u2013 including the Far East and the Middle East. But these markets would take time to develop and would not take the sort of volume currently exported to European destinations.\n\nThe UK breeding ewe flock reduced by about 30% in the 2017-18 season \u2013 in part as farmers reduced sheep numbers in response to an uncertain future.\n\n\u201cWe would expect to see that sort of fall in breeding numbers continue,\u201d Mr Gooding said.\n\nThere would be a substantial restructure in sheep farming, he added. The farmers most likely to survive would be the most efficient producers who understood their costings, had low inputs and maximised their use of forage.\n\n\u201cMy own personal view is that there will be many fewer farmers managing what sheep there are in larger flocks \u2013 possibly running across multiple holdings. This will bring some people opportunities but it also means there will be casualties along the way.\u201d\n\nDefra says it will intervene to provide direct support for some farming sectors if needed under a no-deal Brexit. It says the government will ensure any disruption is minimised and has contingency plans in place to minimise any disruption to farmers.\n\nFarmer-owned exporter celebrates 20th anniversary Meat processor Farmers First \u2013 which trades as Farmers Fresh \u2013 was established 20 years ago to revitalise UK sheepmeat sales and secure better prices for UK lamb producers. Founded by a group of five Welsh farmers, rather than focusing on domestic retail sales the business set out to develop new markets for sheepmeat and increase UK lamb exports \u2013 a principle which still applies. \u201cAt the time, the European market was considerably cut off from the UK,\u201d said Farmers First director Mike Gooding. \u201cSo there is a crystal clear parallel between then and now of what can happen when you can\u2019t access such a huge number of potential customers.\u201d Farmers First was successful because it had clear goals, Mr Gooding said. It tried to be \u201cnimble on its feet\u201d while focusing on meeting consumer demand for high-quality lamb in markets where UK sheep producers were competitive. Some 2,750 farmers bought shares in the company to get its first abattoir up and running near Kenilworth, Warwickshire. In its second year of operation, it exported 1.1m lambs before the abattoir had to be mothballed during the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak. After the crisis, the company was the first lamb exporter back into the European market. Last year, it bought its second abattoir near Wrexham. Shipments have now returned to pre-foot-and-mouth levels, with almost 1m carcasses exported annually.\n\n\u2018Action needed\u2019 to protect UK sheep industry\n\nLeaving the EU without a deal must be avoided at all costs, says the National Sheep Association, which has called for urgent action to protect the UK sheep industry.\n\nThe EU is the destination for some 96% of UK sheepmeat exports. NSA chief executive Phil Stocker said: \u201cSuch a scenario would be disastrous for our industry at any time, but late October is when a huge peak of UK lamb will be reaching the market.\u201d\n\nA plan was needed to ensure that capacity and confidence was maintained if UK producers lost access to the EU market \u2013 even for a few months, Mr Stocker said. Doing so would ensure exporters could still operate once market access was restored.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of steps that are immediately essential and cannot be put off until October,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the event of an acrimonious no-deal, we could still be in a position where access to the EU is entirely closed. If not, then tariff relief is our preferred option to keep the market functioning.\u201d\n\nThe NSA also believes steps must be taken to temporarily close the UK to sheepmeat imports if UK producers are unable to export \u2013 with a focus on getting all domestic production into the UK\u2019s domestic markets. But it warns that this would be difficult.\n\nEarlier this summer, Mr Stocker said: \u201cIf plans are put in place now to invest in cold storage capacity then, using public procurement markets such as the armed forces, schools and hospitals, we can make the most of what would otherwise be a catastrophe.\n\n\u201cWhat absolutely must not be allowed to happen is a mass cull of lambs with no attempt to get them into the food chain. This would be an obscene waste and would have future capacity impacts for our sector. It can be avoided if the right steps are taken now.\u201d"}}
