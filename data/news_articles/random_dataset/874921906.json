(Sarah Ko | Daily Trojan)\n\nA Rance\u2019s Chicago Pizza co-owner is speaking out after the restaurant closed its USC Village location earlier this month amid an ongoing lawsuit against the University.\n\nRance\u2019s and The Butcher, the Baker and the Cappuccino Maker, another restaurant in the USC Village that shut its doors this semester, are suing the University for promissory fraud, misrepresentation and breach of contract. The store owners allege USC told tenants that students would be allowed to use dining dollars to pay for meals and claimed the University never told them there would be a dining hall in USC Village.\n\nAaron Tofani, co-owner of Rance\u2019s and a 2011 Price School of Public Policy alumnus, said the restaurant, which runs two other locations in Southern California, never turned a profit at its USC Village location.\n\n\u201cWe had no choice but to close,\u201d Tofani said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford to pay the rent because [it was] pretty high relative to the amount of sales that we were able to generate partially due to the significant amount of competition and other factors on the project.\u201d\n\nTofani said the University didn\u2019t disclose information about the establishment of the USC Village Dining Hall, which he said took away many of the restaurants\u2019 potential customers.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on [financial aid] and then you have to buy these meal plans, you don\u2019t have a lot of extra spending money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were under the impression that we were going to have access to the USC Card. Being on campus it made perfect sense, and the students have been asking for it, too.\u201d\n\nUSC denied the claims made in the lawsuit regarding dining dollars and the dining hall.\n\n\u201cThe University believes the allegations that Rance\u2019s and BBCM have made in their lawsuit are inaccurate, and we will vigorously defend against them in court,\u201d USC wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan.\n\nThe University also wrote that it had filed a separate court action against Rance\u2019s for falling behind on its rent payments over the last several months. Tofani confirmed the restaurant had failed to pay its rent on time for two months.\n\nTofani said Rance\u2019s worked on a new business deal with USC over the summer when the University wanted them to sign off on a clause that would exempt the school from any current and future claims the restaurant had.\n\nHe and his co-owner began going through past documents and said they hadn\u2019t reached their profit projections because of the promises left unfulfilled by the University. Other tenants they talked to had similar experiences, he said.\n\nThe tenants were afraid to come together because when they wrote draft letters on the issues in May 2018 and early 2019, a USC Real Estate and Asset Management executive allegedly threatened Rance\u2019s and other tenants against signing the letter, Tofani said.\n\nWhen the tenants started talking to one another, Tofani said they realized they had similar stories about the University\u2019s promises compared with their actual profit numbers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been set up in a situation where USC is acting as the banker with all these mealing plans, and they\u2019re acting as the landlord, and they\u2019re also the competition with the dining hall,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just realized that there\u2019s no way to succeed here.\u201d\n\nWhen BBCM closed its doors last month, the University told the Daily Trojan that it expects to see retailers in USC Village change over time.\n\n\u201cIt is common for retailers and restaurants to make business-based decisions about when to leave a location,\u201d the statement read. \u201cOngoing change is expected as USC Village continues to partner with retailers and restaurants to provide the best mix of services for the University and the community.\u201d\n\nBBCM said in the suit that the REAM executive framed the dining dollars as a selling point because it would bring a \u201csignificant boost\u201d in revenue and used Seeds, another storefront at USC that accepts dining dollars, as an example.\n\nRance\u2019s and other USC Village tenants continued asking for permission to accept dining dollars in their restaurants but were denied each time, the suit read. Rance\u2019s and BBCM also said the University promised USC Village would hold farmer\u2019s markets, tailgates and other events to draw traffic from the local community. Instead, Tofani said that during the summer and holiday breaks, USC Village vendors made little profit.\n\nTofani said Rance\u2019s had relied on revenue from its other locations to help retain the USC Village restaurant, and he hopes the lawsuit will help pay for the seven figures in losses he said Rance\u2019s gave up since the location opened in December 2017. He also said he hopes the University will improve conditions for other stores at USC Village by beginning to accept dining dollars and hosting community events that draw in customers during breaks in the school year.\n\n\u201cThe [USC Village] is a ghost town when the students and the workers are all gone for the winter,\u201d Tofani said. \u201cThat three weeks, you can have a cool experience for the community. Make the parking free, invite them in and they might discover their new favorite restaurant.\u201d"}}
