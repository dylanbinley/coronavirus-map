It added that the broadcast giant \u201chas been a champion of Philippine democracy and in upholding and promoting the democratic rights of the Filipino people, both in the Philippines and in the Filipino diaspora.\u201d TFC, it said, has been crucial in delivering news to Fil-Ams and \u201cin championing the rights of Filipino World War II veterans, and in the political empowerment of the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe deplore Duterte\u2019s move by a farcical quo warranto action in the Philippine Supreme Court to shut down ABS-CBN and cause the unemployment of its 11,000 workers. This move will drive a stake through the heart of Philippine democracy,\u201d the statement said, adding a call for Filipino communities across the U.S. and globally to protest the Duterte administration\u2019s actions against press freedom.\n\nCoalition spokesperson Atty. Rodel Rodis and other community members told the Asian Journal that there is a lot at stake with this issue.\n\n\u201cThis will send a devastating message to people that you cannot oppose Duterte because look what Duterte will do to you, like what he\u2019s doing to ABS-CBN. It\u2019s one thing to shut down Rappler, which is a small press entity. It\u2019s another thing to shut down ABS-CBN,\u201d Rodis said. \u201cSo he already has the Congress, the House, the Senate. He can do whatever he wants right now. And if we allow it to continue further, whatever few liberties we have, then we\u2019re going to lose it all. So we\u2019re determined to stop it.\u201d\n\nEmil de Guzman, who attended the event to emphasize the plight of murdered journalists and what he feels is an attack on press freedom, said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything to stand our ground now, to ensure that they will stop this, the next one will be somebody else\u2026 it\u2019s like a domino effect. They think they will have that sense of authority and power.\u201d De Guzman added that feels that the majority of Filipinos are being held hostage by a small clique in government.\n\nFr. Mark Reburiano of St. Gregory Church in San Mateo, who read a passage from the Letter of St. Paul to the Ephesians, told the Asian Journal that having differing opinions on issues should be welcomed. According to Fr. Reburiano, St. Paul is the patron saint of mass media.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to be able to have some disagreements or some arguments in order for us to search for the truth. And if we just shut down one company because they are not aligned with our ideas, or they disagree with us, that\u2019s unjust\u2026 Freedom of speech would mean also we fight for the truth. And we try to get the truth and we unravel the truth,\u201d Reburiano said, while adding that many of the network\u2019s subscribers, who are also his parishioners, have told him that they believe that ABS-CBN is balanced when it comes to its presentation of news and stories.\n\nDorie Paniza, who is a member of a few organizations and is an Arts and Culture Commissioner in Daly City, is hopeful that, in the end, ABS-CBN will get its franchise renewed by the Philippine Congress as the company sponsors many activities, including humanitarian in nature, and is a community stalwart.\n\n\u201cI really support ABS-CBN/TFC because they are really a big help to us, especially to the seniors. And not only to the seniors, but also to the community of Filipinos. Especially when we have disasters, they are there to support without asking for money, with their manpower and by [providing] advertisements. That\u2019s a really big help to the Filipino community, especially in the Philippines,\u201d Paniza said, citing the recent involvement of Bantay Bata Foundation in coordinating donations to the recent Taal Volcano victims and ABS-CBN\u2019s efforts in connecting the fruits of their fundraising efforts to institutions back in the Philippines.\n\nPaniza supports a franchise renewal since she sees how ABS-CBN programs, via TFC, keep seniors abreast of the goings-on in the Philippines and give them motivation.\n\n\u201cWhen I ask seniors, they say it\u2019s their therapy watching the ABS-CBN programs,\u201d Paniza as she was slightly overcome with emotion. \u201cEvery time I meet with them at 1 p.m., they tell me about the story of a movie or a teleserye. They say, \u2018Oh what happened to Coco Martin?\u2019 or what happened to this or that actor or actress. It\u2019s like their own therapy\u2026 it is just like they are not missing the Philippines.\u201d\n\nThe Asian Journal reached out to the Philippine Consulate General in San Francisco for a statement regarding the issue and the protest rally. Consul Vanessa Bago-Llona replied via email that the Consulate has no comment on this matter."}}
