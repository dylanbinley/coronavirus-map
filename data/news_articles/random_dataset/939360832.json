By that measure, the state\u2019s hospitals have been treating no fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 patients every day since July 19.\n\nNot a single day since then has the hospital patient load dipped below that 3,000 mark, according to records kept by the Georgia Emergency Management Agency. Compare that to May, when daily Covid-19 patient counts were in the 800s, dipping as low as 783 on June 7, the lowest daily number since the spike in cases in April.\n\nMeantime, Fayette\u2019s one hospital \u2014 Piedmont Fayette in Fayetteville \u2014 has recorded no more than 63 Covid-19 admissions in total since the beginning of the pandemic. But what puts that number in perspective is that the local hospital count includes only those patients who list a Fayette address.\n\nThus Covid-19 patients occupying beds in Piedmont Fayette who list other counties as their residences don\u2019t show up in the Fayette count, although they are occupying Fayette hospital beds. And Piedmont Fayette does not disclose how many beds are full and how many are empty to the public \u2014 only to the state.\n\nWhile many who work at the local hospital may know exactly how crowded or empty that facility may be on a daily basis, few others in the public are privy to that information. It\u2019s company policy, we are told. And the no visitor policy is still in effect there.\n\nMeanwhile, in Fayette, 19 new cases bring the case total to 1,047 Fayette residents with confirmed Covid-19. One new fatality is listed in today\u2019s report, marking the youngest victim so far \u2014 an African-American woman, age 49, with no underlying medical conditions.\n\nTHE NUMBERS: GA total cases \u2014 204,895 (+3,182). The single-day record increase of new case reports is 4,813 on July 24. The largest daily increase previously was July 18 with 4,689 new cases.\n\nGA deaths \u2014 4,026 (+42). The single-day record increase of fatalities reported is 82 on July 24. The previous record for deaths reported in a single day was 81 on July 22 and July 31. Death rate of confirmed cases \u2014 1.97%\n\nICU admissions \u2014 3,647 (+31). The single-day record increase of Covid-19 admissions is 85 on July 24. The previous record single-day Covid-19 admissions number was 75, set July 21.\n\nHospitalizations (total) \u2014 20,002 (+214). The single-day record of hospital admissions for Covid-19 is 447 on July 21. The previous daily record was 442 admissions on April 7.\n\nGEMA hospitalizations (Aug. 5 update) \u2014 3,077 test-confirmed Covid-19 patients are currently occupying hospital beds across Georgia, 17 fewer than the previous report.\n\nTotal molecular tests \u2014 1,724,762 (+29,538). (Antibody tests not included because they are not used to determine the number of confirmed cases.)\n\nFayette cases \u2014 1,047 (19 new cases more than the previous day\u2019s reported total of 1,028). The single-day record for Fayette cases reported is 40 on July 23. The previous record for a single-day increase in Fayette was 36 on July 7. DPH added a new metric that reports statistics for the past 2 weeks. Fayette had 280 confirmed new cases during the past 2 weeks.\n\nFayette deaths \u2014 26 deaths, 1 more than the previous report.\n\nFayette hospitalizations \u2014 63, unchanged from the previous report.\n\nFayette death rate per 100K \u2014 22.1 persons per 100,000 persons.\n\nFayette new cases since May 1 \u2014 870; average per day increase \u2014 8.87. New cases since July 1 \u2014 706. Fayette\u2019s average since July 1 \u2014 19.0 new cases a day.\n\n\u221aGeorgia Emergency Management Agency on Aug. 5 reported 3,077 confirmed Covid-19 hospitalizations across the state, 17 fewer than the previous report. GEMA reported 376 critical care hospital beds available (13%) out of a total capacity of 2,935 beds, as well as 1,255 (44%) of the state\u2019s available adult ventilators (2,872) in use. In addition, the state reported 1,641 (48%) available emergency room beds out of a total capacity of 3,425; and 2,695 (18%) general inpatient beds open out of a capacity of 15,067.\n\nThe graphs below represent a Fayette County report of cases over time in the first graph, and Fayette deaths over time just below that. In addition, we are adding the DPH graph of cumulative cases in Fayette over time (in blue) and cumulative deaths over time (the red line along the bottom of the graph).\n\nGraphs below show statewide cases over time and Covid-19 deaths over time. According to DPH, the Covid-19 cases over time \u201cis meant to aid understanding whether the outbreak is growing, leveling off, or declining and can help to guide the Covid-19 response.\u201d\n\nBelow is a current DPH chart of reported Covid-19-related deaths that have occurred in Fayette County since the start of the pandemic. The chart is updated to reflect the latest data \u2014 26 deaths attributed to the coronavirus.
