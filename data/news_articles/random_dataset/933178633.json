We need to be more careful because we expect the state to start recording Coronavirus cases.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the \u201ceasing of restrictions and the opening of borders and airports, it is actually time for us to be more proactive and adhere strictly to safety protocols.\u201d\n\nThe governor, however, assured that the state government will work harder to keep the state as safe as possible.\n\n\u201cWe will intensify our no mask no movement policy and other policies meant to keep our people safe. It is time for us to increase our vigilance. As a state, we will never go to sleep. Government will stay awake so that our people can sleep in peace,\u201d Ayade said."}}
