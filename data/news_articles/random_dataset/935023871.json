While GrabBayanihan has delivered protection and support to Filipinos during the early stages of the pandemic, Grab is again calling on the spirit of bayanihan \u2013 this time through local government partners across Metro Manila.\n\n\u201cWith responsible use of technology as well as our enduring partnership with the Quezon City Government, we hope to continue helping our kababayans in Quezon City who have been greatly affected by the pandemic, get back on their feet through the many livelihood opportunities available on our Grab platform,\u201d said Brian Cu, Grab Philippines President. \u201cWe are thankful for the trust and confidence that the city government has placed on us, as its partner in helping this great city through its residents, recover from the pandemic and navigate the new normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we transition to the new normal, one of our priorities is to address the needs of our residents whose sources of income were badly affected.
