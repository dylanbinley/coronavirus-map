Orr Stakes, with co-trainer Calvin McEvoy believing the time is right.\n\n\"We're really excited to see him step back out to 1400m,\" said McEvoy, who trains in partnership with his father Tony.\n\n\"We thought he was a miler during his early days, but with his racing manners we had to drop him back in distance.\"\n\nWATCH: Hear from McEvoy\n\nWhile confident of a bold showing on Saturday, McEvoy said that the stable wouldn't look too far ahead without him demonstrating that the 1400m is now a viable option for him.\n\n\"He's been very strong through the line over 1200m, we're going to learn a little bit and we won't make any future plans for his next run until we see him tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nMcEvoy likened this preparation to his first-up run at Sandown, followed by his G1 Winterbottom Stakes (1200m) victory in Western Australia.\n\n\"If you remember back to Sandown, he'd had six to eight weeks off, he tired late and then improved dramatically into the Winterbottom Stakes,\" McEvoy said.\n\n\"He had eight weeks between runs going into the Australia Stakes a fortnight ago and just got softened up a little bit through the run.\n\n\"He was entitled to knock up in that run, but he's tightened up and ready for the C.F. Orr Stakes now.\n\n\"If he shows that same improvement that he did in Perth, he'll be very hard to beat tomorrow.\"\n\nMcEvoy alluded to the fact that if he handles the 1400m on Saturday, he may head to the Futurity Stakes at Caulfield later this month before his grand final in Dubai in late March."}}
