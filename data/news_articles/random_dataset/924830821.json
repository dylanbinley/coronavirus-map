Will you join us?", "TEXT": "As Memorial Day draws closer, we\u2019re renewing our call for you to join us in honoring our fallen veterans.\n\nAt 10 a.m. on Memorial Day, we\u2019re asking you to sing or play the Star Spangled Banner while socially distancing. Do it from your driveways, your porches, your rooftops, in your back yards.\n\nThe idea came from Gail Van Prooien, a woman who said she\u2019s never missed a Memorial Day parade. But with the cancellations of parades and other commemorative ceremonies because of the coronavirus crisis, she wanted to find another way to show respect.\n\nShe got immediate support from Michael Boll, who served as a Marine in Desert Storm and is now president of New Jersey Veterans Network, an all-volunteer mobile outreach charity that works to provide veterans with \u201ca better quality of life through the donation of cars, housing, mental health services and job assistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this shows everyone who has been home during the pandemic that there are people who love this country and want to show their support in any way they can,\u201d he said. \u201cI think having the national anthem and sharing it with each other? It\u2019s a beautiful thing.\u201d\n\nCORONAVIRUS RESOURCES: Live map tracker | Businesses that are open | Homepage\n\nBoll said he is reaching out to all of the charity\u2019s partner organizations \u2014 from the American Legion to Knights of Columbus to Veterans of Foreign War (VFW) and more \u2014 to ask them to band together to support this moment.\n\nMorris Plains, which cancelled its Memorial Day service and parade \u2014 the largest in Morris County, according to the borough\u2019s mayor \u2014 is supporting the effort.\n\n\u201cOn Monday, May 25, Memorial Day at 10 a.m., we are encouraging all residents to go outside, stand on a sidewalk, front yard, driveway or porch, and sing or play The Star Spangled Banner,\u201d Mayor Jason Karr said.\n\nHe encourages other mayors to \u201caid in remembering our veterans by taking the time to say \u2018thank you.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe town will hang a \u201cthank you\u201d banner at the Morris Plains Rotary Park and more than 150 American flags will fly along Speedwell Avenue, Karr said. Additionally, he\u2019s asking Rep. Mikie Sherrill to prepare a virtual message for the Morris Plains VFW Watnong Post #3401.\n\n\u201cEven in this challenging time, it is very important to never forget the reason we commemorate this day annually, for it is for those who served before us and gave the ultimate sacrifice while defending our great country,\u201d he said.\n\nCORONAVIRUS RESOURCES: Live map tracker | Businesses that are open | Homepage\n\nDeptford Township is also on board.\n\nThe municipality usually has a Memorial Day parade that starts at the Oak Valley fire house and ends at Veterans Park, a park that was opened in 2014 and designed by local artist Frank Seder, a Navy veteran.\n\nAfter the parade, there\u2019s usually a barbeque with guest speakers, wreath-laying ceremonies and a service but the local VFW post.\n\nDeptford Mayor Paul Mednay said it\u2019s all going to be different this year because of coronavirus. The parade and traditional wreath-laying ceremony and barbeque are canceled, but there will be a small event at Veterans Park \u201cpark to lay wreaths while physically staying distant but never neglecting to honor our soldiers in some way.\u201d\n\nWreaths will also be placed in front of the municipal building with 100 small flags, he said, and the township\u2019s five electronic signs will commemorate \u201cour soldiers killed in battle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be joining with other towns encouraging residents to sing or play the national anthem on Monday at 10 a.m. We will promote the event on our Facebook page, website, Instagram and Twitter,\u201d Mednay said. \u201cIf we have time we will put up small signs in each neighborhood also.\u201d\n\nWe hope you will join us \u2014 and your neighbors \u2014 to honor our fallen veterans.
