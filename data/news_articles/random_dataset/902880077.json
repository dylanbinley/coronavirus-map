It\u2019s called CETA \u2013 the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement \u2013 and it looks quite impressive. Some 98 per cent of all duties that used to be levied on EU exports to Canada, and vice versa, are being abolished. European protected products (eg Italian Chianti and Hungarian salami) will continue to enjoy a sort of copyright protection.\n\nCertain Canadian services will be opened up to EU forms \u2013 financial services, transport and telecoms, for example. Most impressively, the EU and Canada can recognise each other\u2019s professional qualifications in certain jobs. Thus, in principle, a Canadian accountant could get a job as an accountant without further ado in Denmark; a French lawyer could practise in Quebec; or a German engineer could take up a position in Montreal and so on \u2013 but none would have any automatic \u201cright\u201d to do so, as exists today across the EU. And of course, this leaves out non-professional workers (such as journalists, as it happens).\n\nSound good? Canada doesn\u2019t have to send any money to the EU budget; there\u2019s no sense in which the Court of Justice of the European Union has supremacy over Canadian courts; there\u2019s no unrestricted freedom of movement for workers across the Atlantic; and the EU and Canadians being advanced civilised societies, have mutually agreed standards of environmental protection and workers\u2019 rights.\n\nNow, if you added in some clauses about sharing intelligence on terrorists, say, cooperating on data exchanges and some additional co-operation on areas such as overseas development, student exchanges, tourism, air travel and the rest, it would make a fine basis for a new relationship with what the government calls \u201cour friends and partners\u201d in Europe.\n\nExcept for a few things, though. First, Canada is not Britain. Britain is next door to the EU, and the movement of people, goods and services across the English Channel and the North Sea is obviously far larger than they are across the North Atlantic. We have a lot of fish, far nearer than Canadian stocks.\n\nThe economic relationships and social relationships, after a half-century of integration between Britain and the EU\u2019s remaining 26 members are obviously far more intimate than the relatively remote ones between the EU and Canada (even with the British interest, via historical and Commonwealth ties). The post-Brexit rights of British citizens on the Costa del Sol, and Polish families in Lincolnshire, for example, remain unclear \u2013 a big issue that simply doesn\u2019t apply to the relatively small numbers of EU and Canadians living abroad.\n\nMost trade deals are to do with dismantling barriers and making trade easier; the UK and EU are in the unusual position of erecting obstacles and making trade more difficult. In a way that should be easier \u2013 we start from complete harmonisation as if we were one economic country \u2013 but it can also be trickier, because of ingrained expectations. If we assume we can, say, use a UK driving licence to drive a lorry to Turkey in a year\u2019s time, or to export our cars as we do now, we may be disappointed, even under a CETA style agreement.\n\nMoreover, Britain might wish to diverge further than Canada does from EU rules on, say, the working time directive. The EU has made clear that the UK would not be allowed to do so without some corresponding reduction in access to EU markets \u2013 the level playing field idea.\n\n\u201cFree trade\u201d is not as free as it sounds. It merely means free (or free-er) access to goods markets, mostly without duties and quotas. It does not mean that everything can flow freely across borders as if they didn\u2019t exist \u2013 there will still be checks, on, for example, whether \u201crules of origin\u201d are being observed.\n\nTo take a topical example, it would be wrong for a Canadian entity to import a consignment of the famous chlorinated chicken from the US, and then re-export it to the EU, where it is banned. The chickens would be, by value, still overwhelmingly American rather than Canadian; but even if they were Canadian, they would not be allowed into the EU, tariffs or no tariffs. There is no suggestion that Canadian and EU product standards will be aligned \u2013 but that means checks and bureaucracy and costs.\n\nThere are many more such examples, and rules of origin can be complex and demanding. It is not the same, at all, as the current single market and customs union.\n\nLast, the CETA took years to negotiate and was held up in its ratification, semi-comically, by the Walloon regional parliament in Francophone Belgium, where the feeling was that the interests of dairy farmers and their (presumably French-speaking) cattle were not being sufficiently looked after. Eventually, the CETA crossed its final hurdles and was passed into law \u2013 but it took far longer than the11 months Boris Johnson has allowed for a deal.\n\nFrom the tangle of tariffs and restrictions that previously existed between Canada and Europe, it was a great step forward. But from the full membership and full freedoms currently enjoyed by the UK in the largest economic bloc on the planet, it would be a correspondingly retrograde step. No cause for celebration there."}}
