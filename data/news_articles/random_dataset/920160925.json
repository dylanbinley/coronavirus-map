Otherwise, he says they're going to fall through the cracks. 0:46\n\nSullivan said workers have expressed misgivings about the ability to practise physical distancing in the facilities.\n\nHowever, Sullivan said the prime minister's announcement failed to address support for harvesters, rather than those working in processing facilities.\n\n\"As a result of [safety concerns], harvesters in Newfoundland and Labrador and other places have delayed major seasons,\" Sullivan said. \"As a result of the delays and market problems related to COVID-19, we're going to have severe difficulties. There's going to be instances where people just can't make ends meet.\"\n\nRelief for harvesters forthcoming\n\nFederal Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan said in a Saturday news conference that help for harvesters is on its way.\n\n\"We also recognize that in order for the harvesters to continue to fish, they have to be able to sell their product. That's one of the reasons why the processors are the people that are first out the door,\" Jordan said. \"We are actively exploring other measures that will definitely impact other areas in the sector.\"\n\nJordan said in a statement last week that her department remained in talks with industry members and her provincial counterparts about season openings and the state of the sector during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe concerns raised by those in the fish and seafood industry come as meat processing plants across the country grapple with similar problems.\n\nOutbreaks of the coronavirus have cropped up at several facilities \u2014 including one death and hundreds of positive cases \u2014 at Alberta's Cargill plant south of Calgary.\n\nLabour shortages and health concerns have led to a number of plants temporarily closing their doors or reducing operations.\n\n\n\nTrudeau said earlier this week that the federal government would be monitoring Canada's food supply \"very, very carefully\" for shortages and rising costs."}}
