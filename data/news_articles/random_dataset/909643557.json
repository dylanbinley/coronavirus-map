It is estimated to have killed over 3.6 lakh people until December 2018.\n\nThe FSA is one of multiple opposition forces involved in the war, each of them driven by different agendas. Different groups involved in the war are backed by different countries, with Turkish support for the FSA primarily aimed at keeping a Kurdish militia in check in light of a decades-long insurgency at home.\n\nIf Pakistan mercenaries have indeed entered Syria, it will not be the first time they play a role in the West Asian nation. In the past, several have fought under the Hezbollah flag, backed by Iran.\n\n\u201cThere is a Zainebiyoun militia of Pakistani Shias deployed by Iran in Syria. We are looking into this new development involving Turkey and Pakistan,\u201d a source in the security establishment said.\n\nSources added that the use of mercenaries in support of Turkey could not have occurred without the blessings of the Pakistani deep state \u2014 the ISI. It remains unclear whether the mercenaries in question are drawn from terror groups backed by the ISI or former servicemen.\n\nThere are several organisations that recruit former and current Pakistani soldiers as well as civilians to work in security-related jobs in West Asia, where they play a role similar to personnel of the US\u2019 controversial Blackwater private security firm, the Washington-based think-tank Middle East Media Research Institute had said in 2011 while talking about Pakistan\u2019s mercenary business.\n\nPakistan also formally sent its troops to ally Saudi Arabia, which backs some opposition fighters in Syria (rival Iran supports the Bashar al-Assad administration) on a \u201ctraining and advice mission\u201d in 2018.\n\nFormer Pakistan Army chief General Raheel Sharif (Retd) commands the Saudi-led Islamic military alliance to fight terrorism.\n\nAlso Read: Syria exiled several archaeologists, I am one of them & this is what war is costing us\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram\n\nWhy news media is in crisis & How you can fix it You are reading this because you value good, intelligent and objective journalism.
