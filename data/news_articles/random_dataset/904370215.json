They were escorted off the plane, at which time medical professionals took their temperatures. Some of the passengers were then loaded back onto the plane and will continue on to Omaha, Nebraska. Fewer than 100 of the passengers will be kept at the air force base.\n\nAll the evacuees will be under federal quarantined for 14 days from the time the plane left China.\n\n\u201cIt may seem surprising to some that we are taking such aggressive measures,\u201d CDC's Capt.
