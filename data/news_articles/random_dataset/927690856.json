Ashraf Amra APA images\n\nAbdullah Abu Halima supplies 15 of Gaza\u2019s florists with roses, lilies and carnations.\n\nUntil recently, he would sell them between 2,000 and 3,000 flowers daily. Yet the COVID-19 pandemic has caused demand to plummet.\n\n\u201cSometimes I can barely sell 300 flowers per day now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe restrictions that have been in place since March have meant that \u201cwe missed the best-selling days\u201d of an average year, he added. They included Mother\u2019s Day, graduation ceremonies and family visits during Ramadan.\n\nWeddings \u2013 celebrations that typically involve floral displays \u2013 have also been postponed.\n\nLocated in the Beit Lahiya region, the Abu Halima farm is the only one that grows flowers for commercial purposes in northern Gaza.\n\nIt is not the first time that the family has been forced to scale back its activities.\n\nBack in the 1990s \u2013 the decade that the family joined the flower trade \u2013 the farm was 6 acres in size. Today, it is less than 1 acre.\n\nSlump under siege\n\nThe slump can be attributed directly to Israel\u2019s policies. In the early years of this century, Gaza exported between 50 and 60 million flowers to the Netherlands \u2013 a vitally important market \u2013 annually.\n\nAll that has changed.\n\nFlower exports have been severely curtailed since Israel tightened its blockade of Gaza in 2007. While some flower exports continued in the first few years after the siege was tightened, Israel has blocked them from 2014 \u2013 the year it launched a major offensive against Gaza \u2013 onwards.\n\nEven before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared, fears had been expressed that commercial flower production was on the verge of collapse in Gaza.\n\n\u201cI wish Israel would allow us to export flowers again,\u201d said Abdullah Abu Halima. \u201cThe demand in Gaza is very small.\u201d\n\nAdham al-Bassiouni, a representative of Gaza\u2019s agriculture ministry, noted that flowers \u201cused to be one of the main cash crops\u201d in the Strip.\n\nThat situation is at complete variance with the reality of today\u2019s Gaza, where restrictions were introduced after the first cases of the coronavirus were confirmed in March. \u201cMany people have lost their jobs and they can barely feed their families,\u201d said al-Bassiouni. \u201cSo buying flowers is considered an unnecessary luxury.\u201d\n\nFlower cultivation was developed in Gaza during the 1990s with the support of a Dutch aid program.\n\nIt was not long before the flower business was beset by a series of problems.\n\nMany greenhouses and farms were targeted by Israel during the second intifada. As a result, commercial flower cultivation halted almost completely in northern Gaza around 2003.\n\nOver the past 17 years, flower cultivation has mainly been confined to the southern half of the Strip.\n\nThere are only four farms that still grow flowers for commercial purposes in Gaza today. They include a farm in the Khan Younis area that produces ruscus, green plants that are often used as fillers when arranging bouquets.\n\n\u201cWithout the ruscus, flowers can\u2019t be sold in an attractive way,\u201d said Yousif Abu Arada, 31, who runs the Khan Younis farm.\n\nDemand has fallen so steeply under the COVID-19 restrictions that he is feeding his ruscus crop to goats and sheep.\n\nHe has let go the four workers who had been employed on his family\u2019s 2.5 acre farm.\n\nHe was also hoping to help a younger brother to complete the construction of an apartment and to pay for a wedding celebration. Because of the losses incurred this year, his brother has delayed the wedding.\n\n\u201cWorse than wars\u201d\n\nThe Abu Arada family has been growing flowers since 1992 and has kept doing so despite Israel\u2019s three major attacks on Gaza since December 2008.\n\n\u201cWe went through bad times during the wars, but this is worse than the Israeli wars,\u201d he said.\n\nAbu Arada pointed out that the family sold ruscus leaves for use in floral tributes to Palestinians killed during those attacks. \u201cAnd then after the ceasefires people were able to visit each other again,\u201d he added. \u201cBut now people are avoiding each other and their income has decreased due to the [COVID-19] restrictions.\u201d\n\nLubbad Hijazi, 20, and his family grow flowers on their farm in Rafah, a city near Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt. The farm \u2013 also 2.5 acres in size \u2013 is a key source of income for about 40 relatives.\n\nThe Hijazi family grows flowers using seedlings imported from Israel. Yet they have lost so much money this spring, they have been unable to afford new seedlings for the next planting season.\n\n\u201cNo one is thinking about buying flowers now,\u201d said Hijazi. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have any other job. So we keep hoping that the virus will go away.\u201d\n\nHana Adli is a journalist based in Gaza."}}
