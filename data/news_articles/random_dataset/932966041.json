We have to maintain our border security so we can protect the progress we\u2019ve made here in British Columbia,\u201d Horgan said.\n\n\u201cWe do not want to make it more difficult for people to get home but if you\u2019re going home you should go straight home. You shouldn\u2019t be stopping along the way to enjoy the sights and sounds of British Columbia. That\u2019s not part of the plan.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said in mid-June that the federal government is looking into reports of U.S. tourists flouting measures around the border shutdown.\n\nThe federal government extended the mandatory quarantine order for most people entering Canada until the end of August to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The order made under the Quarantine Act, which first came into effect in late March, was set to expire at midnight Tuesday, but will now remain in effect until Aug. 31.\n\nHorgan said he has maintained during 15 consecutive weeks of meetings with the other premiers, Trudeau and Freeland that the border needs to remain closed until the U.S. demonstrates it has \u201ca handle on this pandemic.\u201d\n\nProvincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said those coming into the province should recognize that British Columbians have a vested interest in making sure visitors follow \u201cour travel manners.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot here and it has been a sacrifice for everybody in this province and so there are concerns there are people coming in from jurisdictions that are still very much at risk,\u201d she told a news conference in Victoria.\n\nHenry said she supports closing the border to non-essential travel, adding that the situation in Washington state and the broader United States is \u201cchallenging.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have been actively working for, as we know, a long time to control the outbreak,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think it really speaks to once you get a level of transmission in the community with this virus, it is so, so challenging to get ahead of it and that is one of the things that we\u2019ve been able to do here in B.C. early on with the testing that we had, and here in Canada. We seem to be managing it but we know that there\u2019s still risks.\u201d\n\nLoading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...
