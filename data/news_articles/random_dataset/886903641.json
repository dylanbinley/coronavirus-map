The potholes along the road had witnessed a number of patches, but even the potholes that were patched last year have already gone off.\n\n\u201cWhat this road requires now is total rehabilitation not patching of potholes. So we want the federal government to look at the possibility of awarding contract for the total rehabilitation of the road. \u201d\n\nThe Kano-Gwarzo-Dayi road is a major link to Katsina, Sokoto, Zamfara and Kebbi states, as well as parts of Niger Republic.\n\nThe road was constructed during the administration of ex- military President Ibrahim Babangida.\n\nEarlier in the week, Fashola had told state house correspondents that roads in the country were not as bad as being portrayed.\n\nThe minister\u2019s comment had generated an outrage, with a federal lawmaker challenging him to a road tour.\n\nBut Fashola said his comment was taken out of context."}}
