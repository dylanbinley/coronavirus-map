That\u2019s important to me so thanks for getting that. Have a beautiful day. Sending so much love!\u201d\n\nDespite letting many people down for depriving them of new thrist traps of her gorgeous man (especially since he isn\u2019t on Instagram), Mendes did tell her followers how much she enjoys interacting with them.\n\n\u201cI take so much joy from connecting to other women,\u201d she added. \u201cIt means so much to me. Even just a quick exchange. I struggle with Social Media but I love the constant connection with women. I try to post responsibly and I try to make sure I don\u2019t portray myself in a way that makes other women feel bad.\u201d\n\nAnd while the mother of two may not share new pics of her partner of nine years, she recently opened up about Gosling\u2019s culinary skills by telling a fan he\u2019s an \u201camazing chef AND baker.\u201d Swoon!\n\nMendes and Gosling have been together since meeting in 2011 while filming \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines.\u201d The couple share two daughters, Esmeralda, 5, and Amada, 3.\n\nUntil further notice, keep an eye out for those Gosling throwbacks!\n\nLISTEN NOW on the RADIO.COM App\n\nFollow RADIO.COM\n\nFacebook | Twitter | Instagram"}}
