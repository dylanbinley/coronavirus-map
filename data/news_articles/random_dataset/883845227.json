In July, he launched a Commission on Unalienable Rights, created by religious conservatives who have bemoaned growing LGBTQ equality. Then in October, a private Pompeo speech, \u201cBeing a Christian Leader,\u201d was advertised across the top of the State Department homepage.\n\nLess noticed was the creation of the State Department\u2019s first faith-based affinity group.\n\nGRACE, announced in February, was founded \u201cto highlight the value added by the perspective of people of faith in general, and Christians in particular to the Department and its mission.\u201d\n\nUsing government email accounts, department portals and meeting spaces to organize and advertise, GRACE was, according to the mission statement of the group on the department website, created to advocate for religious freedom and expression within the department. It has hosted events with evangelical speakers and runs a \u201cmentorship ministry\u201d that brings together pairs of employees to focus on \u201chow being a disciple of Christ impacts your professional experience at the State Department.\u201d\n\nThe existence of a faith-based professional group doesn\u2019t itself stick out in Washington, where Bible-study groups gather all around Capitol Hill and prayer breakfasts for politicians are common. But as an official part of an administration that has consistently emphasized the concerns and rights of one segment of American religion \u2013 social conservatives and, in particular, white evangelicals \u2013 this first-ever Christian-specific employee group is being watched by church-state experts, former leaders of faith-based work at State and some employees.\n\nJack Moline, executive director of the Interfaith Alliance, said the group is problematic because, by using government resources during working hours, it appears to violate the constitutional ban on the government establishing \u2013 or favoring \u2013 a particular religious group. That, Moline says, is what makes it different from other affinity groups.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution doesn\u2019t prohibit bowling leagues, but it\u2019s very clear about religion,\u201d said Moline, whose group works to protect boundaries between religion and government. On its website, the group describes itself as an \u201calternative voice to the Religious Right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere needs to be caution anytime government comes near promotion of a faith tradition or faith in general,\u201d Moline said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been concerned about lots of officials in the Trump administration. This is not helped by the State Department homepage featuring Secretary Pompeo talking about being a Christian leader.\u201d\n\nPompeo\u2019s Oct. 11 speech to the American Association of Christian Counselors was featured on the department\u2019s homepage that day. The talk in Tennessee included a section on how faith guides his leadership decisions, including to find \u201cevery dollar\u201d of government funding that might support abortion overseas and end it.\n\nGRACE is one of 14 affinity groups at the State Department, including ones organized for black, LGBTQ and disabled employees, among others.\n\nTrump officials\u2019 handling of religion has been a subject of controversy in some quarters. The White House has worked diligently to woo Christian social conservatives, many of whom say religious freedom is a major priority. At the same time, questions are being raised by other religious groups who say they are being harmed. Since President Trump took office, travel has been restricted from multiple Muslim-majority countries, and concerns about anti-Semitism are rising.\n\nMore than two dozen of the 176 people from the State Department\u2019s staff on a GRACE distribution list didn\u2019t return requests to talk to The Washington Post, including its leadership. The sole response came from a woman who wrote back to say she\u2019d been moved overseas and couldn\u2019t comment. Some leading advocates who normally focus on the way religion affects policy at the State Department declined to comment for this story, including Tom Farr at the Religious Freedom Institute and staff with the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent government agency that works to elevate the religious aspects of U.S. foreign policy.\n\nAfter The Post asked the agency to reconsider its response, its chairman Tony Perkins, a leading Christian conservative, agreed to an interview. He said an increase in expressions of faith at State is positive because it shows the huge swath of religious people around the world that American foreign policy actors are empathetic. In the 1990s, he said, he was a contractor with the State Department and was investigated after inviting some people to come to church with him.\n\nPompeo is in a better position to understand religious people elsewhere, Perkins said, because he is open about his faith. The secretary\u2019s speech on Christian leadership is \u201cmore transparency \u2013 just saying: \u2018This is who I am, this is what I believe.\u2019 Everything is on the table.\u201d\n\nThe department declined to make Pompeo available and spokespeople declined to answer questions about the group, the role of religion in the department and whether GRACE raises legal issues \u2013 including with the group\u2019s mission statement that says its outreach extends to contractors. Some church-state legal experts say this could be problematic and appear religiously coercive if those are people seeking to secure funding from the State Department.\n\nIn a brief written statement by an unidentified spokesperson, the department said affinity groups have grown in number in the past decade at State. Their primary mission, the statement reads, is \u201cto promote diversity and inclusion.\u201d Groups are approved (or denied) by the chief diversity officer. \u201cGRACE bylaws show they are open to all employees regardless of religious affiliation and their reported election procedures meet the same standard,\u201d the spokesperson wrote.\n\nThe spokesperson said no other faith-based group has submitted a petition for approval, though Shaun Casey, the head of a 30-person religion office created under President Barack Obama within the State Department and largely shuttered under Trump, said a group of Muslim employees during his tenure did discuss the possibility of such a group with civil rights officials with State.\n\nCasey was U.S. special representative for religion and global affairs and director of the State Department\u2019s Office of Religion and Global Affairs. He wasn\u2019t certain if a formal request was made by Muslim staffers.\n\nUntil a decade or two ago, it was common to hear conservatives in particular worry that religion was unwelcome at the State Department \u2013 in the culture of the place and in conversations about its role in foreign policy. Christian conservatives in particular felt that persecuted Christian minorities in Muslim countries didn\u2019t get enough attention or help.\n\nThat changed, some experts say, with developments including the 2006 publication of a memoir by former secretary Madeleine Albright, one of Bill Clinton\u2019s leaders at State, about the powerful and important role of faith in world affairs. Also important were the creation, under Clinton, of the Office of International Religious Freedom within the State Department in the late 1990s and the 2011 creation by then-Secretary Hillary Clinton of an expanded dialogue with civil society groups, in particular religious ones, around the world, said Chris Seiple, a global policy adviser to the World Evangelical Alliance who co-chaired sidebar events at two recent international religious freedom meetings Pompeo convened.\n\nSeiple said the State Department is in the midst of a \u201cgolden age,\u201d with people from various faiths working together to protect international religious freedom \u2013 including for people who reject religion. He praised Sam Brownback, the department\u2019s ambassador at large for international religious freedom, for engaging faith-based civil society groups and for meeting often on Capitol Hill with religious liberty groups.\n\n\u201cAll of this is beyond positive\u201d but comes with an asterisk, he said, noting the perception that the Trump administration is working only for one faith community, a segment of white evangelicals.\n\n\u201cMy personal view is when State has (the piece about Pompeo\u2019s faith) on its homepage, that crosses the line,\u201d Seiple said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very fine line, but it\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nThe posting of the speech could raise questions about whether government officials are promoting certain policies because those policies jibe with their religious views \u2013 not because they are in the interest of the general public, Seiple said. \u201cThat\u2019s not good,\u201d he said.\n\nCasey disagreed with Seiple\u2019s \u201cgolden age\u201d description, pointing to what he says is the shrinking of State\u2019s general religion department \u2013 meant to educate diplomats about the role of religion and religious players in various foreign affairs issues \u2013 from 30 to less than five, he said.\n\n\u201cThe primary design of (high-profile efforts on religion) all this is to keep fundamentalist Christians happy,\u201d he said. Pompeo organized two high-level \u201cministerials\u201d connecting global religious leaders, \u201cbut look at their actual policies. Look at all the Christians exposed to ethnic cleansing in Syria. The state of religious freedom hasn\u2019t gotten better in the past two years.\u201d\n\nRabbi David Saperstein, the department\u2019s international religious freedom ambassador under Obama, praised Brownback for \u201cbending over backward\u201d to make sure that religious freedom efforts aren\u2019t \u201cChristian-centric.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a really good job,\u201d Saperstein said.\n\nHe said he encountered no problems as a person of faith during his years working at the department. \u201cI found only openness.\u201d\n\nAs far as Pompeo\u2019s private speech to the meeting of the American Association of Christian Counselors, Saperstein said the key for a religious government official is to be clear about how you present yourself.\n\nHe said when he was ambassador and spoke to Jewish groups, he always clarified he was there as an individual person, not as ambassador. \u201cYou don\u2019t lose your right to be a religious individual when you go into government service.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Jimmy Carter \u201ctaught Sunday school his whole time as president. Lots of government officials do things like that.\u201d\n\nThe question for Pompeo, he said, is: \u201cAre you going as secretary of state, or as an individual who happens to be in government service, and how are you seen by people you\u2019re speaking to?\u201d\n\nAs for then posting the speech on the State Department website, it depends on the intention behind showcasing it, Saperstein said.\n\nIs Pompeo emphasizing \u201cbeing a leader who is inspired by Christian values? If it\u2019s, like, being a leader of Christians, it\u2019s problematic.\u201d\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\u00ab Previous\n\nNext \u00bb\n\nfiled under:"}}
