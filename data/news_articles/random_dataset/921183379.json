The appellate panel noted in its opinion that Three-C had made similar arguments when it lost two lawsuits against Nationwide in 2017.\n\nThe appellate court ruled in those cases that an auto body shop cannot pursue an unjust enrichment claim against an insurance carrier because its services confer no direct benefit to the insurer.\n\n\u201cIn the present case, Three-C gives us no compelling reason to depart from our precedent in the Nationwide cases,\u201d District Judge Susan Brown said in the panel opinion. \u201cAlthough Three-C argues that the benefit to Liberty is that Three-C satisfied Liberty\u2019s contractual obligations to restore the vehicles to their pre-accident condition, any effect upon Liberty\u2019s contractual duties was merely an incidental consequence of Three-C\u2019s agreements with its customers to repair their vehicles.\u201d\n\nI think for them its better to roll the dice and see where the case goes. I've never seen them back away from a fight. -- Kesha Kinsey\n\nTriple-C is a family owned business founded in 1956 by current owner Bob Juniper\u2019s father. What started out as a 1,200-square-foot repair shop now occupies 12 acres in North Columbus and does $11 million in repairs annually, according to the company\u2019s website. Triple-C also has a shop in Chillicothe, Ohio.\n\nKesha D. Kinsey, an attorney for Liberty Mutual, said the company has long history of going to court to get its way. She said typically Triple-C submits two or three supplemental reports after providing an initial estimate. As those supplemental reports stack up costs, at some point the insurance carrier may decide the cost of repairs exceeds the replacement value of the vehicle.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened when Liberty Mutual policyholder Dan Lobdell brought his car in for repair at Three-C, Kinsey said. Liberty Mutual paid $12,506.81 to get repairs started, but Three-C submitted a supplemental report that proved too pricey for the carrier\u2019s taste. Liberty Mutual instead decided the vehicle was a total loss, issued a check to Lobdell for the replacement value, and asked Three-C for a refund.\n\nThe body shop argued that Liberty Mutual owed it that money and more for past \u201cshort pays\u201d \u2014 meaning the difference between the amount it had invoiced for repairs to other vehicles and the amount the carrier paid for those repairs.\n\nLiberty Mutual filed suit in May 2018 to retrieve its money. Three-C filed a counterclaim alleging that the carrier owed it $55,555.71 for underpaying for repairs to 56 vehicles.\n\nKinsey said she never thought Three-C had much chance of collecting on those claims, but she wasn\u2019t surprised that the company went to court.\n\n\u201cThey do this a lot to insurers,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the way they make their money. I think for them its better to roll the dice and see where the case goes. I\u2019ve never seen them back away from a fight.\u201d\n\nFor the past three years, Columbus attorney Charley Hess has been fighting Three-C\u2019s court battles. He said Thursday that his client had not yet decided whether to appeal the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision to the Ohio Supreme Court. He said he did try to take the two losses against Nationwide to the Supreme Court, but the justices refused to review the appellate court decisions.\n\nHess said he and his clients haven\u2019t given up fighting underpayments by insurers even if the latest case isn\u2019t appealed.\n\nHe said Three-C has invested heavily in scanning equipment that automobile manufacturers insist be used or they won\u2019t honor vehicle warranties. Insurers won\u2019t pay repair bills that support the use of that expensive equipment. As long as carriers underpay, policyholders end up picking up the cost, he said.\n\nThe unjust enrichment argument didn\u2019t fly in the case against Liberty Mutual, but Hess said there are still other circumstances where the argument may prove persuasive, and his clients intend to continue litigating until the courts provide some forum where body shops\u2019 arguments that insurers are paying unfair rates can be heard.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this for 20 to 30 years,\u201d Hess said. \u201cThey really want to make some inroads, not only for themselves, but for the customers.\u201d"}}
