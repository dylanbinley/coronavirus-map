Ron DeSantis has asked the Florida Legislature for $25 million to respond to novel coronavirus for supplies and personnel in the event of a surge of cases, he said Friday in Naples.\n\nOut of more than $8.3 billion in federal funding that Congress approved and President Trump signed Friday, the state should get a sizable amount.\n\n\u201cWe think we will get a minimum of $27 million, probably more from the federal government,\u201d he said during a media briefing.\n\nCoronavirus updates:Florida-related cases creep higher while the state waits for testing kits\n\nTracking the coronavirus:A look at existing cases\n\nThe state was notified Thursday it will also receive $500,000 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for immediate response.\n\nDeSantis said he is scheduled to meet Saturday with Vice President Mike Pence in South Florida and with officials from the cruise industry.\n\nMeanwhile, nobody in the last 24 hours has tested positive, and results are pending on a few dozen tests, he said.\n\nThere have been three Florida residents and one non-resident in the state who have tested positive, according to the state Department of Health website. Another five positive cases involved people brought back to the U.S. who tested positive and live in Florida.\n\nThere still has not been any case of community transmission in Florida, he said.\n\n\u201cThese are isolated cases, now we obviously expect more cases to test positive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is just the nature of it.\u201d\n\nDeSantis declared a public health emergency March 1 after two residents tested positive for COVID-19: a Manatee County man in his 60s and a woman from Hillsborough County in her 20s.\n\nHospitals on alert:Southwest Florida hospitals say they are prepared to treat coronavirus\n\nHow are nursing homes preparing?:Florida nursing homes on high alert for novel coronavirus for vulnerable residents\n\nThe governor announced a third case Tuesday, the sister of the Hillsborough woman who had recently returned from northern Italy, one of the countries with high transmission.\n\nFive hospital workers in Sarasota who had contact with a Manatee County man who was positive for COVID-19 have tested negative. The man from Manatee is now home and self isolating.\n\nAs of late Friday, the state is waiting on test results for 51 people and monitoring 264 individuals, according to the Florida Department of Health website. So far 941 people have been monitored.\n\nPeople who are being monitored include those at risk of being exposed to COVID-19.\n\nThe state is asking anyone who has traveled to China, South Korea, Italy or Iran in the last 14 days to self isolate and call their local health department if they become sick during that time.\n\nOverall, the state is still at low risk for COVID-19, yet the elderly and people with underlying medical conditions are most at risk, he said.\n\nThe NCH Healthcare System in Collier referred two patients for testing and there have been no confirmed cases, according to NCH spokesman Shawn McConnell.\n\nThe state has directed nursing homes and long-term care facilities to restrict people with illness symptoms from entering their buildings.\n\nSo far, there has not been a shortage of testing kits and DeSantis said he expects a batch coming in shortly.\n\n\u201cWe have not been overwhelmed with requests for tests,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, the testing capacity is being met.\u201d\n\nDeSantis said private laboratories run by LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics are due to start testing shortly, he said.\n\n\u201cHaving the private sector involved will help with capacity,\u201d he said.\n\nMedicaid and Medicare will cover testing, and for anybody uninsured or whose private plan does not cover it, the state Department of Health will cover it for people who meet testing guidelines by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHe emphasized frequent hand washing is important and for workers to stay home and self isolate if they are sick. In the long run economically that is better for employers.\n\n\u201cI think most employers have understood that,\u201d he said.\n\nMore:Coronavirus in Florida: How are local first responders preparing?\n\nWhen asked about community events being cancelled, which has happened in Miami, the governor said those are decisions to be made at the community level. He will not second guess that, and there has not been any guidance from the CDC.\n\n\u201cThe risk does remain low,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso on Friday, AARP Florida called on the state Legislature to cover testing costs for uninsured residents aged 50 to 64 and frontline healthcare workers in hospitals and long-term care facilities.\n\nJeff Johnson, state director for AARP Florida, said it is critical uninsured adults and healthcare workers tested.\n\n\u201cAdditional testing can give Florida\u2019s public health professionals their best chance at containing coronavirus and keeping its impact on our state limited,\u201d Johnson said in a news release."}}
