He will replace Elizabeth Graddy, who has served as interim provost since July 1.\n\nZukoski worked at UB as both provost and executive vice president for academic affairs. Before then, he served as vice chancellor for research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\n\u201c[These experiences] exposed me to these questions about how to educate students, how to hire faculty, how to enroll students, how to make sure they are retained and are successful in getting their degrees, how educational programs begin to evolve as they face the future and the altering economy and the geopolitics of the world,\u201d Zukoski said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.\n\nAs provost, Zukoski will oversee all 23 professional schools. His responsibilities will focus on admissions and enrollment services, budgeting, campus well-being and academic and faculty affairs, among others. According to Folt, Graddy will assist with Zukoski\u2019s transition as she resumes her role as executive vice provost.\n\nZukoski said his goals for the next year are three-fold: building trust and understanding the students and faculty and stakeholders at USC, strengthening the University\u2019s educational and research programs and increasing the impact USC has on its neighboring community in South L.A.\n\n\u201c[We want] to begin to address the large problems the neighborhoods face from health disparities to sustainability and water to access to food and housing,\u201d Zukoski added. \u201cHow can USC, with its research and scholarship capacity, have an enhanced impact there?\u201d\n\nZukoski said though his plans with Folt are in the preliminary stages, he aims to help move the University forward with the rest of the administration. According to Zukoski, working with the administration, faculty, students and staff on issues at USC is what attracted him to assume his position.\n\n\u201cI see an institution with a tremendous tradition, tremendous history \u2026 and then I see these issues, and I say, \u2018OK, we\u2019ve got to work on them,\u2019\u201d Zukoski said. \u201cUnderstanding how those issues came to be and what we need to put in place to make sure all those problems don\u2019t reemerge is very important but as important is reestablishing bringing everyone together so we all know we want to move forward because we have these common goals.\u201d\n\nZukoski\u2019s time at UB was marked by growth and recognition. University at Buffalo received its highest rankings from U.S. News and World Report during his tenure. It has been named among the top 50 schools in the country every year since 2013. The university received its highest ranking from the publication in 2018 when it was ranked No. 38.\n\nZukoski also helped with efforts to restructure University at Buffalo\u2019s general education program, improve graduation rates and increase and diversify the student body.\n\nDespite his successes at UB, Zukoski\u2019s time at UB was also marked with controversy. UB\u2019s student newspaper The Spectrum reported that some community members protested against wages for teaching assistants and graduate assistants at UB and petitioned for a $21,310 minimum stipend. In September 2017, Zukoski addressed a crowd of about 100 protesters and said, \u201cIt is difficult for me to reach in at the provost level and just say, pay them more,\u201d The Spectrum reported.\n\nStudent leaders later met with Zukoski and administrators at a private meeting, where he said graduate and teaching assistants made well above a living wage, the newspaper reported.\n\nZukoski earned his bachelor\u2019s in physics from Reed College in 1977 and his doctorate in chemical engineering from Princeton University in 1985.\n\nZukoski was chosen by a 17-member search committee chaired by professor Mark Humayun, which included faculty, staff, students and members of the Board of Trustees\u2019 Academic Affairs Committee, Folt wrote.\n\nUndergraduate Student Government President Trenton Stone said the provost search process was an improvement from the presidential search committee, which didn\u2019t include student input.\n\nHe was able to review applications and voice his and other undergraduate students\u2019 opinions at meetings he attended in-person and over phone call throughout the summer. In the future, Stone said he\u2019d also like to see more student voices on these committees.\n\n\u201cGiven there\u2019s a number of faculty on the committee, and the provost is the chief academic on this campus, I do think it would be helpful to have just one more undergrad and graduate at least \u2026 just to make sure that it\u2019s not just one undergraduate perspective there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt never hurts to have another.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Folt wrote she expects Zukoski\u2019s experience will provide a new perspective for the University.\n\n\u201cIn Dr. Zukoski, we have found an active partner to help advance the University by building on our breadth and depth and seeking new opportunities for impact and leadership,\u201d Folt wrote. \u201cHe is knowledgeable about all aspects of the university and cares deeply about the welfare and needs of the faculty, staff and students and the communities we serve.\u201d"}}
