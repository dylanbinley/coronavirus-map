He also tried to downplay his own words as spelled out in a partial transcript of a call with Ukraine\u2019s new leader released earlier in the day that sent shockwaves through Washington.\n\nRather than telling a CNBC reporter why his July conversation with Volodymyr Zelenskiy was indeed legal, Trump fired off a number of allegations and insults about his Democratic opponents.\n\n\u201cImpeachment for that?\u201d Trump said at one point, his voice rising. \u201cWhen you have a wonderful meeting \u2026 or call? \u2026 It was beautiful conversation.\u201d\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and presidential candidates, however, disagree. They see a potential criminal act because Trump appears to be asking a foreign government to give him a personal political benefit \u2014 that\u2019s a federal offense."}}
