The British Museum purchased the sculptures about 200 years ago from Lord Elgin, who was serving as the first British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. Supporters of Elgin claim that he removed the friezes from the at the acropolis with permission from the Ottoman Sultan. Greece, on the other hand, argues that the Ottoman empire was an occupying force and any permission granted during that period is not valid.\n\nIn 2013, UNESCO offered the British Museum to mediate a deal between it and the government of Greece, which has been calling for the return of the marbles with for the past 30 years. But the museum has reportedly rejected the request.\n\nLast year, British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn announced that if elected, he would return the friezes to Greece. \u201cThey were made in Greece, and that is where they were for thousands of years until they were taken by Lord Elgin,\u201d he told the Greek newspaper told Ta Nea. \u201cWe should be engaged in constructive talks with the Greek government about returning the sculptures.\u201d"}}
