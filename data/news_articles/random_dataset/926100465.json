A new inspection station for imported plants, funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is also planned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2019, the Otay Mesa port of entry processed $18 billion worth of exports from the U.S. to Mexico, $34 billion worth of imports, and processed one million trucks, 6.6 million vehicles and 3.6 million pedestrians, according to GSA.\n\n\u201cThese improvements will allow CBP to continue protecting our nation\u2019s borders while facilitating the trade and flow of commerce between the United States and Mexico,\u201d said Pete Flores, U.S. Customs and Border Protection director of field operations in San Diego.\n\nAlejandra Mier y Ter\u00e1n, Otay Mesa Chamber of Commerce executive director, said the project will fuel trade and economic growth by reducing wait times.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely important because we had basically reached our capacity,\"said Mier y Ter\u00e1n.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe completion of the new and expanded facilities could coincide with the opening of a second passenger border crossing in Otay Mesa, scheduled for 2023.\n\nIn late 2019, the U.S. government completed an $800-million expansion project at the San Ysidro port of entry, which is among the busiest in the world.\n\nSan Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer welcomed the federal investment in Otay Mesa. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen firsthand the positive impact of the recently completed expansion of the San Ysidro Land Port of Entry,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re looking to grow this economic engine even more by increasing processing capacity at the Otay Mesa port of entry.\u201d"}}
