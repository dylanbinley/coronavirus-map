But Wheeler said the federal presence in the city is now exacerbating a tense situation and he has told them to depart.\n\n\u201cKeep your troops in your own buildings, or have them leave our city,\u201d Wheeler said Friday.\n\n3:50 George Floyd family attorney announces civil lawsuit against Minneapolis and 4 former police officers over death George Floyd family attorney announces civil lawsuit against Minneapolis and 4 former police officers over death\n\nOregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum late Friday sued Homeland Security and the Marshals Service in federal court. The complaint says that unidentified federal agents have grabbed people off Portland\u2019s streets \u201cwithout warning or explanation, without a warrant, and without providing any way to determine who is directing this action.\u201d\n\nRosenblum said she was seeking a temporary restraining order to \u201cimmediately stop federal authorities from unlawfully detaining Oregonians.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThe current escalation of fear and violence in downtown Portland is being driven by federal law enforcement tactics that are entirely unnecessary,\u201d Rosenblum said in a statement.\n\nThe administration has enlisted federal agents, including the U.S. Marshals Special Operations Group and an elite U.S. Customs and Border Protection team based on the U.S.-Mexico border, to protect federal property.\n\nBut Oregon Public Broadcasting reported this week that some agents had been driving around in unmarked vans and snatching protesters from streets not near federal property, without identifying themselves.\n\nTensions also escalated after an officer with the Marshals Service fired a less-lethal round at a protester\u2019s head on July 11, critically injuring him.\n\n2:11 New transcript reveals Derek Chauvin told George Floyd: it takes \u2018a lot of oxygen to talk\u2019 New transcript reveals Derek Chauvin told George Floyd: it takes \u2018a lot of oxygen to talk\u2019\n\nOn Friday night, hundreds of people gathered for a vigil outside the downtown Justice Center, which is sandwiched between two federal buildings, including a courthouse, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. Across the street, dozens of other protesters entered two recently closed city parks after dismantling chain-link fencing that blocked access.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nFederal agents emerged from an office building next door and used impact munitions, stun grenades and tear gas to clear the area, the news organization reported. It said its journalists did not observe any incident that might have prompted the use of the weapons.\n\nFederal officers deployed tear gas again just before midnight after a few protesters placed dismantled fencing in front of plywood doors covering the entrance of the federal courthouse.\n\nEarly Saturday, Portland police declared the gathering unlawful, saying protesters had piled fencing in front of the exits to the federal courthouse and the Multnomah County Justice Center and then shot off fireworks at the Justice Center.\n\nFederal officers and local police then advanced simultaneously on the demonstrators to clear the streets, making arrests as protesters threw bottles and pieces of metal fence at police, the Portland Police Bureau said. Portland Police Chief Chuck Lovell told reporters Friday that his officers are in contact with the federal agents, but that neither controls the others\u2019 actions.\n\n1:17 Police clear Seattle\u2019s organized protest zone Police clear Seattle\u2019s organized protest zone\n\nThe overnight action by Portland\u2019s police was condemned by a prominent member of the City Council. On Saturday Jo Ann Hardesty said local police \u201cjoined in the aggressive clampdown of peaceful protest.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHardesty, who said she was downtown speaking at the protest Friday night, slammed Wheeler, telling the mayor he needed to better control local law enforcement. Hardesty, who oversees the city\u2019s fire department and other first-responder agencies, said in an open letter to Wheeler if \u201cyou can\u2019t control the police, give me the Portland Police Bureau.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Portland Police said as they responded to the overnight protests \u2014 which included people throwing projectiles at them \u2014 some federal agencies took action \u201cunder their own supervision and direction.\u201d\n\nPortland Police said city officers arrested seven people, and one officer sustained a minor injury.\n\nThe statement said the city\u2019s police supports peaceful protests, and beginning Saturday night Department of Homeland Security police won\u2019t work in the Portland Police incident command centre."}}
