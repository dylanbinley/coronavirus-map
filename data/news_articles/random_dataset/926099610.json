The country continues to fight inherent traditional socio-economic challenges and now Covid-19 has come on board. Social dialogue is necessary to enhance collective effort in responding to the effects of any catastrophe.\n\n\u201cIndigenous knowledge systems, home grown solutions, research and development must be supported.\n\n\u201cWe must encourage and incentivise innovation and creativity in all aspects of the Zimbabwean life. These aspects include healthcare, value addition of national primary goods, technology, agro-processing and mineral beneficiation, among others.\n\n\u201cThere are opportunities created by this pandemic and we stand uniquely positioned to develop our own homegrown exploits in a number of sectors. Covid-19 exposed businesses as we had to close shop, yet employees were being paid.\n\n\u201cOur industrial structure is not yet configured to support working from home. The pandemic provided a wake-up call for businesses to redesign their operations, restructure and embrace utilisation of available technologies to reduce the cost of products and services,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Binha added: \u201cBusinesses have to deduce mechanisms to recover from this pandemic. I am sure a rescue package given by the State, coupled by tax holidays and debt forgiveness, may shorten the period in which industry will be in distress.\n\nBorders are closed in most traditional markets. Local markets are the new normal and we have to create local demand for some products.\u201d\n\nRusape rising entrepreneur, Mr Peter Muchirahondo, said Covid-19 is an eye-opener that requires new thinking.\n\n\u201cJust like any businessman, I had set smart and ambitious goals for this year. As a young entrepreneur who faces challenges, especially on the markets and on accessing operational capital, I had set my eyes on an international programme \u2014 the 15th CII-EXIM Bank Conclave on India/Africa Project \u2013 to introduce my company, Mastrade Investments, to top Indian companies and investors.\n\n\u201cI wanted to seek partnerships in the Information Communication Technologies, pharmaceutical and agricultural sectors. When everything appeared ready, the trip was cancelled due to Covid-19. After the abrupt cancellation of the lucrative programme, I had to go back to the drawing board and craft strategies that will see my company remaining afloat.\n\n\u201cI had to employ new tactics, especially the use of online platforms to market my products. I actually clinched one of my biggest contracts during the lockdown.\n\n\u201cWhile l was thinking of importing finished products from India, I am now working on exporting Zimbabwean products to them,\u201d said Mr Muchirahondo."}}
