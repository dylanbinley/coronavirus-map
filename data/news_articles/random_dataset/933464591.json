I am just a normal minister who takes care of the rakyat and the security and safety of the country,\u201d he said in response when asked about Azmin\u2019s claim.\n\nAzmin yesterday had said that snap polls could be called this year or next year, adding it was due for PN to face a general election for its handling of the public health crises, politics and the economy.\n\nHamzah, who is also Parti Pribumi Bersatu Bersatu secretary-general, repeatedly denied knowledge of snap polls when pressed.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask this question to the minister who brought up this issue? What did he say?\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, I don\u2019t know because I am not a senior minister. Maybe this is only between the senior ministers and the prime minister,\u201d he said, referring to such a discussion.\n\n\u201cWhether elections will be held soon or further in the future is not my main agenda.\n\n\u201cMy main agenda is for the rakyat to be confident in the leadership of Muhyiddin as prime minister and for the PN government to have cooperation that is stronger than the previous government,\u201d he said, referring to Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin.\n\nThis as talks of snap polls being called intensified as the next Parliament sitting approaches, with the Opposition raring to table a no-confidence movement against Muhyiddin to oust what has been labeled a \u2018backdoor government\u2019 by critics.\n\nSeparate reports claimed that Muhyiddin himself has been considering calling for elections to legitimise his position as the government\u2019s leader following his handling of the political impasse, and the Covid-19 pandemic along with its economic uncertainties.\n\n\n\n"}}
