It\u2019s estimated about 100 people are buried beneath the unengraved fieldstones, their names \u201cknown only to God.\u201d\n\nThe service was particularly meaningful to one of those who attended. Denise Cumbee Long learned fairly recently that she is descended from an early slave family.\n\n\u201cOne of my direct paternal ancestors was either part of that original group or a child of one of the original \u201820 and odd\u2019 Africans brought to the port in 1619,\u201d she said. In an email she described research she and her father have done and documentation from author Tim Hashaw in \u201cThe Birth of Black America: The First African Americans and the Pursuit of Freedom at Jamestown.\u201d\n\nWhen Long\u2019s father sent his DNA sample to a testing service, the results showed ancestry from sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cThe African Cumbo family first appeared in Jamestown documents in September 1644 and they, too, survived and traveled far from the colony over many generations,\u201d said Long, who is ordained in the United Church of Christ and is currently executive director of the Henderson County United Way.\n\nThe ancestor, Emanuell Cambow (Cumbo), was freed was freed in September 1665 and two years later granted fifty acres in James City County. \u201cIn the papers that recorded the land patent, Cambow was described as a Negro,\u201d Long said. \u201cSeveral clues indicate that Manuel Cambow was a Bantu from Angola. First, Cambo (possibly derived from Kambol, a royal name of Ndongo) was an African with a Christian Portuguese name who appeared in Jamestown between 1619 and 1650, when West India Company records show that virtually all of the three hundred or so Africans in Jamestown were being brought to the colony by Protestant pirates raiding Portuguese and Spanish slave ships sailing from Luanda, Angola.\u201d\n\nAfter Long connected with other Cumbo descendants several years ago, she and her husband, Bruce Holliday, joined the family at a reunion in Williamsburg in 2016.\n\nThe commemoration at St. John in the Wilderness, which was joined by representatives from the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site, was one of many events by national parks and communities to mark the landing of the first enslaved Africans on Aug. 25, 1619. Bells rang for four minutes, a minute for each century that has passed since that day.\n\n\n\n"}}
