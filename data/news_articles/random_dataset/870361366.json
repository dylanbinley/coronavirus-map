Following the global trend, the Vietnamese government aims to turn AI into a driving force of development and make it a top priority in growth policies.\n\nOne of the most important tasks is developing human resources, including improving higher education training quality, building 4.0 technology training institutes, encouraging technological application, renovation at businesses; and investment in science-technology research.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to Minister of Science and Technology Chu Ng\u1ecdc Anh Vi\u1ec7t Nam has advantages in start-up innovation and technological development, especially in AI. With an open business climate and labour force interested in technology, the application of AI in various sectors has made progress, connecting parts of the nation\u2019s AI ecosystem.\n\nIn Vi\u1ec7t Nam, AI has been applied in a number of sectors including healthcare, education, agriculture, transport and e-commerce.\n\nThe information-telecommunication-technology group FPT Corporation has applied AI in smart traffic in HCM City.\n\nViettel Military Industry and Telecoms Group is the first business in Vi\u1ec7t Nam to apply AI in endoscopy, helping identify, localise and assess levels of damage in the digestive system.\n\n\u201cAI reduces diagnosis time by five times compared to traditional methods with accuracy of up to 90 per cent,\u201d Nguy\u1ec5n Quang Vinh from Viettel Business Solutions Corporation said.\n\nIn the agricultural and forestry sector, Viettel has applied AI in forest status and area statistics with accuracy of 80 per cent. The firm is looking to set up forest databases and management maps.\n\nViettel has also come up with a solution to help businesses fight cyberattacks and tighten internal security.\n\nAccording to Deputy Prime Minister V\u0169 \u0110\u1ee9c \u0110am AI aims to make society safe and civilized. Projects like smart cities, traveling assistance, security control and information security are all to serve the country.\n\n\u201cAI offers opportunities for Vi\u1ec7t Nam to make breakthroughs and push the country forward,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAI ecosystem\n\nMinister of Planning and Investment Nguy\u1ec5n Ch\u00ed D\u0169ng said the ministry had set up a digital ecosystem for innovation and start-ups. The ministry had proposed to the Prime Minister a national innovation centre which supports technological breakthroughs and creative ideas of Vietnamese entrepreneurs.\n\nThe Ministry of Planning and Investment and Ministry of Science and Technology would accompany the AI community to help them address challenges in the process of studying and developing AI in Vi\u1ec7t Nam.\n\nThe Ministry of Planning and Investment had created favorable conditions to attract domestic and international investment in AI. At the Vietnam Venture Summit in June this year, 18 local and foreign investment funds committed investment of US$425 million for Vietnamese start-ups in the next three years.\n\nPutting human resource development at the core of the AI industry, the Vietnamese innovation network had attracted technological experts.\n\nThe Ministry of Planning and Investment planned to expand the network of Vietnamese AI experts in other countries and establish a global fund to train high-quality human resources for the industry.\n\nAccording to T\u1ea1 H\u1ea3i T\u00f9ng, head of Information Technology Institute of H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i University of Science and Technology the Vietnamese AI community is young and has potential to grow quickly. Three years ago, overseas Vietnamese who were experts in the technology sector started to come back to Vi\u1ec7t Nam to develop AI and help the local community interact more with international counterparts.\n\nThe Vietnamese AI community so far involves foreign investors, associations, connecting specialists with State agencies and the market.\n\nAn alliance of AI communities in Vi\u1ec7t Nam debuted last month, including the Digital Transformation community, Machine Learning community, Google Developer community and Business Intelligence community.\n\nInternational experience\n\nKyoo Sung Noh, chairman and CEO of Korea Productivity Centre, said like the Republic of Korea (RoK), AI would be the future of Vi\u1ec7t Nam. In the RoK, AI had changed the social structure, jobs, sectors and people. The Government\u2019s policies to develop AI focused on human resources to serve national industry.\n\nThe RoK had studied and set up the infrastructure for big data. AI had also had impacts on recruitment and laborers\u2019 quality classification, he said.\n\nThe level of AI application in Vi\u1ec7t Nam was high compared to the rest of Southeast Asia, as high as Singapore, he said, adding that Vi\u1ec7t Nam needed to have a long-term development strategy.\n\nAccording to Noh, in the RoK, AI is presented in products of large corporations. The Government has offered policy support for AI application to attract talents.\n\nVi\u1ec7t Nam and the Rok have room to co-operate in the sector as the two countries share commonalities. Vi\u1ec7t Nam has made efforts to build smart cities. The RoK built smart cities since 2000. About 40 percent of Vietnamese people work in the agricultural sector. In spite of not having a large number of agricultural workers like Vi\u1ec7t Nam, the RoK has applied AI in agriculture. These similarities enable the RoK to share experience with Vi\u1ec7t Nam.\n\nL\u00ea H\u1ed3ng Vi\u1ec7t, director of technology at FPT Corporation, said human resources was a challenge for the corporation as the market faces a shortage of AI-trained labour. The outstanding AI experts who study overseas did not return.\n\nB\u00f9i H\u1ea3i H\u01b0ng, founding director of VinAI, the first AI research lab in Vi\u1ec7t Nam funded by VinGroup, said higher education training was the core solution to address the AI human resource shortage. \u201cVinAI targets to support universities in research and help lecturers gain interest in doing research.\u201d\n\nT\u1ea1 H\u1ea3i T\u00f9ng, from the Information Technology Institute of H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i University of Science and Technology, said this year, the university opened an AI major with an admission score of 27 out of 30 with limited admitted students.\n\nData science and AI are among four research priorities of the university. The university will step up studies and training at graduate and post-graduate levels and strengthen co-operation between schools and enterprises.\n\nRead Next\n\nEDITORS' PICK\n\nMOST READ"}}
