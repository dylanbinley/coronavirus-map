And it\u2019s now looking to a new front to extend its hard and soft power and prop up fellow authoritarian regimes: the continent of Africa.\n\nLast week, the German newspaper Bild raised alarms about Russia\u2019s growing influence in Africa, citing a classified German Foreign Ministry report that Russia has concluded agreements with six African nations to install military bases abroad, including in Egypt and Sudan.\n\nA private pro-Kremlin Russian newspaper, seeming to offer an unofficial answer, called the report false and countered that the West is merely jealous of warming trade ties.\n\nStill, Vladimir Putin has made little secret of his interest in projecting the Kremlin\u2019s influence around the world, and of making Africa a priority region for military cooperation. By forging military agreements with African countries, Russia is trying to \u201cfit\u201d the modern security system, pro-Kremlin experts say, competing with China and the United States.\n\nRussia\u2019s military return to Africa began soon after the conflict in Ukraine in 2014. Moscow signed agreements for cooperation with more than 20 countries, including Madagascar, Angola, the Central African Republic, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Algeria is the largest recipient of Russian armaments in Africa, followed by Egypt, Sudan, and Angola. Many of these countries cooperated with the Soviet Union for decades. Soviet military surveillance planes, such as the Tu-95s and Tu-142s, used Luanda, the Angolan capital, as a base from which they could comb the Southern Atlantic Ocean for U.S. submarines.\n\nThe Soviet Union had also teamed up with Angola\u2019s Marxist leaders and backed a Cuban military intervention in Angola that continued from 1975 to 1991, poisoning relations between Moscow and Washington on African issues.\n\nRussian independent military expert Alexander Golts believes U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s isolationist policy has encouraged the Russian moves. America\u2019s pullback, he said, makes it \u201ccomfortable\u201d for Russia to expand its activity in the Middle East and Africa.\n\n\u201cWe can see that Russian military officers work in the Central African Republic, we see how Moscow increases its military activities in adventurous campaigns in Syria and Libya, while Trump prefers to stay away,\u201d Golts told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cRepeating the practice of Soviet leaders, who for decades threatened with expansion, Russia is trying to convince the United States and especially China that it can compete in Africa. But this time, it is much more a psychological thing by Putin\u2014who\u2019s been promising Russians to get them off their knees\u2014than ideological,\u201d as was the Russian support for African communist movements.\n\nOn Sunday, Bild cited a classified report by the German Foreign Office on \u201cRussia\u2019s new Africa ambitions.\u201d It said the Kremlin had \u201ccontractually assured that it would build military bases in six states: the Central African Republic, Egypt, Eritrea, Madagascar, Mozambique and Sudan.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper explained that African dictatorial regimes already use Russian mercenaries to gain or remain in power: \u201cRussia, just like China, does not link its aid to questions of the rule of law\u201d in the autocratic states on the continent, the report says. \u201cIn the secret paper, the Foreign Office analysts do not mince words: the capabilities of Russia\u2019s armed forces and mercenaries are \u2018of great interest to autocratic regimes in possible operations against their own people,\u2019\u201d the newspaper reported.\n\nIn response, the Russian newspaper Arguments of the Week immediately countered: \u201cBerlin is afraid that Russia will occupy Africa.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur country has a big part of the market on the Dark Continent,\u201d the newspaper wrote, using a derogatory phrase for Africa, even in Russian. \u201cBerlin is concerned that Russia can strengthen its position on the international arena, receiving Africa\u2019s support for its policy at the United Nations.\u201d\n\nIndeed, last year Russia teamed up with African members of the U.N. Security Council to block statements regarding a coup in Sudan. \u201cRussia has cultivated authoritarian regimes in Africa as potential allies in blocking international efforts to promote human rights and democratic governance through U.N.-affiliated organizations and agencies,\u201d the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace warned.\n\nAdditionally, Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry said two years ago, in March 2018, that at least 175 Russian military experts and instructors traveled to the Central African Republic to train local soldiers. Still, \u201cit is one thing to train soldiers and sell weapons and a completely different thing to build military bases. That would require approval by the Russian parliament; besides, I cannot imagine Russia building a military base in Egypt,\u201d where the United States already has close military cooperation with the country, Golts, the independent military expert, told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cI think that the report published by Bild was a compilation of all the open sources that we have already heard about.\u201d\n\nAfter nearly a decade of absence in Africa, the Kremlin announced its full-scale return last year. Putin received more than 10,000 delegates from 54 African states at his summer residence in the resort city of Sochi for a conference on Russia and Africa. In meetings with leaders of dozens of African states, Putin toasted $12.5 billion worth of deals for building nuclear plants, selling missile defense systems and military jets: \u201cLet\u2019s drink to the success of our joint efforts to develop full-scale mutually beneficial cooperation, well-being, peaceful future and prosperity of our countries and people,\u201d he proclaimed.\n\nAt the summit, Russian officials promised to expand joint cooperation between Russian and African special services, exchange information, and continue training soldiers in African states.\n\nAfter Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in March 2014, and the war in Eastern Ukraine, Moscow actively looked southwards for new bases, building one in Syria\u2019s Latakia for the Russian air force and re-enforcing a Mediterranean naval base at Tartus, which Russia has held since Soviet times. The bases in Africa appear to be the next step in global expansion.\n\n\u201cA few new Russian bases in Africa would be nothing compared to thousands of the U.S. military bases, which are like a net covering our entire planet,\u201d Yuriy Krupnov, a pro-Kremlin geopolitical analyst, told The Daily Beast. \u201cRussia has around 100 various projects around the strategically important continent of Africa, with [its] population of one billion people, with Russia-educated experts in nearly every country; but compared to China\u2019s more than $60 billion investments, Russia\u2019s hardly developing any infrastructure,\u201d Krupnov added.\n\nRussia\u2019s military comeback in Africa partners the country with a list of states notorious for violating human rights, suggesting an alternative source of military and secret service expertise for governments that fall from favor with Western Europe or the United States. Compared to China\u2019s investments in Africa, Russia\u2019s financial outlays are tiny. But as an exercise in extending influence, Russia\u2019s moves in Africa are now undeniable. Says the pro-Kremlin analyst Krupnov: \u201cOur return is just an effort to fit into the modern security system.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nVideo: U.S. intelligence warns of election interference by China, Russia and Iran (CNBC)"}}
