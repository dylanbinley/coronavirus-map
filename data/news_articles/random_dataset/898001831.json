Thus, geography/land/soil cannot be used as a lame excuse to deny them basic amenities such as lifts\u201d.\n\nWorking with the residents and speaking to them during walkabouts, Mr Lim wrote, \u201c2 elderly residents shared that they had sustained injuries on their nose bridge & knee after falling from the staircases. It sets us wondering if HDB will seriously address this issue only after more injuries or worse have been sustained\u201d.\n\nHe added, \u201cSome of the residents told us they had resigned themselves to fate. They shared that they were sick & tired of the patronizing answers given by the authorities & incumbent\u201d.\n\nThis has been an ongoing issue, as in an earlier Facebook post, Mr Lim shared how he was in talks with the same issue that was faced by residents of Block 115 of Marsiling Rise.\n\nHe wrote, \u201cSo many residents whom I spoke to could not understand why they were excluded from this National Programme (LUP). They felt that they were \u201cpenalized\u201d for purchasing these jumbo flats which were built to house four generations (4G).\u201d /TISG"}}
