A new reality television show called Popstars, a joint Seven Network/Warner Music production with Jackie \u201cJackie O\u201d Henderson among the judges.\n\nOne of the first reality TV talent shows in the country, Popstars was an instant hit, hooking an average of 2.6 million viewers; by the time it finished its run, public interest in the girl group it produced \u2013 comprised of Katie Underwood, Tiffani Wood, Belinda Chapple, Sally Polihronas and a pre-fame Sophie Monk \u2013 was at fever pitch.\n\nA scandal that saw original member Chantelle Barry kicked out and replaced by Wood only added to the hype, and suddenly the five members had gone from unknowns to fully fledged pop stars in a matter of weeks.\n\nmedia_camera Bardot on the red carpet at the 2000 Aria Awards in Sydney.

(Picture: Mick Tsikas)\n\nAs Underwood recalls that heady period, she tells Stellar, \u201cThat was probably the strangest thing in my life. I had trouble going anywhere because it was so intense, especially for me and Sophie because we were very spottable.\n\n\u201cThe media maintained that the hype was unjustified because at, that point in time, we hadn\u2019t done anything \u2013 we\u2019d just been on TV.\u201d\n\nThat was quickly rectified when Bardot\u2019s first single \u2018Poison\u2019 was released in April 2000 and debuted at number one on the ARIA charts; a self-titled debut album followed a few weeks later. Fans couldn\u2019t get enough, with thousands piling into shopping malls across the country to see the girls perform.\n\n\u201cThe screaming was echoing through the walls,\u201d Chapple recalls. \u201cI was just so dumbfounded and overwhelmed by it all that it was hard to sing and dance.\u201d\n\nFans were as fanatical about the band\u2019s fashion as they were about the music and a self-titled clothing label was born so girls could dress like their idols in leather, snakeskin print, scarf tops, asymmetrical dresses and Wood\u2019s signature cowgirl hat.\n\nmedia_camera Bardot performing at a shopping centre in Perth. (Picture: Ross Swanbprpugh)\n\nUnderwood wasn\u2019t so keen on that aspect of the job. \u201cI never wanted to be a model,\u201d she explains. \u201cI remember being angry at certain times because we spent more time in photo shoots than we did singing. When you sign up to be a female pop star, it\u2019s implicit you\u2019re also signing up to be a make-up, hair and fashion model.\u201d\n\nThe band spent two years travelling the world and performing to packed arenas, but success abated just as quickly as it had arrived. Underwood was the first to break away when she left after a year to pursue a career in musical theatre.\n\nThe remaining four released a second album in November 2001, but by the following April \u2013 two years on from \u2018Poison\u2019 \u2013 an official statement announced their disbandment as a \u201cmutual decision\u201d.\n\nRumours persisted Monk\u2019s desire to embark on a solo career was the catalyst, which she denied at the time, and which Polihronas seemed to quell a couple of years later during an interview.\n\nmedia_camera \u201cI remember being angry at certain times because we spent more time in photo shoots than we did singing.\u201d (Picture: Pip Blackwood)\n\n\u201cWhen Sophie went solo, everyone assumed that it was she who broke up the band, which wasn\u2019t right,\u201d she claimed. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I should say this, but I wanted out for a long time.\u201d\n\nWhatever the reason, Chapple and Wood maintain they were blindsided by the break-up. Chapple tells Stellar, \u201cIt happened very suddenly and most of us had no idea it was coming. We were all made to sign a release to say we were tired, and some of us were tired, but most were fine. Looking back now, I would have never signed that, but I was young and put on the spot.\u201d\n\nWood agrees, \u201cI was devastated! All I ever dreamed of was to be in a girl band, and to think I actually got it and two years later it was taken away from me. Out of the blue came the announcement that Sophie didn\u2019t want to be in the band anymore and that\u2019s when the whole she-said-she-said came about. Every girl will tell you something different about how it ended.\u201d\n\nMonk\u2019s solo career didn\u2019t last long, but she found success as an actor, radio host and TV personality.\n\nmedia_camera \u201cI was devastated!

Fame really is so fickle.\u201d\n\nmedia_camera Bardot features in this Sunday\u2019s Stellar.\n\nTalk of a reunion comes up from time to time. Die-hard fans who follow the women on social media will have noticed an official Instagram account has been created, with Wood, Chapple and Underwood keen to reconnect with their fans and reminisce about Bardot\u2019s heyday.\n\nWhen Stellar asks if a reunion is in fact in the works, Wood elaborates.\n\n\u201cWe all got on [a call], except for Sophie, and had a chat. It went so well that we were close to doing something, but old wounds opened up and people\u2019s lives are busy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard Sophie say \u2018never say never\u2019, but she\u2019s never said yes \u2013 or maybe she\u2019s said no every time, which is fair enough. She\u2019s doing her own thing. But we all have our own reasons, and it\u2019s not going ahead.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, she keeps the door open \u2013 and offers a suggestion. \u201cMaybe when we\u2019re 50, we can give it another shot...\u201d\n\nREAD MORE EXCLUSIVES FROM STELLAR."}}
