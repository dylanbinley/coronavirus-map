He also said the changes would save tens of millions of dollars.\n\nThere are 94 facilities in New Jersey affected by the rules, according to Grewal\u2019s office. They include chemical manufacturing plants and petroleum facilities.\n\nThe suit was filed Wednesday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for Washington D.C. Fifteen attorneys general are part of the complaint, including Pennsylvania and New York.\n\nA spokeswoman for the EPA did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nBlake Nelson can be reached at bnelson@njadvancemedia.com.
