In Blackpool there are 551 cases while in Blackburn with Darwen the total has risen to 391.\n\nLancashire hospitals have recorded four new coronavirus deaths, according to the latest NHS figures.\n\nTwo deaths were recorded at East Lancashire Hospitals, including one on May 17 and one on May 16. The trust has so far recorded 170 deaths.\n\nUniversity Hospitals of Morecambe Bay recorded one death on May 15 taking its total to 158 and Blackpool Teaching Hospitals also registered one death on May 18, which now has recorded 163 deaths.\n\nLancashire Teaching Hospitals, which includes Preston and Chorley, and Southport and Ormskirk hospitals both recorded no new deaths. Their death tolls stand at 175 and 131 respectively.\n\nIt means Lancashire's death toll has reached 797.\n\nAcross the UK, there have so far been 2,772,552 tests.\n\nOf those, 248,818 people have tested positive.\n\nThe UK death toll has now reached 35,341.\n\nThese latest figures come as new doubt has been cast over the reopening of schools next month.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSchools should reopen \u201cas soon as it is safe to do so\u201d, the British Medical Association has said, despite ministers facing pressure to reconsider plans for some pupils to return to the classroom next month.\n\nThe BMA\u2019s public health medicine committee chairman Dr Peter English said there was \u201cgrowing evidence\u201d that the risk to children from coronavirus is \u201cextremely small\u201d \u2013 but cautioned there is \u201cno united view yet\u201d on whether children can spread it.\n\nThe doctors\u2019 union previously said the Government should not consider reopening schools in England until the case numbers are \u201cmuch lower\u201d.\n\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph, Dr English said: \u201cThe decision about when schools should be allowed to reopen is an extremely difficult one.\n\n\u201cWe know that the longer children are kept away from the classroom, the greater the harm to their education, life opportunities and wellbeing.\n\n\u201cFor disadvantaged children, this harm is even greater. A focus on arbitrary dates for schools to reopen is polarising.\n\n\u201cThe BMA wants schools to reopen as soon as it is safe to do so and the evidence allows \u2013 this could be before June 1 or after. But a zero-risk approach is not possible. This is about \u2018safe\u2019 being an acceptable level of risk.\u201d\n\nA number of councils have advised their schools against reopening more widely to Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 pupils from June 1 amid safety concerns.\n\nThe chief executive of the National Governance Association, Emma Knights, told BBC News that governing boards would have to \u201cthink very carefully\u201d before disregarding the advice of local authorities\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cIf they were to do that they would have to have very good reasons why they had come to a different conclusion.\u201d\n\nThe comment came as a poll from teachers\u2019 union NASUWT suggested that only 5% of teachers think it will be safe for more pupils to return to school next month.\n\nGeneral secretary Patrick Roach said the union remains \u201cunconvinced\u201d that wider reopening of schools from June 1 is \u201cappropriate or practicable\u201d.\n\nDeputy chief scientific adviser Professor Dame Angela McLean told the daily Downing Street press conference on Tuesday that changes to the lockdown restrictions would require an effective system for tracing new cases to be in place."}}
