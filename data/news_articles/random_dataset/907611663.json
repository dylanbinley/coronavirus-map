The people of my province are suffering and need real, structural change. A line in the sand must be drawn.\u201d\n\nThe document itself outlines several issues and demands.\n\n\u201cStructural, constitutional change must happen within Confederation or a referendum on Alberta\u2019s independence is an inevitability,\u201d it reads.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cIt is not our job to explain Alberta\u2019s value, it is now up to Canada to show they understand Alberta and our value to Confederation.\u201d\n\n2:14 What are Albertans saying about Wexit? What are Albertans saying about Wexit?\n\nLydia Miljan, a University of Windsor political science professor, said that the declaration is likely an attempt to get Canadians talking about the problems facing Alberta.\n\n\u201cI think Albertans have learned through our long history that when a province complains, when a province demands a different agreement with the federal government, it tends to get something,\u201d Miljan said.\n\n\u201cIt may not get all of its demands, but it certainly gets a lot of attention.\u201d\n\nMiljan noted that the declaration pointed to largely deeper problems within Canada\u2019s makeup, rather than a specific government.\n\n\u201cHistorically, it\u2019s been Ontario and Quebec that have called the shots, and the periphery, they\u2019ve had much more difficulty getting their culture and their way of life recognized,\u201d she said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re essentially saying, \u2018if Quebec gets to call the shots on say immigration and cultural policy, why can\u2019t other parts of the country?'\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Western frustration fuels Wexit separatist movement\n\nThat\u2019s why Miljan said she believes a referendum on separation would have strong support in Alberta and Western Canada in general, despite being \u201cvery divisive\u201d across the country.\n\nBut separation is not an easy process, Christo Aivalis, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of history at University of Toronto, told Global News following the October 2019 election.\n\n\u201cSeparating is not an easy process, it\u2019s not a quick process. It could take years and years and years to figure out, and by then there could be an election where a pro-Western party, under their definition, or a pro-Western prime minister takes power. And maybe they wouldn\u2019t want to separate anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nThe process of separation is laid out in The Clarity Act, which was created in response to Quebec separatist movements.\n\nWestern alienation has been of growing concern following the October 2019 federal election, with some even floating the term \u201cWexit\u201d \u2014 Western Canada\u2019s exit from Canada.\n\nBehind the movement is a sentiment that the federal government, for years, has ignored western economic and social interests.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn December, the founder of the Wexit movement, Peter Downing, blamed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for crushing the economic growth of Alberta and Saskatchewan.\n\n3:10 Kim Campbell on Wexit and why Canada is so divided Kim Campbell on Wexit and why Canada is so divided\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never before seen a government in Ottawa so hostile to one area of the country,\u201d Downing said.\n\n\u201cWe want people here to have a high quality of life and it\u2019s only through self-determination \u2014 which can only come through separation \u2014 that we\u2019re going to achieve it. And we will achieve it.\u201d\n\nTrudeau\u2019s Liberals were entirely locked out of Alberta and Saskatchewan in the federal election. However, he has said one of his goals in the minority government is to create a more unified Canada. He has shuffled Chrystia Freeland from the foreign affairs portfolio to become deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs to take on the task.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nGlobal News reached out to Freeland\u2019s office on the Buffalo Declaration, but did not hear back by publication.\n\nThe thought of western provinces separating from Canada is a divisive one. A December 2019 Ipsos poll conducted on behalf of Global News found that 80 per cent of respondents in Alberta, and 70 per cent in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, said their provinces have legitimate beef with Ottawa.\n\nIn contrast, 47 per cent of respondents nationwide said the same.\n\nThe discrepancy in the poll could suggest the concerns of those in the Prairies just aren\u2019t resonating with Canadians elsewhere.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Canadians don\u2019t want to hear about the problems of other Canadians because they have their own,\u201d said Sean Simpson, vice president of public affairs at Ipsos.\n\n\u201cIn British Columbia, they\u2019re struggling with housing prices; in Ontario, manufacturing jobs are being lost; in Eastern Canada, they\u2019re struggling to keep their employees in Atlantic Canada and not moving to other parts of Canada or the United States.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s got their own problems and they\u2019re not feeling too sympathetic towards the Albertans and those from Saskatchewan who are crying foul.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u2014 With files from Global News reporters Amanda Connolly, Silvana Benolich"}}
