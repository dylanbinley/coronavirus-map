Tens of thousands of protesters have taken to India\u2019s streets to call for its revocation.\n\nTwenty-three people have been killed nationwide in the protests, the first major roadblock for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist agenda since his party\u2019s landslide reelection earlier this year.\n\nModi has defended the citizenship law and accused the opposition of pushing the country into a \u201cfear psychosis.\u201d\n\nSixteen of the deaths occurred in Uttar Pradesh, according to state government spokesman Awanish Awasthi. Muslims account for 20% of the state\u2019s 200 million people. The state government is controlled by Modi\u2019s governing party. Government officials have repeatedly said security forces haven\u2019t killed anyone.\n\nSecurity drones buzzed over western Uttar Pradesh as authorities sought to head off protests, which turned violent after last week\u2019s Friday prayers. Mobile internet was blocked in about a third of the state, including in parts of the capital, Lucknow, where one person was killed in a protest a week ago.\n\nElsewhere in New Delhi, security forces surrounded a rally at one of India\u2019s largest mosques, where a protest march last Friday ended in violence after a car was set on fire in front of a police station.\n\nIn Mumbai, India\u2019s financial capital, authorities denied protesters permission to conduct a 3.7-mile march."}}
