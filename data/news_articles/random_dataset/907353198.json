There were no other immediate reports of shots being fired.\n\nMore demonstrators gathered in different locations in the capital later in the day, many chanting slogans against Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, head of Sudan\u2019s sovereign council, accusing him of having too much control over the military.\n\nThey chanted: \u201cThe military belongs to Sudan, not Burhan!\u201d\n\nThe Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which called the protest and was also a key member of the opposition coalition that struck the deal with the military, called for the interior minister and the police director general to be sacked.\n\nIt urged Prime Minister Abdulla Hamdok to replace the officials with \u201cnational elements who belong to the revolution\u201d.\n\nThe SPA said in a statement earlier in the day that all soldiers and military officers who had been \u201carbitrarily excluded from military service\u201d should be reinstated.\n\nThe military removed Bashir from office and arrested him last April after months of demonstrations, bringing an end to his 30 years of autocratic rule.\n\nBut dozens of protesters were killed during crackdowns on the demonstrations, and dozens more died last June when security forces cleared a sit-in at which protesters pushed for further reforms.\n\nMohamed Seddik, an iconic figure of the uprising, is among those dismissed last week and one of several young army officers who had refused to participate in the crackdown on demonstrations in front of the defence ministry calling for the removal of Bashir.\n\n\u201cWhoever protected and sided with the people\u2019s revolution deserves to be celebrated, promoted and given a leadership position,\u201d the SPA said in its statement."}}
