He said the U.S. would be reviewing the WHO's actions to stop the virus before making any decision on resuming aid.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Geneva-based organization on Trump's announcement. But when asked about possible U.S. funding cuts during a regular U.N. briefing earlier Tuesday, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris responded, \u201cRegardless of any issues, our work will go on.\u201d\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres responded to Trump\u2019s announcement by saying now is not the time to end support for the World Health Organization, calling the WHO \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d to the global effort to combat COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nGuterres said that it is possible that different entities read the facts differently but that the appropriate time for a review is \u201conce we have finally turned the page on this pandemic.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut now is not that time,\u201d he said, adding that it also is not the time to reduce resources for operations at the WHO or any other humanitarian group that is working to combat the virus.\n\nThe United States contributed nearly $900 million to the WHO\u2019s budget for 2018-19, according to information on the agency\u2019s website. That represents one-fifth of its total $4.4 billion budget for those years. The U.S. gave nearly three-fourths of the funds in \u201cspecified voluntary contributions\u201d and the rest in \u201cassessed\u201d funding as part of Washington\u2019s commitment to U.N. institutions.\n\nA more detailed WHO budget document provided by the U.S. mission in Geneva showed that in 2019, the United States provided $452 million, including nearly $119 million in assessed funding. In its most recent budget proposal from February, the Trump administration called for slashing the U.S. assessed funding contribution to the WHO to $57.9 million.\n\nMore than 125,000 deaths worldwide, including more than 25,000 in the U.S., have been blamed on the coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nLast week, Trump blasted the WHO for being \u201cChina-centric\u201d and alleging that it had \u201ccriticized\u201d his ban on travel from China as the COVID-19 outbreak was spreading from the city of Wuhan.\n\nThe WHO generally takes care not to criticize countries on their national policies, and it was not immediately clear what specific criticism Trump was alluding to.\n\nTrump himself showed deference to China at the beginning stages of the outbreak.\n\n\u201cChina has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,\" he tweeted Jan. 24. \u201cThe United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!\u201d\n\nAsked Tuesday about the appropriateness of seeking to cut the WHO's funding in the middle of a worldwide viral outbreak, Trump said the review would last 60 to 90 days.\n\n\u201cThis is an evaluation period, but in the meantime, we're putting a hold on all funds going to World Health,\" Trump said. He said the U.S. will continue to engage with the WHO in pursuit of \u201cmeaningful reforms.\u201d\n\nTrump has also complained that other countries give substantially less than the U.S., singling out China.\n\nThe American Medical Association immediately called on Trump to reconsider his decision.\n\n\u201cDuring the worst public health crisis in a century, halting funding to the World Health Organization is a dangerous step in the wrong direction that will not make defeating COVID-19 easier,\" AMA President Patrice A. Harris said in a statement.\n\nHarris said international cooperation is needed to fight the virus, along with science and data.\n\n\"Cutting funding to the WHO, rather than focusing on solutions, is a dangerous move at a precarious moment for the world,\u201d she said.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. But it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death for some people, especially older adults and people with existing health problems. The vast majority of people recover.\n\n------\n\nAssociated Press writer Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report."}}
