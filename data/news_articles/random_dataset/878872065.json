He is set to retire on October 26, just eight days after the retirement of Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin.\n\nFour sitting justices of the SC are vying for the position, including Associate Justices Jose Reyes Jr., Diosdado Peralta, Andres Reyes, and Estela Perlas-Bernabe. They all faced the Judicial Bar Council last week for an interview for the position.\n\nWhile Leonen refused to give his personal pick for the next chief justice, he said \u201cI can imagine a court under Peralta, I can also imagine a court under Bernabe.\u201d\n\nLeonen in August also turned down his automatic nomination as the top magistrate.\n\nThe associate justice explained that he did so because \u201cthere were two who are more qualified than me.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be a chief justice you need to be able to bring the court to a unanimous opinion on most cases, and the way I\u2019ve read my colleagues in the past, given the controversial cases, I thought that it was better as my role to stay at dissenting position,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the next chief justice\n\nLeonen agreed that the next chief justice needs more emotional strength than mental toughness, as Bersamin earlier said.\n\nREAD: Next chief justice should have \u2018less IQ, more EQ\u2019 \u2013 Bersamin\n\n\u201cThe intellectual leadership shows not only in what he or she writes. The intellectual leadership shows in how he is able to bring ideas together, for him or her to step back a little from his or her position, be humble a little and allow others where they are and come up with solutions. That requires a lot of listening. That requires a lot of the chief being able to go to places in the country, even as far down south as Tawi-Tawi to listen to court personnel,\u201d Leonen said.\n\nHe added that it is \u201cvery important\u201d for the next chief justice \u201cto have the personality of being consultative with all the personnel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe next chief justice has to take advantage of all the competencies of all other 14 justices. He or she can\u2019t afford to do it alone and he or she needs to continue the focus on efficiencies, including making an honest to goodness effort to continue with our e-court, looking at integrity of the judges ad justices, checking the competence of judges and of course our lawyers,\u201d he said.\n\nSeniority, Leonen added, is also important in the selection of the next top SC justice.\n\n\u201cIt is important that the next chief justice has been a chair of a committee, a chair of a division, has had a lot of relations with his or her colleagues as well as members of the lower court and personnel of the lower court. That\u2019s where seniority comes in,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSeniority also comes in understanding how the Supreme Court works, the traditions and why the traditions are there.\u201d"}}
