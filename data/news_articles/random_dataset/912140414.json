The C.I.A. pledged to ramp up efforts to learn where he is being held and why Syria refuses to negotiate his release.\n\nThe C.I.A.\u2019s renewed focus on Mr. Tice, who was working as a journalist when he was captured in 2012, reflects a broader push by the Trump administration to focus more intently on Americans being held hostage abroad.\n\nThe administration has helped free Americans held in Egypt, Iran, Turkey and Afghanistan and is trying to win Mr. Tice\u2019s freedom as well as working to find Mark R. Frerichs, a former Navy diver kidnapped last month in Afghanistan. The White House wants him freed before American troops leave the country in a peace deal with the Taliban, an urgent deadline for the Pentagon and intelligence agencies to locate Mr. Frerichs.\n\nReturning American hostages is Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201ctop priority,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week in a statement marking the 13th anniversary of the disappearance inside Iran of Robert A. Levinson, a former F.B.I. agent and C.I.A. contractor."}}
