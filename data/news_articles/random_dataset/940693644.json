and Warsaw, Poland.\n\nThe trip comes as the Pentagon prepares to move forward with a plan to pull almost 12,000 troops from Germany and redeploy part of the U.S. forces to Poland and other NATO nations, raising concerns at home and in Europe even as senior officials defend it as a strategic necessity.\n\nAmbassador Philip Reeker, the State Department's acting assistant secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, said Pompeo will discuss with his counterparts the just-completed U.S.-Poland Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) that \"provides a framework\" to further strengthen \"the broad transatlantic security.\"\n\nThe defense deal enables the United States for \"rotational presence\" of an additional 1,000 U.S. troops to \"enhance deterrence against Russia, strengthen NATO,\" and to assure allies, officials said. About 4,500 U.S. personnel are already on rotation in Poland.\n\nIn Vienna, the U.S.-Austria Strategic Partnership and growing trade relationship will be high on the agenda in Pompeo's meetings with Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg.\n\nAustria hosts the International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear watchdog of the United Nations in charge of monitoring Iran's adherence to the 2015 nuclear deal from which the U.S. has withdrawn.\n\nPompeo will also hold talks with IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, as Washington is calling on other members of the U.N. Security Council to indefinitely extend an arms embargo on Iran that is set to expire on October 18.\n\nIn Warsaw, the chief U.S. diplomat will meet with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz on deepening defense ties, recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, securing 5G networks, and improving regional energy and infrastructure through the Three Seas Initiative. COVID-19 is the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nPompeo will also meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda, who visited the White House in late June.\n\nPoland sees Nord Stream 2, which would double Russia's gas export capacity via the Baltic Sea, as a threat to Europe's energy security.\n\nLast month, the State Department said people making investments or engaging in activities related to Nord Stream 2, including pipe-laying vessels and engineering service in the deployment of the pipelines, could face U.S. sanctions.\n\n\"It's a clear warning to companies: aiding and abetting Russia's malign influence projects will not be tolerated,\" said Pompeo during a July 15 news conference.\n\n\"Let me be clear. These aren't commercial projects. They are the Kremlin's key tools to exploit and expand European dependence on Russian energy supplies,\" Pompeo said."}}
