Inherited cryptocurrencies will be protected under the new law. Meanwhile, several Chinese courts have recently ruled that bitcoin and ethereum are properties protected by law.\n\nInherited Cryptocurrencies Protected by Law\n\nThe third session of the 13th National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), China\u2019s top legislature, voted on and passed the \u201cCivil Code of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u201d on Thursday. In addition to general and supplementary provisions, the civil code \u201dincludes six parts on real rights, contracts, personality rights, marriage and family, inheritance, and tort liabilities,\u201d Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nNoting that the decision to draft a civil code was announced in October 2014 and the legislative process started in June 2016, the news outlet detailed:\n\n[The new civil code] states that the property rights of individuals are equally safeguarded to those of the State and collective, and online virtual assets are protected, too.\n\nWang Chen, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress, told the session that \u201cThe compilation of the civil code is an important component of the plans of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core for developing the rule of law,\u201d the publication conveyed. This new civil code will enter into force on Jan. 1, 2021.\n\nThe scope of inheritance has been expanded from the existing law. Under the new civil code, \u201cvirtual assets, such as bitcoins, [can] be inherited,\u201d as are all property legally acquired by a natural person, the news outlet emphasized.\n\nWang Liming, executive vice president of the Renmin University of China and a law professor, was quoted as saying: \u201cThe civil code is the first law to carry the title \u2018code\u2019 for the People\u2019s Republic of China. It lays down the fundamental principles and regulations regarding civil activities and relations. It reflects the will of the people and protects their rights and interests.\u201d\n\nSeveral Chinese courts have also ruled that cryptocurrencies are property that should be protected by law. For example, the Shanghai No.1 Intermediate People\u2019s Court ruled that bitcoin is an asset protected by law while the Shenzhen Futian District People\u2019s Court ruled that ethereum is legal property with economic value.\n\nMeanwhile, China is working on issuing its own central bank digital currency but there is currently no timetable for the launch, Yi Gang, governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC), told reporters this week. Internal pilot tests have been conducted in various cities \u201cto check the theoretical reliability, system stability, conveniency, applicability and risk controllability of the digital currency,\u201d the governor confirmed.\n\nWhat do you think about China\u2019s new civil code protecting inherited cryptocurrency?
