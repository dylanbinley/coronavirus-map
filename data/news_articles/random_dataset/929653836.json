The choice of whether you\u2019ll get to the hospital is yours.\u201d\n\nMustapha pointed out that it has got to a stage where no amount of enforcement will help stop the spread.\n\nThe PTF Chairman said it is now the choices made by the people that will determine what will happen next.\n\nAccording to him, the people are the only ones that can work assiduously to ensure that the level of transmission is reduced now that it has gone into communities spreading.\n\n\u201cNobody should be deceived that Nigeria has reached the peak of the pandemic,\u201d Mustapha said.\n\nHe warned: \u201cCOVID -19 is real and because restrictions have been lifted is not a licence for carelessness. Yes, we\u2019ll return to a new normal, but not the normal of the past.\n\n\u201cAre figures going to rise? Yes, they\u2019re. The quantum in which they rise is dependent on what we do.\n\n\u201cBut as for the figures, we don\u2019t want to delude anybody; they\u2019ll rise. The quantum with which they\u2019ll rise exponentially or gradually is dependent on what Nigerians do.\u201d\n\nThe SGF warned that if the people decide to be careless because restrictions have been lifted, then the country will have a peak, \u201cif we\u2019re not careful, it can overwhelm even our health infrastructure.\u201d"}}
