King, the American, and Timothy J. Weeks were teachers at the American University in Kabul when they were abducted in 2016 in an attack that left 13 others dead. King and Weeks to be in good health, a senior Trump administration official told the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir release was partly negotiated by American peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who was involved in negotiations with the Taliban this summer for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Those negotiations were stopped by President Trump after a car bomb attack killed an American soldier.\n\nAfghan president Ashraf Ghani said the current prisoner exchange could \u201cfacilitate direct peace negotiations\u201d between the Afghan government and the Taliban. The Taliban have refused to negotiate with Ghani\u2019s government until the U.S. finalizes a plan to withdraw troops from the country, while Ghani demands a ceasefire between insurgents and the government as a precondition for starting talks.\n\nInsurgent leaders Anas Haqqani, Hafiz Abdul Rashid and Hajji Mali Khan were released to the Taliban political office in Doha, Qatar, according to the Trump administration official. Haqqani was a prominent fundraiser and propagandist for the Taliban, while Rashid has equipped and coordinated suicide bombers.\n\nSend a tip to the news team at NR."}}
