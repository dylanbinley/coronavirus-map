She said they have easily adapted to worshiping from home.\n\nThe family discusses what they have been studying that week and then oldest son Ethan plays hymns on the piano.\n\n\"The biggest adjustment has been, of course, missing connections with friends and people,\" Worth said. \"It\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s an opportunity really for us to focus more on family and to have the opportunity to focus on specific questions and thoughts and ideas the kids have.\"\n\nShe said worshiping at home together has brought the family closer spiritually.\n\n\"We share our thoughts and feelings in a more intimate way,\" Worth said. \"Just the five of us. It\u2019s really a special time.\"\n\nWorth is one of 62,326 Latter-day Saints in Ohio, according to an email from Susan Hunter, a church spokeswoman.\n\nRichardson and his wife start their weekly home worship with a hymn or a prayer and then talk about the \"Come follow me\" program, he said. After that, he blesses and distributes the sacrament and they do another hymn and a closing prayer.\n\n\"It\u2019s quite touching to administer the sacrament to your wife and children ... It\u2019s our own little sacrament meeting here,\" he said. \"Everybody\u2019s kind of ministering to each other.\"\n\nHe sees a silver lining to the pandemic.\n\n\"It\u2019s been humbling to the world to recognize that we aren\u2019t independent of each other or God,\" Richardson said. \"It\u2019s just kind of turned people back to God.\"\n\ndking@dispatch.com\n\n@DanaeKing"}}
