He said the week since the storm has been \u201clike hell\u201d for him, as he and his neighbors still remain without power and hot water and have thrown out whatever food they had in their refrigerators and freezers.\n\nMany of them don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll be able to replenish that food.\n\n\u201cEveryone gets their [food] stamps between the first and the 10th, so I knew everybody threw a lot away,\u201d Chatman\u2019s sister, Laisha White, said. She too is still living without electricity at her home across town in southeast Cedar Rapids.\n\nWhen Chatman looks out from his doorway, he faces a hellish landscape \u2014 the building across from his is in tatters, its roof and some of its walls ripped off by the storm, leaving his neighbors\u2019 living rooms, kitchens, and bedrooms exposed to anyone who passes by.\n\n\u201cIt could\u2019ve been our house or something. It could\u2019ve been us,\u201d Chatman said.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MaryGreenNews/status/1295120972413112321\n\nDesiree Burton has lived at Westdale Court for 11 years. She lives two buildings away from the one without the roof and walls, but the only damage her apartment sustained were tears in her window screens.\n\nShe and other residents said they don\u2019t know where the people who lived in the torn-up building have gone.\n\n\u201cScary,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nBurton has been walking around the complex all week, checking up on her neighbors, because she said barely anyone else has.\n\n\u201cNo Red Cross. I saw a Red Cross truck earlier today,\u201d she said. \u201cI have not seen any city officials. Even if I would recognize them, I have not seen them.\u201d\n\nNot knowing when their power will return, Burton said she and her neighbors need flashlights, batteries, candles, and water most of all.\n\nShe said they haven\u2019t been just left in the dark but feel abandoned and forgotten in southwest Cedar Rapids.\n\n\u201cWhere are the big city people?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe are paying them. We have voted you guys in. I understand that you guys may have had trouble yourselves. We are the little people.\u201d\n\nSome strangers responded to that call for help, with a group from Fairfax setting up tables and grills in the apartment complex\u2019s parking lot Sunday and handing out food to anyone who walked over.\n\nThe group said it was there Saturday and came back Sunday, and some residents at Westdale Court said until they showed up, no one else had.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, I guess, disappointing,\u201d one of the volunteers, Nicole Baber, said. \u201cWe have so many resources out there, and when other people have a huge disaster, everybody\u2019s there right away, and it\u2019s just taken forever to get anyone here.\u201d\n\nBy Sunday afternoon and evening, more groups of strangers had shown up at Westdale Court with food and supplies to give out, including the Advocates for Social Justice, a Black Lives Matter group in Cedar Rapids, and World Central Kitchen, an organization founded by Chef Jose Andres that feeds people affected by global disasters.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WCKitchen/status/1295141261029113863\n\nThey were joined by\u2014and fed\u2014more than a dozen roof workers, who arrived in Cedar Rapids from Texas on Sunday and were hammering blue tarps onto roofs at Westdale Court. One worker said they\u2019re expecting to be in Iowa for at least a month, patching up storm damage.\n\nChatman said they\u2019re the first people to make repairs to his building besides a Westdale Court maintenance worker, who boarded up his blown-out front window.\n\nUntil more help shows up, he has no other choice but to wait from his doorway.\n\n\u201cI guess this is how the government feels about us \u2014 basically giving us the middle finger,\u201d Chatman said. \u201cThey really don\u2019t give a damn about us. They really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2020 KCRG. All rights reserved."}}
