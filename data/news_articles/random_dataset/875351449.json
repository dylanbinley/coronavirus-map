I\u2019m scared if he gets impeached, Mike Pence is the replacement, and he knows how to be political.\u201d\n\nAs the U.S. House of Representatives plunged into a formal impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump on Wednesday, Massachusetts\u2019 congressional delegation and many residents on the South Shore cheered the move amid news that the president had acknowledged asking a foreign leader to investigate one of his political opponents, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nBut Trump's supporters on the South Shore stood by him Wednesday, calling the impeachment proceedings a campaign stunt and dismissing concerns about the president's mingling of domestic politics and foreign policy.\n\n\u201cThe law is law, but the guy can\u2019t even have a conversation with a world leader,\u201d said Joe Polsinello, of Hanover.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment probe Tuesday evening after reports that Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to work with the U.S. attorney general and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate Biden, a front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president. In the call this summer, Trump raised allegations, based on scant evidence, that the former vice president tried to interfere with a Ukrainian prosecutor in regards to his son, Hunter. A memo describing the call was released by the White House on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe entire Massachusetts congressional delegation, all of whom are Democrats, has come out in favor of impeachment proceedings since Pelosi\u2019s announcement Tuesday afternoon. Rep. Bill Keating, whose district includes much of the South Shore, tweeted on Tuesday that \u201cthere are a lot of questions here that need answers,\u201d adding that an impeachment inquiry must move forward in Congress.\n\n\u201cThe president has acted to coerce a foreign power to undercut our country\u2019s national security and democracy, an action declared to be an \u2018urgent matter\u2019 by the inspector general,\u201d Keating tweeted. \u201cThe Constitution and our rule of law are at stake right now.\u201d\n\nRep. Stephen Lynch, who drew fire at a town hall in Braintree last month when he declined to support impeachment, appeared to have changed his mind Tuesday.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s actions, currently undisputed, are an attack on our democracy, national security and rule of law, and warrant the commencement of formal impeachment proceedings,\u201d Lynch, whose district includes Quincy and nearby towns, tweeted.\n\nBut several local Trump supporters stood by the president Wednesday, saying his call with the Ukrainian president was nothing to warrant impeachment.\n\nPatrick J. Walsh, a Quincy resident and member of the Trump campaign's Catholic Advisory Group, said impeachment will backfire and that he admires Trump\u2019s ability to have personal conversations with foreign leaders, including the Ukrainian president.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great mistake and it's really going to hurt the Democrats at the ballot box,\u201d Walsh said of the impeachment inquiry. \u201cI see it as an act of desperation.\u201d\n\nPolsinello, the Trump supporter from Hanover, said talk of impeachment was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d that has been going on since before Trump took office in 2017. Polsinello said he is \u201cproud of the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many people who say they hate Trump, but how can you hate anybody?\u201d he said.\n\nNorm Tuttle, chairman of the Quincy Republican Committee, said Trump has an \u201cobligation\u201d to protect the country by looking into Joe Biden\u2019s family\u2019s work in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a farce,\u201d Tuttle said of impeachment. \u201cThis is a campaign stunt, that\u2019s what it is. I guess if I had to do a general analysis of Trump\u2019s presidency, I would prefer that he didn\u2019t use Twitter so much.\u201d\n\nWhile Democrat Hillary Clinton won Massachusetts and a majority of South Shore votes in the 2016 presidential election, some towns in the region went for Trump. A majority of voters in Carver, Halifax, Hanover, Hanson, Kingston, Pembroke, Plympton and Whitman cast their ballots for the Republican.\n\nAnd Trump continues to enjoy the support of a sizable minority of Massachusetts voters more than two and half years into his presidency. A June poll from Suffolk University and The Boston Globe found that 61 percent of Massachusetts voters had an unfavorable view of the president, while 30 percent had a favorable view and 9 percent were undecided.\n\nKatelyn Sahagian contributed reporting to this story, which includes material from The Associated Press.
