The actress attended the UK premiere of Judy on Monday night and got everyone talking with her bright umbrella because, in true UK style, the rain couldn\u2019t help but make an appearance. On behalf of all of us Brits: sorry, Renee. But the umbrella wasn\u2019t actually the only clever accessory choice...\n\nSomewhere under the rainbow umbrella\n\nThe 50-year-old actress, who was styled by Petra Flannery, wore a stunning off-shoulder lilac dress with white Louboutin heels, and we couldn\u2019t help but hope that the red soles were a nod to one of Judy\u2019s most recognisable characters, Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz. When we quizzed the star whether /these/ were a nod to the character, she pointed at her very glitzy ring and explained \u2018ruby!\u2019. So there we have it - no ruby slippers, but a very modern spin instead.\n\nWhat a jewel!\n\nSadly, Renee chose red-soled Louboutins instead of ruby slippers...\n\nThe ring is by David Webb and costs $43,000 (\u00a337,000), so, er, we might just stick to the umbrella if we\u2019re wanting to copy her style. Or Bridget Jones\u2019 knickers. Two far more practical choices, really.\n\nHELLO! at the Judy premiere\n\nAlthough we may be most familiar with Renee\u2019s portrayal of Helen Fielding\u2019s lovable Bridget Jones character, she\u2019s already been tipped for an Oscar for her role as Judy Garland, with the film focusing on the actress\u2019 sold-out London tour and her struggle with depression and substance abuse. Renee, you are one talented lady.\n\nMORE: Renee Zellweger talks about plastic surgery rumours"}}
