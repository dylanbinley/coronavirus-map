Mr Cameron pledges to campaign with \u201call my heart and soul\u201d for Britain to vote to Remain in the referendum, which he said would be by the end of 2017.\n\n\u2013 May 7 2015\n\nThe Tories unexpectedly make sweeping gains over Ed Miliband\u2019s Labour Party and secure a majority in the Commons. Mr Cameron vows to deliver his manifesto pledge for an EU referendum.\n\n\u2013 June 23 2016\n\nThe UK votes to leave the EU in a shock result that saw 52% of the public support Brexit in a humiliating defeat for the Prime Minister. Mr Cameron quickly resigns, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.\u201d\n\n\u2013 July 13 2016\n\nTheresa May takes over as Prime Minister after a bitter selection battle in which she triumphed over rivals including Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Andrea Leadsom. Mrs May, who had backed Remain, promises to \u201crise to the challenge\u201d of negotiating the UK\u2019s exit.\n\n(Hannah McKay/PA)\n\n\u2013 November 10 2016\n\nThe High Court rules against the Government and says Parliament must hold a vote to trigger Article 50, the mechanism that begins the exit from the EU. Mrs May says the ruling would not stop her from invoking the legislation by April 2017.\n\n\u2013 March 29 2017\n\nMrs May triggers Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. European Council president Donald Tusk said that the triggering of Article 50 was not a happy occasion, telling a Brussels press conference his message to the UK was: \u201cWe already miss you. Thankyou and goodbye.\u201d\n\nAdvertising\n\n\u2013 April 18 2017\n\nMrs May announces a snap general election to be held on June 8. Justifying the decision, she said: \u201cThe country is coming together but Westminster is not.\u201d The Prime Minister said \u201cdivision in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit\u201d.\n\n\u2013 June 8 and June 9 2017\n\nA general election takes place in the UK, which results in a hung parliament. Mrs May becomes head of a minority Conservative government \u2013 propped up by the Democratic Unionists \u2013 after her general election gamble backfired disastrously.\n\n\u2013 September 22 2017\n\nIn a crucial Brexit speech in Florence, Mrs May sends a message to EU leaders by saying: \u201cWe want to be your strongest friend and partner as the EU and UK thrive side by side.\u201d She said she was proposing an \u201cimplementation period\u201d of \u201caround two years\u201d after Brexit when existing market access arrangements will apply.\n\n\u2013 December 8 2017\n\nThe European Commission announces it is recommending to the European Council that \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been made in the first phase of Brexit talks. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker tells a press conference in Brussels that negotiations had been \u201cdifficult\u201d for the EU and the UK. The announcement came after Mrs May and Brexit Secretary David Davis made an early-hours journey to Brussels. Mrs May said the Brexit deal was a \u201csignificant improvement\u201d which had required give and take on both sides, and said it would ensure \u201cno hard border\u201d in Ireland.\n\nAdvertising\n\n\u2013 March 19 2018\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says that he and Mr Davis have made a \u201cdecisive step\u201d towards agreeing a joint legal text on the UK\u2019s EU withdrawal. He said there were still outstanding issues relating to the Irish border, saying: \u201cWe are not at the end of the road and there is a lot of work still to be done.\u201d\n\n\u2013 March 23 2018\n\nLeaders of the 27 remaining EU states approve negotiating guidelines for talks on Britain\u2019s future trade and security relations with its European neighbours following Brexit. The move sets the scene for talks on trade to get under way in earnest, following months of wrangling over the terms of the UK\u2019s withdrawal in March 2019 and a 21-month transition period to the new arrangements.\n\n\u2013 June 19 2018\n\nBritain and the European Union publish a joint statement outlining the progress that has been made since negotiations in March. Brussels warns that serious differences remain over how to deal with the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic after Brexit.\n\n\u2013 July 6 2018\n\nBrexit plans are thrashed out by ministers at Chequers. Among them is the creation of a new UK-European Union free trade area for goods. Going into Chequers the Cabinet was split, with Brexit Secretary David Davis understood to have major reservations about both the plan and whether Brussels would even consider it seriously. But it is understood that all members of the Cabinet have signed up to the proposals and none of them have decided to quit rather than back the plan.\n\n\u2013 July 8 and July 9 2018\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis resigns from the Government. In his resignation letter he tells Mrs May \u201cthe current trend of policy and tactics\u201d is making it \u201clook less and less likely\u201d that the UK will leave the customs union and single market. He said he is \u201cunpersuaded\u201d that the Government\u2019s negotiating approach \u201cwill not just lead to further demands for concessions\u201d from Brussels. Mr Davis is replaced by Dominic Raab.\n\n(Stefan Rousseau/PA)\n\n\u2013 November 14 2018\n\nIn a statement outside 10 Downing Street after a five-hour Cabinet meeting, Mrs May said that Cabinet has agreed the draft Brexit withdrawal agreement. She said she believed the draft agreement was \u201cthe best that could be negotiated\u201d. She said: \u201cI firmly believe, with my head and my heart that this is a decision which is in the best interests of the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\n\u2013 November 15 2018\n\nMr Raab resigns as Brexit Secretary, saying he \u201ccannot in good conscience support the terms proposed for our deal with the EU\u201d. More resignations follow, including Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey. Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has submits a letter of no confidence in Mrs May.\n\n\u2013 November 16 2018\n\nStephen Barclay is promoted to Brexit Secretary from a ministerial role in the Department for Health.\n\n\u2013 November 25 2018\n\nThe 27 European Union leaders endorse the Brexit deal. Mrs May says MPs will have to decide whether to back the Brexit deal and \u201cmove forward together into a brighter future\u201d or reject it and \u201copen the door to yet more division and uncertainty\u201d.\n\n\u2013 December 12 2018\n\nMrs May survives an attempt by Tory MPs to oust her with a vote of no confidence. Tory MPs voted by 200 to 117 in the secret ballot in Westminster. Mrs May accepted that a \u201csignificant\u201d number of Tory MPs had voted against her but said she now wanted to \u201cget on with the job\u201d. She said she had a \u201crenewed mission \u2013 delivering the Brexit people voted for, bringing the country back together and building a country that really works for everyone\u201d.\n\n\u2013 January 15 2019\n\nMPs reject Mrs May\u2019s Brexit plans by an emphatic 432 votes to 202 in a historic vote which throws the future of her administration and the nature of the UK\u2019s EU withdrawal into doubt. The humiliating rebuff was delivered in the House of Commons just moments after she made a last-ditch appeal for MPs to back the Withdrawal Agreement which she sealed with Brussels in November after almost two years of negotiation.\n\n\u2013 January 16 2019\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said Brussels \u201cprofoundly regrets\u201d the Commons vote on Mrs May\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement after two years of negotiation \u201cbased on the red lines of the British Government\u201d. Meanwhile, Mrs May survives an attempt to oust her as Prime Minister, as MPs reject Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s motion of no confidence in the Government by a margin of 325 to 306.\n\n\u2013 February 14 2019\n\nMrs May suffers another humiliating Commons defeat after MPs again vote down her latest Brexit plans. MPs voted by 303 to 258 \u2013 a majority of 45 \u2013 against the motion endorsing the Government\u2019s negotiating strategy.\n\n(Victoria Jones/PA)\n\n\u2013 March 12 2019\n\nMPs reject the Government\u2019s Brexit deal by 391 votes to 242. Although the 149 margin was reduced from the record 230-vote defeat of the first \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d in January, Mrs May is left far adrift from a majority with just 17 days to go to the scheduled date of Brexit on March 29.\n\n\u2013 March 14 2019\n\nMPs vote to delay Brexit beyond the scheduled date of March 29 in dramatic parliamentary scenes which saw the Conservative Party split down the middle. More than half of Tory MPs \u2013 including seven Cabinet ministers, at least 33 other ministers and whips, and five party vice-chairs \u2013 voted against Mrs May\u2019s motion to put back the date when Britain leaves the EU.\n\n\u2013 March 20 2019\n\nMrs May tells the House of Commons that that she has written to Donald Tusk to request an extension to the Article 50 Brexit negotiations to June 30. Mr Tusk said a \u201cshort extension\u201d to Article 50 should be possible \u201cconditional\u201d upon a positive vote in the UK Parliament. Mrs May describes the delay to Brexit as a \u201cmatter of great personal regret\u201d, adding: \u201cIt is now time for MPs to decide.\u201d\n\n\u2013 March 27 2019\n\nMPs vote down all eight Brexit options in a series of \u201cindicative votes\u201d designed to establish what kind of deal might secure a majority in Parliament. Proposals for a second referendum on any Brexit deal won 268 votes and a customs union plan won 264, but both were defeated, by 27 and eight votes respectively. A call for withdrawal without a deal was emphatically rejected by 400 votes to 160.\n\n\u2013 March 29 2019\n\nMPs reject Mrs May\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement by 286 votes to 344, majority 58, on the day when the UK was due to leave the European Union. She said the implications of the vote were \u201cgrave\u201d adding: \u201cI fear we are reaching the limits of the process in this House.\u201d\n\n\u2013 April 2 2019\n\nSpeaking in 10 Downing Street following a seven-hour Cabinet, Mrs May says the UK needs an extension to Brexit talks which is \u201cas short as possible\u201d in order to leave the EU with a deal. Mr Corbyn has said he is \u201cvery happy\u201d to meet Mrs May after she offered to sit down with him to agree a plan.\n\n\u2013 April 5 2019\n\nMrs May writes to Mr Tusk asking for an extension to Article 50 to June 30, 2019.\n\n\u2013 April 10 2019\n\nMrs May is called back to the European Council summit in Brussels, amid reports that the other 27 leaders have agreed on a Brexit extension to October 31 with a review in June. Mr Tusk goes on to say the UK has agreed to a \u201cflexible extension\u201d to Brexit until October 31. Mrs May says the \u201cchoices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear\u201d.\n\n\u2013 May 21 2019\n\nMrs May says there is \u201cone last chance\u201d to help MPs deliver the result of the 2016 referendum, as she offered a \u201cnew Brexit deal\u201d. She said a failure to reach agreement on Brexit would lead to a \u201cnightmare future of permanently polarised politics\u201d.\n\n\u2013 May 23 2019\n\nThe UK votes in the European elections which Mrs May hoped would never have had to be held.\n\n\u2013 May 24 2019\n\nMrs May announces she is standing down as Tory party leader on Friday June 7. She said: \u201cIt is and will always remain a matter of deep regret to me that I have not been able to deliver Brexit.\u201d\n\n\u2013 July 23 2019\n\nBoris Johnson is elected as leader of the Conservative Party and becomes the UK\u2019s next prime minister after defeating Jeremy Hunt. Mr Johnson secured 92,153 of the vote compared to 46,656 for Mr Hunt.\n\n(Dominic Lipinski/PA)\n\n\u2013 July 24 2019\n\nMr Johnson uses his first speech in Downing Street to say critics of Brexit \u2013 the \u201cdoubters, doomsters and gloomsters\u201d \u2013 are wrong. He says he is \u201cconvinced we can do a deal\u201d to resolve the issue of the Irish border but he would prepare for a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u2013 July 25 2019\n\nMr Johnson said he would work \u201cflat out\u201d to secure a new agreement on Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. But Brussels responds swiftly, with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker using his first phone call with the new Prime Minister to say the existing Withdrawal Agreement was \u201cthe best and only\u201d deal possible. Mr Johnson said the Government was \u201cturbocharging\u201d preparations for a no-deal break on October 31 if the EU refused to engage.\n\n\u2013 July 30 2019\n\nMr Johnson tells Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that he will approach Brexit negotiations in \u201ca spirit of friendship\u201d but reiterates that any fresh deal must see the backstop abolished. But Mr Varadkar told him that the emergency measure to prevent a hard border on the island was \u201cnecessary as a consequence\u201d of UK decisions.\n\n\u2013 July 31 2019\n\nChancellor Sajid Javid announces that more than \u00a32 billion has been earmarked to spend on no-deal Brexit preparations.\n\n\u2013 August 20 2019\n\nMr Johnson is rebuffed by Brussels after demanding major changes in a new Brexit deal. The Prime Minister set out his call for the backstop \u2013 the contingency plan to avoid a hard border with Ireland \u2013 to be scrapped from the divorce deal ahead of the October 31 Brexit deadline. But European Council president Donald Tusk defended the measure and warned that those seeking to replace it would risk a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland.\n\n\u2013 August 27 2019\n\nIn a joint statement issued following cross-party Brexit talks led by Mr Corbyn, Westminster opposition leaders said they \u201cagreed on the urgency to act together to find practical ways to prevent no-deal, including the possibility of passing legislation and a vote of no confidence\u201d.\n\n\u2013 August 28 2019\n\nMr Johnson rejects claims his decision to hold a Queen\u2019s Speech on October 14 is designed to block MPs from considering ways to thwart his Brexit plans after he was accused of mounting a \u201ccoup\u201d against Parliament. Mr Corbyn says the Prime Minister\u2019s plan to suspend Parliament is \u201can outrage and a threat to our democracy\u201d. The Queen approves an order to prorogue Parliament no earlier than September 9 and no later than September 12, until October 14.\n\n\u2013 August 30 2019\n\nFormer prime minister Sir John Major says he wants to join a legal action being brought by campaigner Gina Miller over Mr Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament.\n\n\u2013 September 2 2019\n\nMr Johnson says he is \u201cencouraged by the progress we are making\u201d and the chances of a Brexit deal \u201care rising\u201d. He warns that MPs would \u201cchop the legs out\u201d from the UK position if they backed a Brexit extension and stressed there were \u201cno circumstances\u201d in which he would personally seek a delay.\n\n\u2013 September 3 2019\n\nMr Johnson says Parliament is \u201con the brink of wrecking any deal\u201d with Brussels after voting to give a cross-party alliance control of the Commons agenda on Wednesday in a bid to block a no-deal Brexit on October 31.\n\n\u2013 September 4 2019\n\nA judge at the highest court in Scotland finds that Mr Johnson\u2019s planned prorogation of Parliament is lawful. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson says \u201cthere must now be an election on Tuesday October 15\u201d after legislation designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit cleared the Commons. But his attempt to trigger an early general election fails after his motion did not secure the required support of two-thirds of MPs, with the Commons voting 298 to 56.\n\n\u2013 September 6 2019\n\nA legal challenge brought over Mr Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks is rejected by leading judges at the High Court in London.\n\n\u2013 September 10 2019\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s second attempt to trigger an early general election fails after his motion did not secure the required support of two-thirds of MPs, with the Commons voting 293 to 46.\n\n\u2013 September 11 2019\n\nA legal bid to challenge the suspension of parliament succeeds at the appeal court in Edinburgh, with judges ruling Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament was \u201cunlawful\u201d. The Government says it is \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the decision, adding proroguing Parliament was \u201clegal and necessary\u201d.\n\n\u2013 September 16 2019\n\nDowning Street says Mr Johnson and Jean-Claude Juncker has agreed Brexit talks \u201cneeded to intensify\u201d, but the Prime Minister also \u201creiterated that he would not request an extension\u201d and would take the UK out of the EU on October 31.\n\n\u2013 September 17 2019\n\nA legal battle over Mr Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks begins at the UK\u2019s highest court. The Supreme Court in London is hearing appeals from two separate challenges\n\nbrought in England and Scotland to the prorogation of Parliament over three days.\n\n\u2013 September 24 2019\n\nLady Hale, president of the Supreme Court, said the 11 justices had ruled unanimously that Mr Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen to suspend Parliament until October 14 was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating Parliament.\n\n\u2013 October 2 2019\n\nBoris Johnson puts forward his formal Brexit plan to the EU revealing his blueprint to solve the Irish border issue and says it is a compromise but European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker says there are \u201cstill problematic points\u201d. It sparks 10 days of intense negotiations.\n\n(Stefan Rousseau/PA)\n\n\u2013 October 4 2019\n\nDocuments read out at the Scottish Court of Session reveal Boris Johnson has accepted he will have to send a letter to the EU requesting a delay if an agreement is not reached by October 19, although the Prime Minister later says the UK will leave on October 31 with \u201cno delay\u201d.\n\n\u2013 October 7 2019\n\nThe Court of Session in Edinburgh dismisses a legal case aimed at forcing Boris Johnson to send a letter to the EU requesting a Brexit delay.\n\n\u2013 October 10 2019\n\nBoris Johnson and Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar say a Brexit deal \u201cis in everyone\u2019s interest\u201d and they can see a \u201cpathway to a deal\u201d in a joint statement after conducting talks at a luxury hotel in Cheshire.\n\n\u2013 October 17 2019\n\nAfter intense negotiations, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announces the UK has reached a \u201cgreat deal\u201d with the EU that \u201ctakes back control\u201d and means that \u201cthe UK can come out of the EU as one United Kingdom \u2013 England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, together\u201d. Mr Johnson said he is \u201cvery confident\u201d that when MPs study the deal they will want to vote for it. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker says the deal is a \u201cfair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions\u201d. But the DUP says it cannot support the deal in Parliament, citing a series of objections over the integrity of the union and Northern Ireland\u2019s economy."}}
