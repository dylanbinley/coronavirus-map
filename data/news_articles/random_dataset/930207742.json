All parties agree that it may. The dispute is instead primarily about the procedure the agency followed in doing so,\u201d Roberts wrote in the opinion.\n\nWhat this means for DACA: \u201cThe ruling keeps intact a program that is open to an estimated 1.3 million noncitizens who are eligible for DACA by virtue of having been brought to the U.S. as children, and who have maintained residency and meet the education or military service requirements and other criteria.\u201d\n\nWhat this means for Trump: it upended a key campaign platform for President Trump Donald John TrumpTwo 'The Apprentice' producers helping with Republican National Convention About 70,000 lives could be saved in near future if people wear masks: researchers Trump issues disaster declaration for California as wildfires rage MORE.\n\nWhat it looked like outside the Supreme Court this morning:\n\nHyperlink https://bit.ly/2N6AisE\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD THE FULL DECISION:\n\nhttps://cnn.it/311oCiS\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE REACTION WE\u2019VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR \u2014 FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP:\n\n\u201cThese horrible & politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives.

Good day, hard place! *Howdy!*:\n\nVia The Hill\u2019s Alexander Bolton, Sen. Schumer (D-N.Y.) is in a tough spot deciding where to support Senate Republicans\u2019 police reform bill even though the legislation falls short of what Democrats want.\n\nThe pro of supporting the bill: It will allow the legislation to move forward and increases the likelihood of any police reform legislation getting signed into law.\n\nThe con of supporting the bill: It will disappoint Democrats and will give President Trump a pretty big victory a few months before Election Day.\n\nWhy Schumer\u2019s support will make or break the bill: Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate. For the bill to move forward, Republicans will need seven Democratic or independent senators.\n\nA worry for Schumer: If he lets the bill move forward to a floor debate, Democrats will have little power to amend it.\n\nHow this could play out: https://bit.ly/3fwk6Nm\n\n\n\n\n\nIN THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n\n\nOn today\u2019s episode of Maury: West Wing Edition\u2026:\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, Former White House national security adviser John Bolton tore (and I mean TORE) into President Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nOuch: \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s fit for office,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has the competence to carry out the job. There really isn\u2019t any guiding principle that I was able to discern other than, \u2018What\u2019s good for Donald Trump\u2019s reelection?\u2019 \u201d\n\n^ Watch the clip: https://bit.ly/2Z0ZPt1\n\nWhen the interview will air: Sunday at 9 p.m. EDT.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe timing of Bolton\u2019s comments are not random:\n\nBolton\u2019s interview will air just two days before Simon & Schuster releases his book, \u201cThe Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir.\" https://bit.ly/2YNCY3H\n\n\n\n\n\nNEWSY EXCERPTS FROM THE BOOK:\n\nBolton describes Trump as \u2018stunningly uninformed\u2019: \"He second-guessed people's motives, saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government,\" Bolton writes. The gist of the book, via The Hill\u2019s Reid Wilson: https://bit.ly/3d8jnR2\n\nBolton says Trump asked China to help him win reelection: At the Group of 20 summit in June last year, President Trump asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to help him win reelection. (Via The Washington Post\u2019s Josh Dawsey) Details: https://wapo.st/3d8L8ZD\n\nBolton says the impeachment inquiry missed a few incidents: \u201cBolton describes several episodes where the president expressed a willingness to halt criminal investigations \u2018to, in effect, give personal favors to dictators he liked,\u2019 citing cases involving major firms in China and Turkey. \u2018The pattern looked like obstruction of justice as a way of life, which we couldn\u2019t accept,\u2019 Mr. Bolton writes, saying that he reported his concerns to Attorney General William P.

It toggles between two discordant registers: exceedingly tedious and slightly unhinged.\u201d\n\nRead the full review: https://nyti.ms/2BnNnuQ\n\n\n\n\n\nWHEN THE BOOK WILL BE RELEASED:\n\nOn June 23.
