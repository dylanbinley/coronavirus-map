But Republicans refused to debate the measures in a special session called by Evers.\n\nIn the face of that opposition, it\u2019s a \u201crational pivot\u201d for Evers to focus on mental health services, Hintz said.\n\n\u201cIf that is sort of the beginning of common ground with Republicans, then we need to start there,\u201d Shilling said. \u201cI have long said to my Republican colleagues, you need to work on building small \u2018t\u2019 trust with the governor. We\u2019re never gonna get the capital \u2018t\u2019 trust because that\u2019s not the environment we\u2019re in. But building small \u2018t\u2019 trust goes both ways.\u201d\n\nShilling said she was hopeful lawmakers could work together on \u201csmall areas of bipartisanship.\u201d That includes combating homelessness, addressing the \u201cdark store\u201d issue related to how empty businesses are taxed that is important to local governments, medical marijuana and improving mental health services for children."}}
