Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan have rival claims in the South China Sea.\n\nIndonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi told reporters Widodo had asked Japan to invest in fisheries, energy and tourism in Natuna.\n\n\u201cWe also agreed to strengthen coastguard coordination,\u201d he said.\n\nIndonesia had stepped up air and sea patrols in the area and summoned China\u2019s ambassador over the appearance of the ships. An Indonesian military spokesman said the vessels left the area after Widodo\u2019s trip.\n\nChina says it is in contact with Indonesia through diplomatic channels to resolve differences and uphold stability in the region.\n\nMotegi, speaking through a translator after a meeting with Marsudi, did not refer to China but said Japan was wary about the situation in the South China.\n\n\u201cWe shared a serious concern regarding efforts to change with force the status quo unilaterally and we confirmed continuing close collaboration,\u201d he said.\n\nJapan last year gave Indonesia 100 billion rupiah ($7.26 million) to build a fish market in Natuna, which will be named Tsukiji after the famous Tokyo market, media reported.\n\nConstruction of the market in Natuna, and markets on other Indonesian islands, will begin this year, Motegi said.
