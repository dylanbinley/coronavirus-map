Stephanie Murphy: Yea\n\nRep. Bill Posey: Nay\n\nRep. Darren Soto: Yea\n\nRep. Val Demings: Yea\n\nRep. Daniel Webster: Nay\n\nRep. Michael Waltz: Nay\n\nRep. Ted Yoho: Nay\n\n\u201cBased on the evidence, it is clear the President withheld taxpayer dollars that Congress appropriated as leverage to pressure the government of Ukraine to investigate his potential rival in the 2020 election. The evidence President Trump obstructed Congress is equally compelling,\u201d Rep. Stephanie Murphy posted on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe impeachment of Donald Trump does not meet a single requirement laid out by Speaker Pelosi. This sham impeachment is divisive because it was orchestrated by Dems strictly for partisan gain,\u201d Rep. Ted Yoho posted on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThis president abused his power, jeopardizing our national security in an extortion scheme to cheat in the 2020 election. He continues to be an active and ongoing threat to our democracy,\" Rep Val Demings said.\n\n\u201cWhile Republicans didn\u2019t win the vote, we unquestionably won the argument. Tonight we showed that with sound argument, by sticking to the facts and showing how unfair this process has been, we\u2019ve vindicated our support for POTUS,\u201d Rep. Matt Gaetz said.\n\n\u201cThe House Democrats just spent a month confirming that the President did nothing wrong and that this impeachment circus is nothing but partisan politics. Today\u2019s vote solidifies how little the Democrats care about what\u2019s really important to the American people. It\u2019s clear all they care about are political games. This is sad and embarrassing, but I came to Washington to get something done for the American people. I look forward to getting back to working on all the things that aren\u2019t getting done, like passing No Budget, No Pay, securing the border, and lowering drug prices for American families,\" Senator Rick Scott said.\n\n\u201cI have spent countless hours assessing evidence, going through witness testimony and reading through both Democrat and Republican reports. After careful consideration, it became categorically clear that President Trump abused his power and obstructed justice through actions I deem as impeachable conduct,\u201d Rep. Darren Soto said."}}
