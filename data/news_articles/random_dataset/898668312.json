After it rules, a Supreme Court appeal seems close to inevitable. The case may not be resolved in time to matter in the impeachment trial, but it may nonetheless yield a foundational ruling on the structure of the Constitution.\n\nIn its appeals court brief, the administration said the issues in the case were both momentous and novel. \u201cFor only the second time in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d the administration told the appeals court, \u201ca court has ordered a close presidential adviser to appear and testify before Congress.\u201d (The first decision, from a trial judge in 2008, concerned a subpoena to Harriet Miers, Mr. Bush\u2019s former White House counsel. The two sides settled before the appeals court could rule.)\n\nAt the argument in the McGahn case, Mr. Mooppan, the administration\u2019s lawyer, made two basic arguments, both sweeping. Mr. Trump and his close advisers, Mr. Mooppan said, have absolute immunity from congressional subpoenas, meaning they cannot be made to appear to be questioned about anything at all, whether or not executive privilege or some other protection might apply to particular inquiries.\n\nBut Mr. Mooppan said there was no need for the appeals court to decide that issue, as federal courts have no role in adjudicating disputes between the other branches. In 1997, he noted, the Supreme Court rejected a suit against executive branch officials from six individual lawmakers, saying they had not suffered the sort of direct injury that gave them standing to sue.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit, however, has said that \u201cthe mere fact that there is a conflict between the legislative and executive branches over a congressional subpoena does not preclude judicial resolution of the conflict.\u201d It drew support from United States v. Nixon, the 1974 Supreme Court decision requiring President Richard M. Nixon to turn over tapes of conversations with aides, calling that \u201can analogous conflict between the executive and judicial branches.\u201d\n\nBut the Nixon case arose in the context of a criminal trial, and the Supreme Court went out of its way to say that it was not \u201cconcerned here with the balance between the president\u2019s generalized interest in confidentiality\u201d and \u201ccongressional demands for information.\u201d\n\nCongress may have ways other than lawsuits to persuade or force the administration to comply, Judge Griffith said at the appeals court argument."}}
