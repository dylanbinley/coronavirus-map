Prof. Pyne believed the university\u2019s embarrassment lay at the root of a series of complaints about his behaviour that led to his suspension.\n\nThe CAUT report found that Thompson Rivers has a weak institutional understanding of academic freedom, and that there were significant breaches of Prof. Pyne\u2019s academic freedom. There were also significant breaches of his privacy, the report found, as details of Prof. Pyne\u2019s university-ordered psychological evaluation were shared with \u201ca large number\u201d of people without his permission.\n\nProf. Pyne said he was pleased with the report\u2019s conclusions. \u201cIt feels like vindication,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very stressful.\u201d\n\nProf. Pyne, 55, returned to teaching in January this year.\n\nThompson Rivers University president Brett Fairbairn said it\u2019s healthy for universities to debate academic freedom.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m most interested in what our own faculty think of academic freedom, rather than CAUT,\u201d Mr. Fairbairn said.\n\nA faculty committee is working on an academic freedom statement that he hopes will soon be ready for presentation to the broader university community. He said he sees no cause for concern for the university\u2019s reputation stemming from this report.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe university declined to participate in the CAUT investigation, which was conducted by Mark MacLean, professor of mathematics at University of British Columbia, and Carla Graebner, librarian at Simon Fraser University.\n\nThe CAUT report makes a number of recommendations but is an external process conducted by a faculty advocacy group with no authority over the university.\n\nThe report raised concerns about the university\u2019s decision to bar Prof. Pyne from campus in the summer of 2018. The evidence seen by the investigators did not justify such a decision, they wrote. They also had serious concerns about a psychologist\u2019s report evaluating Prof. Pyne\u2019s mental health, which was done at the university\u2019s request.\n\n\u201cWe are shocked that this report has been allowed to circulate into the hands of so many individuals at TRU and beyond in the management of this case. This is a serious breach of Dr. Pyne\u2019s privacy rights,\u201d the report states.\n\nProf. Pyne said he had not known his health details had been circulated inside the university. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about that. I\u2019d like to find out more,\u201d he said.\n\nThe report states that Prof. Pyne \u201ccan be extremely blunt in presenting his academic opinions,\u201d and that colleagues could feel attacked. Thompson Rivers administrators seem to have concluded that \u201che needs to be silenced to protect the safety his colleagues,\u201d the report says.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nProf. Pyne said he hopes to get back to his research soon, but the process has been draining.\n\nOur Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day\u2019s most important headlines.
