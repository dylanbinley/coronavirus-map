Reportedly, he was at Vietnam for vacation, where he had travelled across 4,000 km in the country. The cinematographer had assured the director Dr Raghavendra BS that he had seen picturesque locations during his vacation. The director, who was looking for fresh locations, went to Vietnam along with Naveen to revisit the locations.\n\nTimes Of India quoted actor Prem as saying, \u201cWe also travelled 17 hours to shoot at paddy fields located in what is known to be the village that is right at the tip of the country. The village had only one hotel, with very few facilities. Everyone was ready to take on any new challenge. The food in Vietnam requires a little acclimatization, which our team found challenging. So, we decided to have our cook with us too,\u201d he signs off.\n\nCredits :Times Of India\n\nRead More"}}
