The two groups were awarded more than $1 million, triggering a whistleblower complaint filed by the Justice Department's employee union to the department's Inspector General.\n\nIn a Sept. 23 memo, which was seen by Reuters, the DOJ says that the change was in an effort to distribute funding across \"as many states as possible.\"\n\nIn December, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees local 2830 filed its complaint in which it asked the inspector general to investigate whether politics factored in the two grant awards.\n\nIn a statement, union president Marilyn Moses told Reuters that the grants call into question the department's mission to serve the public. \"Our employees take their \u2026 responsibility to the taxpayer very seriously,\" she told Reuters.\n\nHookers for Jesus is run by Annie Lobert, a born-again Christian trafficking survivor who has lobbied against decriminalizing prostitution. the organization runs a safe house for trafficking victims and, according to Reuters, requires guests to go to religious services and follow other strict rules. The nonprofit was awarded 530,190 over three years.\n\nInsider reached out to Lobert, but she said by email she is unavailable to comment until Friday.\n\nThe Lincoln Tubman Foundation, of South Carolina, was awarded $549,345 over three years. It was launched by the daughter of a prominent local Republican who supported President Donald Trump, Reuters reported. The organization is a private non-operating foundation, which means that it disburses funds to other non-profits rather than running its own charity program.\n\nAlternatively, Chicanos Por La Causa has opposed the Trump administration's immigration policies, and the head of Catholic Charities in Palm Beach has participated in past Democratic National Committees as a delegate or standing committee member, Reuters reported."}}
