Salah was leader of the Northern Branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel, which Israel banned in 2015 for allegedly having links to terror groups and inciting deadly violence.\n\nSalah was arrested and charged in 2017 for praising three Arab Israelis who shot dead two police officers in an attack at the Temple Mount compound. The attack, and Israel\u2019s ensuing decision to beef up security at the holy site, significantly ramped up tensions between Israel and the Arab world."}}
