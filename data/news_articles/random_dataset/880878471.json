Picture: AAP Image/David Mariuz\n\nNow, with the backing of Tesla billionaire Musk \u2014 who said he could install the battery in 100 days and in fact did it in 63, thereby winning a $50 million bet \u2014 the Premier is spruiking that the state leads the world in renewable energy.\n\nMonths out from an election, it\u2019s a weighty claim, but the Premier now has the runs on the board to support it.\n\nMr Weatherill\u2019s jubilation may well take a dent the next time there\u2019s a major blackout, but for now he can taunt his political foes, starting with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nAdelaide's Afternoon Newsbyte \u2014 1/12/17 Adelaide's Afternoon Newsbyte \u2014 1/12/17\n\nIn a calculated political jibe, the PM suggested the statewide blackout was a result of SA\u2019s reliance on renewables. Now Mr Weatherill wants him to travel to Jamestown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for him to repair some of the damage to the reputation of South Australa when he criticised us and blamed us for the blackout,\u201d Mr Weatherill said.\n\nAnd this time the weather was on his side, too. The battery was successfully used on Thursday to bolster the grid as Victoria\u2019s power system struggled in extreme heat.\n\nThe Tesla powerpacks at Hornsdale are designed to allow wind energy to be delivered to the grid at any time, whether the wind is blowing or not, boosting the state\u2019s energy security.\n\nAnatomy of a statewide blackout Anatomy of a statewide blackout\n\nThe launch, also attended by Neoen deputy chief executive Romain Desrousseaux, followed a successful testing period.\n\n\u201cNeoen and Tesla approached the State Government with their bold plan to deliver this project, and they have met all of their commitments, ensuring South Australia has back-up power this summer,\u201d Mr Weatherill said.\n\nMr Desrousseaux said: \u201cNeoen is focused on delivering long-term, sustainable energy solutions to the country and ambitious projects like the Hornsdale Power Reserve will contribute to South Australia leading the way into a clean energy future.\u201d"}}
