Beijing said the visit had violated its \u201cterritorial sovereignty and sabotaged political mutual trust\u201d, reported PTI.\n\nThe neighbouring country, which claims the region as its own and calls it South Tibet, has repeatedly protested against Indian politicians visiting the northeastern state.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s position on the eastern sector of the China-India boundary, or the southern part of China\u2019s Tibet region, is consistent and clear,\u201d the country\u2019s Foreign Minister Geng Shuang said. \u201cThe Chinese government has never recognised the so-called \u2018Arunachal Pradesh\u2019 and is firmly opposed to the Indian politician\u2019s visit to the southern part of China\u2019s Tibet region as it violated China\u2019s territorial sovereignty, undermined stability of the border area, sabotaged political mutual trust, and violated relevant bilateral agreement.\u201d\n\nThe foreign minister urged the Indian side to refrain from taking any action that could \u201ccomplicate the border issue\u201d. It added that concrete steps to maintain peace and tranquility in the border area should be taken.\n\nAt 34th Statehood Day Function of Arunachal Pradesh in Itanagar. https://t.co/BUTwfscAhr \u2014 Amit Shah (@AmitShah) February 20, 2020\n\nIndia and China have a 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control between them. In April 2017, China had renamed six places in Arunachal Pradesh after lodging protests with India over the Dalai Lama\u2019s visit to the state. In the past too, Beijing has protested against the visits to Arunachal Pradesh by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Ram Nath Kovind and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, claiming that their trips were not conducive to the region\u2019s \u201ctranquility and peace\u201d. The two countries have so far held 21 rounds of talks to resolve the boundary dispute.\n\nThe Ministry of External Affairs dismissed China\u2019s stand on Thursday. \u201cIt [Arunachal Pradesh] is an integral part of India,\u201d said the ministry\u2019s spokesperson Raveesh Kumar during the weekly briefing. \u201cIndian leaders routinely travel to the state as they do to any other states of India. Objecting to visit of an Indian leader to any state in India doesn\u2019t stand to reason.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Shah told people in the northeastern states that the Narendra Modi-led administration had no plans to repeal the region\u2019s special status. \u201cMisinformation was spread after abrogation of Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, that Article 371 will also be scrapped,\u201d he said at the gathering to mark the 34th foundation day of Arunachal Pradesh. \u201cIt will never happen. Nobody has any such intention.\u201d\n\nMost of the states in the North East have been accorded special provisions under Article 371 to preserve their indigenous cultures. Article 371B deals with special provision granted to Assam.\n\nThe home minister said that the \u201creal emotional integration\u201d of the region with the rest of India had occurred under the Modi-led administration. He claimed that when Bharatiya Janata Party leaders come for election campaigns in 2024, the \u201cNorth East will have been free from problems like militancy and inter-state strife\u201d."}}
