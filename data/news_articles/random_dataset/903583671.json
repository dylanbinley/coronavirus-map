The two struck a deal worth about RUB2 billion in November 2018, also for the Yarudeyskoye Oilfield, which is in Russia's oil- and gas-rich Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug in the country's far north, where NOVATEK is based. The area's natural gas production makes up 90 percent of Russia's total and almost one-fifth of the globe's.\n\nZPEC has actively expanded overseas in recent years, landing other drilling gigs in Iraq, Ukraine, Pakistan and other countries. It also signed a contract with a unit of Russia's largest oil company Rosneft for boring services in the same region in May last year.\n\nEditor: Ben Armour"}}
