And then he tried his best to cover it up and he had an opportunity to do it again because nobody slapped him on the wrist.\u201d After McGhee finished criticizing the Democrats for their failure to impeach President Trump, Maher asked \u201cis it too late?\u201d Energized by enthusiastic applause from the crowd, Maher described impeachment as \u201cthe right thing to do,\u201d adding \u201cit was the right thing to do two minutes into his presidency.\n\nAndrew Sullivan of New York magazine briefly pumped the brakes. He described a President\u2019s conversation with a foreign leader as \u201cpretty close to pure executive privilege,\u201d stressing that \u201cif every presidential conversation like that were to be subject to exposure, Presidents couldn\u2019t operate.\u201d Sullivan proceeded to suggest that conversations with foreign leaders should not fall into the category of executive privilege right now because \u201cwe have a uniquely corrupt...crazy, unhinged, President.\u201d\n\nDigging into the archives, Maher discussed how newspapers 21 years ago at this time were calling for President Clinton to resign; complaining that no newspaper today has asked President Trump to resign. Sullivan explained to Maher that the papers had a strong reaction to President Clinton\u2019s misdeeds \u201cbecause we had a functioning liberal democracy,\u201d in contrast to today. Sullivan also slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for failing to impeach President Trump, calling her \u201cultimately responsible for the continuation of the most profound corruption that we\u2019ve seen in the presidency for a very, very, very long time.\u201d\n\nAt one point in the conversation, Maher expressed concern that voters will conclude that Democrats are \u201cobsessed with impeachment\u201d and resent the fact that they are \u201cnot talking about what matters to me.\u201d Nonetheless, Maher and many others in the media remain hopeful that they have finally found the smoking gun that will take out President Trump.\n\nA transcript of the relevant portion of Friday\u2019s edition of Real Time With Bill Maher is below. Click \u201cexpand\u201d to read more.\n\nReal Time With Bill Maher\n\n09/20/19\n\n10:20 PM\n\nBILL MAHER: Well, impeachment is in the news. It\u2019s talked about it again\u2026all the media was talking about today was this whistle-blower scandal. I\u2019m not going to go through it again, I did it in the monologue. It seems to me that every\u2026certainly Republican candidate I\u2019ve ever known, read about, has had some sort of dirty trickster, you know, whether it\u2019s Karl Rove, or who was the guy Bush had? You know\u2026died of a brain.\n\nANDREW SULLIVAN: Atwater.\n\nTIM NAFTALI: Atwater.\n\nMAHER: Atwater. Lee Atwater, Roger Ailes, Roger Stone. Trump seems to want to make the President of Ukraine\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMAHER: \u2026his, his dirty guy to dig up dirt on his opponent. And a lot of people today were saying, oh, we got him, you know, like I\u2019ve never heard that one before because this is different because there was a bribe involved, maybe and I\u2026I don\u2019t\u2026I wouldn\u2019t get my hopes up. Is this going to turn\u2026maybe you can convince me this is going to be different. Is this \u201cwe got him\u201d is going to be different? Right now, I don\u2019t think so.\n\nHEATHER MCGHEE: Well, I think it\u2019s up to the Democrats, right? And\u2026and I think we\u2019re seeing right now what happens because we didn\u2019t impeach. This man in the White House encouraged a foreign power to help him win an election\u2026at, in that instance with Russia, to attack our sovereignty. And then he tried his best to cover it up and he had an opportunity to do it again because nobody slapped him on the wrist. And I do think, I have so much respect for Nancy Pelosi, but I think it is a fundamental miscalculation to think that we should not impeach this President, no matter what happens\u2026\n\nMAHER: But is it too late?\n\nMCGHEE: Because it\u2019s about the Constitution.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMAHER: Certainly\u2026certainly that would be the right thing to do, but it was the right thing to do like two minutes into his\u2026\n\nNAFTALI: No, it\u2019s not\u2026\n\nMAHER: \u2026presidency.\n\nTIM NAFTALI: It\u2019s not too late. I\u2019ll tell you why it\u2019s not too late.\n\nMAHER: Okay.\n\nNAFTALI: Because you don\u2019t have to convict the President, because the Senate\u2019s not going to convict this President. To set a\u2026a proper tone, you have to make corruption cost something.\n\nMCGHEE: That\u2019s right.\n\nNAFTALI: You have to\u2026because this is not about Trump. This is about future presidents. If you get, let somebody get away\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNAFTALI: \u2026with it, then you are sending a signal\u2026\n\nMAHER: But they have.\n\nNAFTALI: But no, no, this is\u2026I\u2026I was not an impeachment now person simply because I didn\u2019t think the Mueller report laid out a political case for impeachment. I didn\u2019t think Americans would\u2026would rally around the idea that obstruction of justice when there\u2019s no underlying crime was a reason to overthrow an elected\u2026an election result. Now, I know that\u2026that obstruction of justice is always a crime, regardless of whether there\u2019s an underlying crime but that\u2019s a legalism. It\u2019s important but to\u2026to basically say to the American people, the 2016 election has been nullified, you\u2019ve got to have something more powerful. I mean, look, the Nixon\u2026Nixon made so many crimes, you could have\u2026every day of the week, you could have talked of one of his crimes.\n\nMAHER: But we did\u2026but we had the Mueller thing, you know, in terms\u2026\n\nNAFTALI: And that wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nMAHER: I\u2019m just asking about the\u2026I\u2019m not politically. Like, for the person who\u2019s been watching this for three years\u2026I think there\u2019s a lot of Republicans who think, yeah, Trump did a lot of impeachable stuff, and they have no respect for Democrats for not holding his feet to the fire. Democrats are the super indulgent parent who never disciplined the kid who now can get away with anything. That\u2019s who Democrats are.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMAHER: But now that all this time has passed and they didn\u2019t get him for this and this and this and this, it just looks like, oh, this is a road-show version of Russia. We couldn\u2019t get him on Russia? We\u2019re going to try the next country over, Ukraine. That\u2019s what it looks like and people are like\u2026\n\nNAFTALI: This is a bigger deal.\n\nMAHER: You know, Mike Pence said this week, in the last debate, Democrats didn\u2019t talk about the economy at all; didn\u2019t talk about the economy. I think that\u2019s what the voter is going to say. It\u2019s like you guys are obsessed with this, and you\u2019re fucking bad at it and you\u2019re not talking about what matters to me. I\u2019m worried about the end of the month, not the end of the world. I\u2019m just\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSULLIVAN: But at the same\u2026at the same time, we have a President clearly abusing\u2026\n\nMAHER: Yes, clearly\u2026\n\nSULLIVAN: \u2026his power.\n\nMAHER: Yes he does.\n\nSULLIVAN: I know.\n\nMAHER: I know, it\u2019s\u2026\n\nSULLIVAN: If the Democrats had any balls, they would\u2026\n\nMAHER: Exactly.\n\nSULLIVAN: \u2026have him on the ropes.\n\nMAHER: Yes.\n\nSULLIVAN: The other problem is that when a President talks to a foreign leader, confidentially, that is pretty close to pure executive privilege. And if every President\u2026if every presidential conversation like that were to be subject to exposure, Presidents couldn\u2019t operate. The trouble is we have a unique President. We have a uniquely corrupt\u2026\n\nMAHER: Yes.\n\nSULLIVAN: \u2026crazy, unhinged President.\n\nMAHER: Yes, we do.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMAHER: All right, I just want to mention this. Somebody mentioned this in the press and I thought I would repeat it. I didn\u2019t realize this. 21 years ago, you know what the press was talking about? Clinton should resign. This was 1998, in the middle of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 115 newspapers, including USA Today, Philadelphia Enquirer: \u201cthe President should resign because his repeated reckless deceits have dishonored his presidency beyond repair.\u201d San Francisco, San Francisco, liberal San Francisco, the Examiner, \u201che\u2019s a liar, he\u2019s an unfaithful husband, he\u2019s tarnished the White House. He\u2019s got to go.\u201d Wow.\n\nMCGHEE: Yeah.\n\nMAHER: That\u2019s where we went from 21 years, that\u2019s where we went to now.\n\nSULLIVAN: Because we had a functioning liberal democracy, in which people were not behaving the way they\u2019re behaving\u2026\n\nMAHER: But I haven\u2019t heard\u2026\n\nSULLIVAN: What we have now.\n\nMAHER: Has any\u2026has any newspaper called for his resignation?\n\nSULLIVAN: I think several people\u2026\n\nMCGHEE: Yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: \u2026have called for impeachment\u2026\n\nMCGHEE: But not like that.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSULLIVAN: The trouble is we have all become what the\u2026what the torture apologists called\u2026we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve developed into learned helplessness. Right? We\u2026we know this stuff is outrageous, and we know we should have\u2026but how do we keep the energy up for that? Unless we have leadership from the Congress. And Nancy Pelosi is ultimately responsible for the continuation of the most profound corruption that we\u2019ve seen in the presidency for a very, very, very long time.\n\nMAHER: But she doesn\u2019t have the votes. That\u2019s what her\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMAHER: \u2026Isn\u2019t that her thing?\n\nMCGHEE: Well, no I mean, she\u2026I think she\u2019s making a political calculation; something akin to what you just said. That basically, you know, voters want to hear that they passed a $15 minimum wage; which they did. Which no voter heard about, at all. That would have been amazing had the Senate took it up; had McConnell not turned the legislative\u2026\n\nMAHER: Right.\n\nMCGHEE: \u2026graveyard, right and sent it into a legislative graveyard. This is the problem with the calculus that somehow, if they just keep passing bills and focusing on, you know, bread-and-butter issues, which, trust me, I completely agree are very important and frankly, I think the Democratic presidential candidates are doing a great job of actually talking about the vision for the world they want to see.\n\nMAHER: Wow.\n\nMCGHEE: But I do think that the media is always going to cover the scandal, so they might as well be covering Democrats doing it right."}}
