Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s stay at home order allows those with second homes in Michigan to travel to their other residences throughout the state.\n\nMichalek anticipates the community is about a week behind what the hospitals in the Detroit metro area are dealing with.\n\nIn a press conference earlier Thursday, Lisa Peacock \u2014 health officer for the health department overseeing Charlevoix, Emmet, Antrim and Otsego counties \u2014 said her team will work to assist the newly arrived residents.\n\n\u201cWhen we have part time residents in our jurisdiction we care about them just like our full time residents,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want them to be aware of the executive order. We want them to have what they need to be able to comply with it and to ensure that they know where to ask questions if they aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPeacock says people can call 211 to get connected to community services, if they need to.\n\nShe says all residents over the age of 65, or who have a chronic illness, should limit trips out in the public as much as is feasibly possible, including to the grocery store.\n\nOtsego and Missaukee Counties each reported a new case today."}}
