The cause of her death was not announced, although she tested positive for COVID-19 the day she died. Her family was awaiting autopsy results.\n\nShe has served as South Africa\u2019s ambassador to Denmark since 2015, and was to become South Africa\u2019s ambassador to Liberia when she died.\n\nShe was the third and youngest daughter of the Mandelas and was only 18 months old when her noted father was sent to prison. She often was cared for by an older sister when their mother also was sent to prison for months at a time.\n\nShe studied law at the University of Capetown, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1985.\n\nMs. Mandela, an anti-apartheid activist in her own right, came to international prominence in 1985 when the white minority government offered to release her father from prison if he denounced violence perpetrated by his movement, the Africa National Congress, against apartheid, the brutal system of racial discrimination enforced in South Africa at that time.\n\nMs. Mandela read his letter rejecting the offer at a packed public meeting that was broadcast around the world.\n\nWhen her father was released from prison after 27 years in 1990 and served as president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999, Ms. Mandela served as a stand-in first lady from 1996 to 1998.\n\nLast year, Ms. Mandela stirred controversy by calling for the return of white-owned land to South Africa\u2019s dispossessed Black majority.\n\n\u201cDear Apartheid Apologists, your time is over. You will not rule again. We do not fear you. Finally #TheLandIsOurs,\u201d she tweeted in June last year.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Naledi Pandor, expressed shock at Ms. Mandela\u2019s death, describing her as a heroine.\n\n\u201cZindzi will not only be remembered as a daughter of our struggle heroes, Tata Nelson and Mama Winnie Mandela, but as a struggle heroine in her own right. She served South Africa well,\u201d Ms. Pandor said.\n\nSouth Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa said she brought to public attention the \u201cinhumanity\u201d of the apartheid system and Black people\u2019s fight for freedom.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa loses an important generational link connecting our divided history to the promise of a better, more inclusive tomorrow,\u201d the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation said in a statement.\n\nMs. Mandela is survived by her husband, Molapo Motlhajwa, four children, a sister, a half-sister, and two half-brothers.\n\nHer funeral was held Friday, July 17, the day before the annual Nelson Mandela Day on July 18, South Africa\u2019s annual celebration of his birthday."}}
