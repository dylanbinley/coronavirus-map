First to receive donations will be the Reno Volunteer Fire Department.\n\nThe event will be held two Fridays each month month as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. The restaurant\u2019s co-owners, Mike and Lisa Walsh, decided to launch the program because many local fire departments have had to cancel ice cream socials and other fundraising events due to the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do at Over the Moon is give back to the community. We grew up here, so we want to give back to the people who helped make us who we are...We want to try help [fire departments] raise some money to support their efforts, which keep us all safe,\u201d Mike Walsh.\n\nVolunteer Fire Department Friday will last all day on each day that it is held, beginning when the restaurant opens at 11:30 A.M. and going until closing at 10 P.M.\n\nIn addition, each week, the restaurant hosts what it calls Heroes Tuesday, in which a 15 percent discount on orders of 25 dollars more is offered to frontline responders.\n\nThose who would like to learn more about the restaurant or read its menu can find that information on its website.\n\nCopyright 2020 WTAP.
