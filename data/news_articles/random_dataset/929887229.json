She said they have raised concerns to relevant officers with little success.\n\nMs Mbaruk said they are facing challenges in getting fish for sale due to lack of reliable supply, which leads to some men exploiting them for sex.\n\n\u201cIn all the beach management units men are the ones who own boats and it becomes a challenge for them to sell fish to all the women since they have clients whom they give first priority,\u201d she added.\n\nCurrently, there are 53 women in the Kilifi Central BMU.\n\nMs Rukia Juma said lack of support has derailed their development objectives since most of them are breadwinners for their families.\n\n\u201cWe have always wanted to grow as women in the fishing industry but we are faced with a myriad of challenges,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Juma said women are expected to suffer more when there is scarcity of fish due to high tides in the ocean, like is happening now.\n\n\u201cIf women had a savings club, things would be easier for us but now, everyone is struggling to fend for their families, pay rent and even service their loans but everybody is stuck since we do not have the capacity to cushion ourselves through our work,\u201d said Ms Juma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
