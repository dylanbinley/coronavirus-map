I'm feeling very grateful for this time we have right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think for Willie, honestly, I'm most thankful for his friendship,\u201d Christina Geist said. \u201cAt the end of the day \u2026 we find each other really funny. We get a big kick out of each other. We really love being together. And that hasn't changed since we were really young.\u201d\n\nThe two met at their middle school in Ridgewood, New Jersey and started dating their junior year in high school. In an unplanned move, they both went to Vanderbilt University. But after college, they went their separate ways for work \u2014 Christina to Boston, and Willie to Atlanta \u2014 and they broke up for several years in their 20s.\n\nGet the knowyourvalue newsletter.

And thank God for me and hopefully for Christina, too: We did find each other again.\u201d\n\nNowadays, the power couple balances two thriving careers and two kids. While Willie Geist arrives at work in the middle of the night to co-host \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d in addition to anchoring his own weekend program on \u201cSunday TODAY,\u201d Christina Geist takes the lead at home, getting the kids ready for school. She\u2019s also a bestselling children\u2019s book author and the owner of two companies. Pierre-Bravo asked how the two press pause on their professional lives to keep their personal lives thriving.\n\n\u201cI think for me, it's about compartmentalization,\u201d Christina Geist said. Part of her success in managing her time comes from working really close to home and cutting out the hours a day she would otherwise be commuting. \u201cWhen you own your own business, you kind of control the circumstances by which you work,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there's a lot of efficiency and just the way that we generally kind of run our schedule, which I think comes from Willie working in TV, because it's such an efficient business, you have to be that way with your time. so that kind of spills over to life at home.\u201d\n\nFor Willie Geist, their success hinges on an \u201cunspoken agreement.\u201d As a lead television anchor six mornings a week, he makes it a priority to be home with his family at night as much as possible.\n\n\u201cI think I've done a much better job in the last few years of just saying \u2018no\u2019 to things at night, making that crucial time not to do anything extravagant or crazy or go to a Knicks game or anything, just like to be home with the kids, have dinner, when they were younger, give them a bath, read to them, and just have that time and know that OK, this is work time all day. But at night, it's time for the family,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that partnership was hard-fought for the two equally ambitious partners. As Willie Geist remembers it, his wife was always a professional, landing her first job before she even finished her senior year in college. So, he didn\u2019t take her decision lightly when she decided to stay home with their young kids.\n\n\u201cThere was a point where the kids were three and one, and I waved the white flag and quit my corporate job,\u201d Christina Geist remembered. \u201cAnd it was really hard because right about that same moment, Willie\u2019s career went on a vertical trajectory. So, all of a sudden, we weren't equal in anymore, at least in terms of our professional lives. But for that phase in our life, that was the best decision to make and we kind of have a way of looking each other in the eye at certain moments and knowing all right, one of us needs to just do this right now. It\u2019s a long game.\u201d\n\nWhen their youngest child turned five and went to kindergarten, Christina Geist re-evaluated her decision and, as Willie Geist put it, \u201cchased a couple of her dreams.\u201d That includes authoring two bestselling children\u2019s books: \u201cBuddy\u2019s Bedtime Battery\u201d, which hit number one in children\u2019s books on Amazon, and \u201cSorry Grown-ups, You Can\u2019t Go To School!\u201d, which debuted at number four on the New York Times\u2019 bestseller list. One of her companies, Boombox, offers personalized memory boxes, and the other, True Geist, is a brand strategy and design firm she founded with a former business partner.\n\n\u201cWe've always been absolute equals,\u201d Christina Geist said. \u201cWe were academic equals growing up. So we have just an innate respect for each other, regardless of one of us being up, one of us being down professionally. I think we both in our hearts know that if all of this went away, we're OK.\u201d\n\nPart of what keeps the couple anchored is stopping to appreciate the moments that bring them joy amid their busy days.\n\n\u201cThese are the good old days right now,\u201d Willie Geist said. \u201cWhen we're older and we're thinking about the good old days \u2014 we're in them right now. So let's soak them up let\u2019s enjoy each other. Let's love each other. Let's laugh with each other. And I think we're in that moment right now, and I'm grateful for it.\u201d"}}
