But there is a far likelier explanation for the ruling Chinese Communist Party\u2019s actions \u2014 namely, the strategy of feints and misdirection that it has honed over decades. The day before the Foreign Ministry\u2019s announcement, the U.S. State Department had designated five major state-run Chinese media entities operating in the United States \u2014 three news outlets and two distribution companies \u2014 as \u201cforeign missions,\u201d requiring them to register and disclose more information about their personnel and real estate holdings. All five companies are indeed arms of the Chinese state \u2014 a fact that China prefers to obscure when it addresses the issue in its messaging to English-language audiences. Speaking in Chinese at the 60th anniversary of China\u2019s Central Television in September 2018, for example, Chinese President Xi Jinping exhorted the company to maintain the Party\u2019s leadership.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut by attacking a U.S. media company instead of the State Department, China subtly and inaccurately conveys to Chinese citizens \u2014 the most important target of Beijing\u2019s messages \u2014 that the U.S. government controls American media.\n\nThe attack also attempts to shift the conversation away from both the propagandistic elements of Chinese state media and the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s bungled response to the devastating Wuhan coronavirus outbreak and toward allegedly \u201cracist\u201d American views of China.\n\n(Speaking of racism: It\u2019s worth remembering that Beijing is engaged in a ruthless campaign of discrimination against Chinese Muslims, roughly 1 million of whom languish in concentration camps because of their religion and ethnicity.)\n\nAD\n\nTargeting those three Wall Street Journal reporters \u2014 deputy bureau chief Josh Chin and reporter Chao Deng, both U.S. nationals, and Australian reporter Philip Wen \u2014 follows an uncomfortable pattern of racial and gender profiling that the Chinese Communist Party often employs in its targeting of foreign nationals. The three Wall Street Journal reporters brings the known cases of foreign journalists de facto expelled by Beijing over the last decade to roughly a dozen.\n\nAD\n\nAs anyone who has browsed the headshots of journalists at prominent publications will have seen, white men dominate the media. But Beijing chooses to focus on women and minorities, many of whom have Chinese heritage. Over the last six years, it has denied the visa renewals for the French journalist Ursula Gauthier, the BuzzFeed News reporter Megha Rajagopalan, and the Singaporean Wall Street Journal reporter Chun Han Wong, as well as a visa application for Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian, who was supposed to join the staff of Agence France-Presse. In 2012, it declined to renew the press credentials of Melissa Chan, then an reporter for Al Jazeera. (Disclosure: the China journalism scene is a small one, and I personally know most of the people I\u2019m writing about.)\n\nWhy does China do this? The opacity of the ruling party precludes a definitive answer. But I have a theory. Beijing cultivates the perception that it oversees Chinese people globally, regardless of their citizenship or country of birth \u2014 shielding them from \u201chostile foreign forces\u201d but also punishing them when they violate Beijing\u2019s rules and norms.\n\nAD\n\nIn the terms of this worldview, the four Wall Street Journal reporters of Chinese heritage targeted over the last year, along with Chan, should have \u201cknown better.\u201d And, sadly, as the Wuhan coronavirus engenders even more paranoia in Beijing, this situation will grow worse.\n\nAD\n\nSavannah Billman contributed research."}}
