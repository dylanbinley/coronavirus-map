Starting Friday, medical facilities were allowed to open up for medical procedures and doctor visits. On Monday, May 4, general offices, manufacturing, distribution, and construction entities can open back up. Then on May 12, retail facilities can open up fully, but they can open up some aspects of their businesses early if they provide services like curbside pickup or delivery.\n\n\u201cIf you have a retail establishment that has been closed and you can operate with curbside pick up, delivery, or appointment only, you can open those sections today,\u201d Welker said on Friday.\n\nOther requirements went across the board for all types of businesses, Welker said. The state\u2019s guidelines included social distancing provisions, suggesting businesses should try to keep people at least six feet a part. For businesses where that is not possible, they should try to install barriers of some kind to separate people. The order also suggested, for businesses that are able to, to implement staggered work schedules for employees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a lot about keeping people separated as much as possible,\u201d Welker said.\n\nFace coverings are also required for employees, but only recommended for customers or clients. Businesses can set their own guidelines if they want to require customers to wear face coverings, but Welker said that businesses may have to be prepared to turn customers away or provide face coverings for customers if businesses decide to require customers to wear face masks.\n\nWelker noted exceptions to the face coverings mandate, saying if there are health reasons, if employees are in situations that prohibit face coverings, or if employees are separated in their own office work spaces, then they do not have to wear face coverings. One example Welker used was if employees were working in extreme heat, then wearing a face mask could make breathing difficult.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re also looking at employees continuing to do self assessments,\u201d Welker said. If employees are showing symptoms, then they should be staying home. \u201cYou don\u2019t want sick employees showing up to your workplace and potentially infecting others.\u201d\n\nBusinesses should also provide hand-washing and hand-sanitizing stations, as well as promoting disinfecting of work stations. Businesses can encourage employees to take ownership of their own work spaces to keep them clean, providing employees with disinfectants.\n\nWelker also emphasized communication with employees. She said when the state\u2019s first Stay at Home order was implemented, they worked with businesses to provide guidance one whether or not they fit into an \u201cessential business\u201d category.\n\n\u201cThen we started hearing from the employees, and that\u2019s where we got into a lot of issues,\u201d Welker said. \u201cSome employers weren\u2019t effectively communicating with their staff.\u201d She explained they received complaints from employees who did not understand why they were considered an essential business. \u201cWe would prefer all of the employees get that information directly from you,\u201d Welker said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our hope that everyone can open up in a safe manner,\u201d Welker said. \u201cWe want everyone to be safe and do what you can do to work through the process.\u201d\n\nExecutive Director Kathy Sherman of the Piqua Area Chamber of Commerce also suggested that if customers feel comfortable and see precautionary items like handsanitzer, then the customers are more likely to continue to come in the store and shop.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t feel comfortable, they\u2019re going to continue their online shopping,\u201d Sherman said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very confident in our business community that we can do this and do it safely,\u201d Welker said.\n\nThe Troy Area Chamber of Commerce hosted Health Commissioner Dennis Propes of the Miami County Public Health Department, along with Jane Tomcisin, director of Environmental Health for the department via a conference call Friday.\n\nPropes and Tomcisin also went over the face mask covering and sanitation requirements for businesses looking to open in the first phase of the state\u2019s reopening schedule.\n\n\u201cWe, at Miami County Public Health, do our best to try to help our businesses function in this environment,\u201d Tomcisin said. \u201cOur main concern, obviously, is the safety of our community, the safety of you, the safety of your staff, and the safety of your customers, so we follow the orders.\u201d\n\nTomcisin noted that whenever there are questions regarding orders from the state, the MCPHD contacts the Ohio Department of Health to obtain further interpretation and clarification, and also communicates regularly with local health officials.\n\n\u201cFrom an Environmental Health Director\u2019s standpoint, we have a group of environmental health directors in our area that we talk with almost daily about some of these orders and how they\u2019re handling it in their counties, as well,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to ensure that we have consistency around our area and around our regions.\u201d\n\nTomcisin and Propes also addressed questions, which were submitted to the Troy Area Chamber prior to Friday\u2019s call.\n\nOne question was asked regarding curbside pick-up and when retailers are allowed to provide the service.\n\n\u201cThe orders indicate that currently-closed retail establishments and facilities that will restrict their operations to curbside pick-up, delivery, or appointment only \u2014 and that\u2019s limited to 10 customers at any time \u2014 may reopen effective May 1 at 11:59 p.m.,\u201d Tomcisin said.\n\nAnother question was regarding clothing stores and whether or not they will be able to allow customers to try pieces of clothing on prior to purchase.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for some guidance on that,\u201d Propes said. \u201cI think the restriction of trying on clothing at this time and limiting that as best you can would be the best course of action.\u201d\n\nTomcisin noted that many stores are extending their return windows on products.\n\nWith regard to the state\u2019s mandates and orders, Propes said the health department is not \u201cgoing out and policing people,\u201d but will follow up with any complaints.\n\n\u201cOur role is to ensure that our businesses know what to do, know how to respond, and know how to keep their employees and customers safe,\u201d Tomcisin said."}}
