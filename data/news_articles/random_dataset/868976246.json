The Mexican restaurant, which is located at 1306 Wapakoneta Ave. in Sidney, previously was called Las Tapatias.\n\n\u201cIt somewhat represents our culture because of the drink, of course,\u201d Lopez said of changing the name of the restaurant to Mojitos. \u201cAnd people can relate to it; they can understand it. By hearing Mojitos, they know it\u2019s Hispanic.\u201d\n\nThe cousins have made numerous changes at the restaurant since they purchased it in March. Their menus have been updated with new dishes and are adorned with sugar skulls, which are common in Mexican art and celebrations.\n\n\u201cThey are used in our culture a lot, in Mexico,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t represent death or nothing like that. It\u2019s nothing with like black magic and stuff. In Mexico, in our culture, we use them to actually represent happiness and life because the skull is always smiling. And, yeah, we like the theme, the flowers with the sugar skulls and all that and all the colors. We like that theme, and we feel like people can relate to it and know that it\u2019s going to be something not just Hispanic but like Mexican because of that.\u201d\n\nTheir food is inspired by traditional Mexican cuisine and all freshly prepared.\n\n\u201cYou get to create a relationship with a customer, and that relationship gives you feedback and educates them on what real, authentic Mexican food is, and at the same time they tell you how they like it so you kind of meet in the middle,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cThanks to them we\u2019ve made new plates that in a way they\u2019re still Mexican, you still find it there, but it\u2019s been shaped to where more people can enjoy it.\u201d\n\nOne of the most popular dishes has been the melting chimichanga, their take on a deep-fried burrito.\n\n\u201cSince we put it in this town, everybody says this is the house of the melting chimichanga because nobody around made the chimichanga like us because it\u2019s kind of grilled but deep fried,\u201d Fuentes said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good one.\u201d\n\nThe camarones al ajillo, a shrimp dish, also has been popular. And Mojitos has made sure to promote a variety of tacos.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows tacos, and they\u2019re looking for tacos,\u201d Fuentes said.\n\nWhile they\u2019re first-time business owners, Lopez and Fuentes are well versed in cooking and working in restaurants. Their parents and grandparents owned Mexican and Tex-Mex restaurants that they grew up around and worked in for years.\n\nLopez, who was born and raised in California, worked in restaurants in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, California and Virginia. He\u2019s managed restaurants for the past seven years, starting when he was 18.\n\nFuentes was born in Chicago but spent most of his childhood in Mexico. He\u2019s worked in restaurants in Cleveland, Boston, Iowa and Nashville, Tennessee, for the past nine years, beginning when he was 14.\n\n\u201cI always loved to be in the kitchen helping my family,\u201d Fuentes said.\n\nTheir years of experience make them confident that they can make Mojitos a popular spot in Sidney.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked in every position,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cWe started off with our parents pretty much dishwashing, went up to like running the kitchen. Out here we started cleaning tables, taking chips out for the people as hosts, and we\u2019ve worked our way up and learned everything about it to the point where we can run our own business thanks to our parents and our family because they introduced us when we were little so we got the hang of it real quick.\u201d\n\nThe cousins came to Shelby County when Las Tapatias became available to purchase and have enjoyed their time in Sidney.\n\n\u201cWe like it here,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cWe like the people. It\u2019s a nice town. We get along with everybody. We\u2019ve met a lot of friends in the few months that we\u2019ve been here.\u201d\n\nFuentes and Lopez value the feedback they\u2019ve received from patrons, which has helped them craft their recipes into dishes that appeal to people in Sidney.\n\n\u201cWe can create our own plates,\u201d Fuentes said of owning a restaurant. \u201cWe can come up with something pretty nice. And we like to experiment with our plates, you know, to come up with something for the community over here that everybody is going to like it.\u201d\n\nTo get the best possible flavors, they said, everything is made in the restaurant with fresh ingredients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to just give the best quality we can with the best flavor we can with the best prices we can,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cIt\u2019s affordable for everybody and yet it\u2019s good for them, it\u2019s tasty.\u201d\n\nAmong the best parts of owning a restaurant, they said, is getting to share their culture and their own personalities in their dishes.\n\n\u201cI feel like you have more freedom to be yourself, to express yourself with the plates you offer,\u201d Lopez said.\n\nThey also enjoy interacting with their customers and having fun with them.\n\n\u201cI like to be friendly with a lot of people so always when I\u2019m here I\u2019m always talking with people, drinking or like having a conversation, making sure whatever they\u2019re getting is what they want to get,\u201d Fuentes said. \u201cThat makes me happy, you know, having some customers happy. That makes me smile.\u201d\n\nMojitos opens daily at 11 a.m. It is open until 9:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday, until 10 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and until 8:30 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nFor more information, visit the restaurant at 1306 Wapakoneta Ave. in Sidney or call 937-507-9210.\n\nOwner-operators Juan Lopez, second from left, and Jonathan Fuentes, third from left, talk with President of the Sidney-Shelby County Chamber of Commerce Jeff Raible, left, and Sidney Mayor Mike Barhorst, right, during a ribbon cutting ceremony for Las Tapatias on April 30.
