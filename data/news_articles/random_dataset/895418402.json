Subair and Muslim Students Federation national president T.P. Ashrafali, called on the bereaved families.\n\nThe delegation found that all the dead had been shot in the chest or the head. \u201cThe mind is frozen. Mahmoud Mohsin was 28 and an ordinary labourer. Two children aged three and six months have been orphaned. How can you console the orphaned children?\u201d asked Subair.\n\nThe team said Asif Mohammed, 28, of Feroz Nagar was shot in the head while standing in a shop next to his home. He is survived by three children and his wife who is expecting.\n\n\u201cAleem Ansari, 24, was shot in the chest on his way back to home from his shop where he made bread to feed his children. There was no word to console Aleem\u2019s father, the 86-years-old Habib Hasan who hugged us and burst into tears,\u201d Subair added.\n\nThe delegation said the protest on Hapur Road in Meerut on December 20 was completely peaceful.\n\n\u201cThe Yogi police are repeating the lie that the police have not fired,\u201d Subair said. The delegation resolved that legal battle must be fought vigorously. \u201cA group of Muslim League-backed lawyers are ready to provide legal assistance under the supervision of the Meerut City Muslim League. All our support is assured. We will consult the party leadership to help the orphaned families. Party leaders and MPs will be made aware of what we found out,\u201d Subair said.\n\nThe other members of the delegation were Youth League national vice-president V.K. Faisal Babu, secretary Sajjad Akhtar and executive member Shibu Meeran."}}
