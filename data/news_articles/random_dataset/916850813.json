The mayor said there were currently no resources to test residents at other care homes.\n\n\u201cOur hospital has nothing,\u201d Esteves told Portuguese broadcaster RTP.\n\nDGS could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nPortugal has reported 11,730 confirmed cases of the virus so far, with 311 deaths. Dozens of care homes across the country have already seen many residents and workers affected and several deaths, mainly in the north.\n\nVisits to homes were banned nationwide after Portugal declared a state of emergency on March 18, which was extended on Thursday by 15 days, and health authorities urged homes to come up with their own contingency plans.\n\nCare home workers fear a situation similar to that in neighboring Spain, where soldiers sent to disinfect nursing homes found elderly people dead in their beds."}}
