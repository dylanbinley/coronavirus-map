During an inaugural ceremony on Thursday, new Chancellor Andrew Martin made a big splash by announcing the new WashU Pledge financial aid program.\n\n\u201cWe are making this WashU pledge first because it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d says Martin. That means we have a unique responsibility to provide opportunity for students in our extended region \u2014 to the four corners of Missouri and our neighbors in the southern portion of Illinois. By doing so, we\u2019re attracting our very best and brightest and keeping them right here, close to home.\u201d\n\nWashU Pledge is for first-year undergraduates who are Pell Grant eligible or are from families with annual incomes of $75,000 or less. It includes the full cost of tuition, room, board and fees.\n\nUndergraduate students already enrolled at the university who would qualify will also fully benefit from the program beginning next fall.\n\nRecipients would get the benefit for all four years without having to re-apply for the program.\n\n\u201cOur hope and expectation is that these students will come to the university, have an exceptional experience and \u2014 then \u2014 post-graduation choose to stay in the region to work, start their own businesses, conduct important research or practice their craft,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThis will boost the St. Louis regional economy and deepen our local talent pool.\u201d\n\nWashington University also has the Start Up Grant program that substantially offsets the cost of books and personal items. WashU Pledge students would also continue to be eligible for these grants.\n\nThe university\u2019s undergraduate tuition for the 2019-20 academic year is roughly $52,400. On-campus undergraduate double occupancy housing ranges from $11,176 to $11,650. Many of the school\u2019s students receive financial aid and scholarships to help offset these charges.\n\nAccording to Jill Friedman, Vice Chancellor for Public Affairs, she says the school is paying for the program through a combination of additional funding that has been raised and will continue to be raised and a prioritization of discretionary funds the university already has.\n\nWashU has currently enrolled undergraduate students from 43 of Missouri\u2019s 114 counties and says the new program is a shot in the arm to increase that figure even further.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 \u00b7 Missourinet"}}
