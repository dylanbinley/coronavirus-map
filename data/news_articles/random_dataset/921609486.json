Police Scotland will respond to any information and are committed to bringing us some form of closure.\n\n\u201cTheir investigation can only conclude when Suzanne is found and so I would plead with anyone who knows something but hasn\u2019t come forward to search their conscience and get in touch. Not for our sake, but for Suzanne\u2019s.\n\n\u201cPlease let us give her the burial and send-off she deserves.\u201d\n\nDuring the trial, the court heard how Ms Pilley and Gilroy had a turbulent relationship, which had been ended by Ms Pilley.\n\nGilroy \u2013 who was described in court as possessive and manipulative \u2013 sent her more than 400 texts in the month before she went missing, but these stopped when she vanished.\n\nOn the day the 38-year-old disappeared, police believe Gilroy hid her body in his car before attending a school play and going for dinner with his family.\n\nThe next day he drove from Edinburgh to Lochgilphead, taking two hours longer than normal to get there. The return journey was even longer.\n\nOfficers were convinced he had driven his car off road on that day, and found he had cuts and bruises on his hands and face.\n\nREAD MORE: New true crime podcast to spotlight Suzanne Pilley murder trial\n\nGilroy, now 57, was charged with the murder in June 2010 and eventually convicted in March 2012.\n\nHe was sentenced to life in prison and ordered to serve a minimum of 18 years behind bars.\n\nHe has always maintained he is innocent, but has exhausted his options in appealing against his conviction and failed in bids to get the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission to re-open his case.\n\nWhile Suzanne\u2019s body was never recovered, the investigation by Edinburgh CID focused on the Rest and Be Thankful and Argyll Forest, where it is suspected her remains have been hidden.\n\nPolice have completed extensive searches of the area over the past decade, based on information from the public, but Ms Pilley\u2019s remains have never been found.\n\nOn the 10th anniversary of her disappearance, Police Scotland are asking for anyone with information to come forward.\n\nDetective Chief Superintendent Stuart Houston said: \u201cI am entirely confident that justice was served in terms of Suzanne\u2019s murder. However, it is deeply regretful that, as of now, we have been unable to recover her body and bring a sense of closure to her family.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to revisit this investigation and conduct fresh search activity in the Argyll Forest area, whenever we receive new information from the public. So, with that in mind, I\u2019d urge anyone who believes they have any relevant information, but who hasn\u2019t yet spoken with police, to contact us immediately.\u201d"}}
