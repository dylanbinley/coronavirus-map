Israel will maintain control of all borders.\n\nPalestinian refugees will be given a choice to live within the future State of Palestine, integrate into the countries where they currently live, or resettle in a third country. None will enter Israel.\n\nOther proposals include a tunnel joining the West Bank with Gaza, according to 'conceptual maps' published in the White House document.\n\nThe maps show a series of Palestinian cantons pockmarked with illegal Israeli settlements marked as \u201cenclave communities\u201d.\n\nIn a televised address from Ramallah, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the peace plan a \"conspiracy\", saying his people's rights \"are not for sale\".\n\n\"I say to Trump and Netanyahu: Jerusalem is not for sale, all our rights are not for sale and are not for bargain. And your deal, the conspiracy, will not pass,\" Abbas said.\n\nIn a rare show of solidarity, rival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah met on Tuesday in Ramallah to discuss the peace plan.\n\n\u201cWe invited the Hamas movement to attend the emergency meeting of the leadership and they will take part in the meeting,\u201d senior Palestinian official Azzam Al-Ahmed said.\n\nThe 181 \u201cPeace to Prosperity\u201d document has yet to be translated into Arabic and Hebrew.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, thousands of Palestinians rallied in the besieged Gaza Strip to protest the expected plan. Protests also took place across cities and checkpoints in the occupied West Bank in a \u201cDay of Rage\u201d prompted by the PA, which is expected to continue throughout the week.\n\nIsraeli forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets on Tuesday towards protesters near the town of al-Bireh, north of Ramallah, wounding 12 people, the Red Crescent reported.\n\nPalestinians also voiced their protest against the deal through the social media hashtag \u201c#\u0644\u0646_\u062a\u0645\u0631\u201d meaning \u201cIt will not pass\u201d. Others wrote \u201cDown with the Deal\u201d and \u201cPalestine is not for sale.\u201d\n\nIn response to Trump\u2019s proposal, B\u2019Tselem a Jerusalem based human rights organisation described the plan as Swiss cheese, \u201cwith the cheese being offered to the Israelis and the holes to the Palestinians\u201d.\n\n\u201cA 'solution\u2019 of this sort, one that fails to ensure the human rights, liberty and equality of all people living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea and instead perpetuates one side\u2019s oppression and dispossession of the other - is not a legitimate solution\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is no solution at all, just a recipe for generations more of oppression, injustice, and violence,\u201d the statement added.\n\n"}}
