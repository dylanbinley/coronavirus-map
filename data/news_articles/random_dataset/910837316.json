We fully understand this causes great concern,\u201d said Conroy.\n\n\u201cThis concern exists both inside and outside our organization. We will not provide any additional details around this employee or any other patients. It\u2019s the law and we comply with it.\u201d\n\nAhead of next Tuesday\u2019s municipal elections in Lebanon, home to DHMC, city officials are taking precautions to prevent the potential spread of the virus.\n\nCity Manager Shaun Mulholland said every voter will have access to hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes before entering the voting booth.\n\n\u201cIf they wish to use it, they're not required to, but we'll have them there,\u201d Mulholland said. \u201cThey can pull it out of the container and they can go in and wipe down their area and the pen that they're going to be using so we can reduce that risk.\u201d\n\nMulholland said he wants city residents to know it is safe to come vote on Tuesday.\n\nUpdated on Thursday, March 5 at 7:25 pm\n\nSome effects of the new coronavirus have reached the New Hampshire State House.\n\nOne state lawmaker who returned from a trip to Italy on Monday is now self-quarantined, at the request of House Speaker Steve Shurtleff.\n\nRep. Judith Spang of Durham said she went to the State House the day after she returned, on Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, the CDC released updated guidance, advising anyone who has traveled to Italy, Iran, South Korea or China to stay home and monitor their health.\n\nSpang said she was contacted by the State House nurse that day.

But as travel recommendations and restrictions around the coronavirus change, Marinho wants to be on the safe side.\n\n\u201c\u201cThe regulations about countries are changing so fast that it might just be that I can\u2019t come back to the US, and then I can\u2019t come study for the spring term,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big impact.\u201d\n\nHe says this means the next time he\u2019ll see his family is over the holidays in December.\n\n\u201cMy grandparents are a little bummed out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the biggest concern on all of their minds is that I continue my studies properly.\u201d\n\nInstead, he\u2019ll spend his spring break in New Hampshire with his girlfriend, who\u2019s a New Hampshire native.\n\nSean Smith is a professor of computer science at Dartmouth College.\n\nHe says his department has been interviewing candidates for a number of open faculty positions. Typically that means candidates come for in-person interviews.\n\n\u201cAnd now, we\u2019ve switched the remaining interviews to all virtual in order to eliminate unnecessary travel,\u201d he said.\n\nClick here for FAQs: What You Need To Know About Coronavirus In New Hampshire\n\nFor Klaus Lubbe, the coronavirus has slowed down business.\n\nLubbe is the president and CEO of Bio X Cell, a biotech company in the Upper Valley that makes antibodies for research purposes, sending samples off to China and South Korea.\n\nBut while business has been slow, he says his Chinese partners asked him a few weeks ago if he could find a way to send them face masks.\n\n\u201cPeople are looking for masks here in West Lebanon or Hanover; sorry, but you can\u2019t get them here either,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he managed to find some masks online to send over.\n\n\u201cThey were very grateful,\u201d he said.\n\nUpdate on Wednesday, March 4 at 5:45pm\n\nOfficials at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center say they're close to having developed their own viral test for the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe center's Chief Clinical Officer, Dr. Ed Merrens, said the center could have a test ready within the next few days.\n\n\"Certainly confirmatory testing will need to be done at the state level,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this will allow us to test individuals we think are at risk.\"\n\nNHPR's Peter Biello discusses Dartmouth-Hitchcock's response to the coronavirus with Chief Clinical Officer, Dr. Ed Merrens.\n\nHe stressed that testing will be only available for those who display symptoms of the coronavirus.\n\nCurrently, medical providers in New Hampshire do not have access to such tests.

We want to hear from you - click this link to take our brief survey.\n\nState health officials say they expect additional cases may be identified as they try to figure out other people that first person came into contact with.\n\nThe state says the first person identified with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, attended a social event last Friday despite being asked to self-quarantine. The first patient is now being ordered to isolate under state law.\n\nThe state is contacting attendees who had close contact with the person during the event and asking them to follow the recommended 14-day self-isolation.\n\nDHMC has identified staff who may have been exposed through close contact but is not aware of any exposure to patients in clinical areas, according to a state press release.\n\nUpdate on Tuesday, March 3rd at 4:40 p.m.\n\nIn a statewide conference call today that included more than 1500 people, New Hampshire public health officials offered updated guidance to healthcare facilities and schools on how to respond to coronavirus.\n\nClick here for more cononavirus coverage from NPR and NHPR.\n\nState health officials fielded dozens of questions, including how schools should advise students returning from overseas travel.\n\nRight now the CDC and state public health officials are asking only people who have returned from China to stay at home for 14 days before going out in public. Some schools in New Hampshire have gone further, asking students returning from other countries, including Italy, to self-quarantine.\n\n\u201cJust to be clear, that is not a [Division of] Public Health recommendation that those individuals need to self-quarantine,\u201d said Ben Chan, state epidemiologist. \u201cThe school districts have taken that step. We support the school districts in taking those steps, but individuals who have traveled [to countries] other than China, are not being asked to self-quarantine.\u201d\n\nChan added that travelers from other countries with CDC travel advisories are being asked to self-monitor and report any symptoms to their health care provider. Guidance from CDC and state public health officials on who should self-quarantine could change as the situation develops.\n\nChan said now that the state can do its own coronavirus tests, they're expanding the criteria for who gets tested beyond the criteria the CDC has been using. But during the call Chan cautioned that if the outbreak becomes more widespread in the state, it may overwhelm their capacity to test every low-risk patient.\n\n\u201cLikely, as this epidemic progresses, we're not going to be able to test everybody that may have risk factors and presents with any type of respiratory illness,\u201d said Chan.\n\nChan told primary care providers the most important thing is to advise patients to remain at home when showing symptoms. Right now, four people in New Hampshire are being tested for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.\n\nThe state's first - and so far only - positive test result was announced Monday.\n\nBeth Daly, head of the state's Bureau of Infectious Disease Control, also urged schools to begin making plans for if the coronavirus becomes widespread in the state.\n\n\u201cResidential schools in particular should be planning for the potential to isolate or quarantine students,\u201d said Daly. \u201cIt needs to be a single room with access to a private bathroom, and then considering how you\u2019re going to provide food and other basic needs.\u201d\n\nHealth officials also warned schools to be on alert for bullying of students who have traveled abroad or who are of Asian descent.\n\nUpdate on Tuesday, March 3rd at 11:40 a.m.\n\nThe Grafton County patient who tested positive for the coronavirus disease COVID-19 attended a Tuck School of Business social event in White River Junction on Friday, February 28th, according to a community-wide email sent by the Dartmouth College health service.\n\nAccording to the message, the investigation into who the patient, a Dartmouth-Hitchcock employee, might have come into contact with is still ongoing, and all people identified as coming in close contact with him are being notified. So far, no Dartmouth students have been identified as close contacts.\n\nMeanwhile, four more patients in New Hampshire are being tested for COVID-19, according to the state\u2019s Bureau of Infectious Disease Control website.\n\nLater today, the New Hampshire departments of health and education will host a statewide conference call with schools to offer guidance on how districts should prepare for the potential spread of the virus.\n\nMany school districts have already been communicating with parents, outlining their plans. In the Concord school district, staff are disinfecting all \u201chighly-used surfaces\u201d in the building on a daily basis. In Derry, the entire bus fleet has been disinfected.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., the state\u2019s congressional delegation is calling on the federal government to ensure states are reimbursed for the costs of dealing with the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cWhile New Hampshire\u2019s state and local governments stand ready to assist the federal government, it is essential that the allocation of state dollars to the coronavirus response be reimbursed by federal supplemental funding,\u201d the letter signed by all four of the state\u2019s congressional delegation reads. \u201cThis reimbursement is necessary to maintain our state\u2019s activities.\u201d"}}
