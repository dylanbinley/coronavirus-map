The European Broadcasting Union has again confirmed that it again has \u201cno plans\u201d to invite Kazakh broadcaster Khabar Agency to compete at in Rotterdam.\n\nThe same also applies to the Kosovo broadcaster RTK. In a brief statement to ESCXTRA, the EBU confirmed that neither country would be getting a special invitation. The EBU said: \u201cAt the present time, there are no plans to invite Kazakhstan or Kosovo to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2021.\u201d\n\nLike Australia\u2019s SBS, Kazakhstan\u2019s Khabar Agency is only an associate member of the EBU and so \u2014 in theory \u2014 the Eurovision Song Contest reference group could give them a guest invitation to participate in Rotterdam.\n\nThe news follows a similar statement made last year, where the EBU also said that it had \u201cno plans to invite Kazakhstan to participate in next year\u2019s competition.\u201d\n\nThe EBU\u2019s statement makes it clear that Kazakhstan\u2019s participation at Junior Eurovision 2020 does not mean automatic participation at Eurovision 2021. While the ESC Reference Group could potentially invite Khabar Agency to compete in Eurovision 2021, their statement confirms this is not currently on the cards.\n\nIt has long been known that Kazakhstan has been keen to get involved with Eurovision. In 2017, broadcaster Channel 31 claimed that Kazakhstan would be sending a delegation to Lisbon and would be debuting at Eurovision 2019. However, this debut did not happen.\n\nStill no go for Kosovo\n\nThe statement also means that we won\u2019t see Kosovo make their Eurovision debut. But unlike Kazakhstan, Kosovo\u2019s broadcaster RTK is neither an associate member nor a full member of the EBU.\n\nRTK is currently unable to join the EBU as it is not a member of the International Telecommunication Union. And it can\u2019t join the ITU as that union is only open to member states of the United Nations \u2014 and Kosovo is not currently a member state of the UN.\n\nIn June last year, the EBU General Assembly voted on a proposal that would have removed the requirement for broadcasters to be a member of the ITU. However, a majority did not support the proposal and Kosovo\u2019s hopes were dashed.\n\nBack in 2018, the EBU issued a statement saying that while RTK did not meet the criteria to join the EBU, \u201cconstructive discussions will continue between the EBU and RTK about future possibilities for closer co-operation.\u201d\n\nWhile Kosovo has not been able to compete at Eurovision, Kosovars have competed in the competition before, albeit for other countries. Examples include Rona Nishliu for Albania in 2012 and Lindita Halimi for Albania in 2017. Gjon\u2019s Tears \u2014 who will represent Switzerland at Eurovision 2021 \u2014 has a Kosovo Albanian father.\n\nWhat do you think?
