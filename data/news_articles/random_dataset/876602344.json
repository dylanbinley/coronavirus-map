She wore an ivory gown: on it, scrawled by hand, a teeming mass of human figures. The show notes elaborated \u2013 the \u201cdancing girls\u201d had been sketched by Central Saint Martins MA students during a life drawing class, held at the educational space at Alexander McQueen\u2019s recently opened store in London earlier this year .\n\nFrom afar, those figures appear to be drawn directly onto the fabric \u2013 with marker pen, or paint \u2013 but look closer and each line, mark and smudge had been stitched by hand by the McQueen atelier (every person on the team contributed, inspired by the work of The Stitch School which was founded to reconnect boys and girls to the art of embroidery). It seemed to encapsulate Burton\u2019s work in recent seasons at McQueen: her near-inimitable ability to take extraordinary technique \u2013 comparable only to the most venerable of Parisian couture houses \u2013 and meld it with the homespun, the hand-touched, the human.\n\n\u201cEach look tells its own story,\u201d Burton said of the collection. \u201cThe connection between the clothes is the time it took to make them. I am interested in clarity and paring things down, in the essence of garments \u2013 stripping back the the toile.\u201d And the toile \u2013 the ghostly first iteration of a garment, usually cut from inexpensive calico \u2013 is where this season began: a puff-sleeved dress, based on a dress from McQueen\u2019s A/W00 Eshu collection, originally made in calico, was the collection\u2019s first look. Here, it was re-made in \u201cbeetled moonlit ivory linen\u201d, based on an ancient technique where fabric would be left in the field to be bleached by the sun and the moon."}}
