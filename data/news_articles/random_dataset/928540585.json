The technology is a facilitator for people to be able to do things better,\u201d he said, adding that lessons from the app\u2019s trials on the Isle of Wight had revealed serious limitations in its effectiveness.\n\n\u201cIsolation is the number one thing you need to do that actually causes the break in the transmission of the disease,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is better done with human contact.\u201d\n\nThe suggestion that people fail to isolate after being told to by a smartphone app throws the entire app project into jeopardy even though, as Mr Hancock conceded, it is the only way to track down people whose identities a newly sick person \u201cwouldn't be able to disclose, even if [they] wanted to, [who they] might have sat close to on the bus and don\u2019t know who they are.\u201d"}}
