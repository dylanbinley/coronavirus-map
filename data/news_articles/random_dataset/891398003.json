It is meant to initiate \u201cvarious forms of boycott against Israel until it meets its obligations under international law\u201d and end its occupation of Palestinian lands.\n\nThe French MPs\u2019 move came despite earlier warnings by activists and rights organizations that such a resolution could work to block any criticism of the occupying entity.\n\nIn a letter to National Assembly President Richard Ferrand in October, 39 organizations said the resolution would compromise \u201cdefense of freedom of expression and assembly for groups and activists that must be allowed to defend the rights of Palestinians and criticize Israel\u2019s policy without being falsely accused of anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\nThe resolution would also \u201cweaken the universalist approach\u201d to combating all forms of racism,\u201d the letter added.\n\nAs the French legislators were about to adopt the measure, a group of 129 Jewish and Israeli scholars signed a petition calling on the parliament to vote against the resolution.\n\nThe signatories said, \u201cIt is cynical and insensitive to stigmatize them (Palestinians) as anti-Semites for opposing Zionism\u2026They oppose Zionism not because they hate Jews, but because they experience Zionism as an oppressive political movement.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to France 24, James Cohen, a professor at the Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne Nouvelle Paris 3 and one of the signatories, said that \u201cby equating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, you\u2019re broadening the definition of anti-Semitism too much [\u2026] you\u2019re going very far afield.\u201d"}}
