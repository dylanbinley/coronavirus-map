Foreigners are a bit \"luckier\" though since Egyptian journalists, when unwanted, are put behind bars for months or years. Sisi is one of the worst jailers of journos in the world. https://t.co/Iox8PWdrWu \u2014 Amr Magdi (@ganobi) October 12, 2019\n\nBorri told MEE she was the first journalist to begin investigating the Regeni murder in Italian media in 2016, and for that she has been on the radar of Egyptian authorities.\n\n\u201cMy work has underlined the role of various Egyptian security services in the case of Regeni, making it easier for Italian prosecutors to carry out their job,\u201d she told MEE.\n\nBorri said she was held \u201cincommunicado\u201d for more than three hours until she was finally able to ask a woman to text her father for help.\n\n\u201cI was prevented from contacting the embassy of Italy and my phone was confiscated,\u201d she said.\n\n\"The Italian consul arrived at 8:30am, but was not allowed to hire a translator for help communicating with airport officials.\"\n\nBorri boarded a 6:20pm flight to Rome after failing to get a reason for her detention from the Egyptian authorities. She holds both Italian and Egyptian authorities responsible for her deportation.\n\nShe accused the Italian government of failing to press Egypt to prosecute those responsible for Regeni's killing, primarily due to Italy\u2019s interest in maintaining its oil revenues in Egypt as the leading producer in the North African country.\n\nEgypt has yet to prosecute those responsible for the murder of Regeni.\n\nMEE has contacted Egyptian and Italian authorities for comment but has not received a response by the time of publication."}}
