Republican lawmakers shared her story in Congress: how she went from the center of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Case that legalized abortion in 1973, to decrying the procedure as an anti-abortion activist. Abortion opponents invited her to speak at rallies, and legislators hosted her before committees.\n\nWhen she died in 2017, anti-choice activists applauded her life as evidence that even ardent abortion rights supporters could see the light. Now that\u2019s all coming apart. In \u201cAKA Jane Roe,\u201d an FX documentary filmed shortly before her death, McCorvey revealed that she was paid to advocate against abortion. One activist confirmed this; others have denied it. The film might not change minds \u2015 the anti-abortion movement is well-funded and energized by an increasingly religious Republican Party. But it shows the lengths to which anti-abortion groups are willing to go to fight against the right to terminate a pregnancy. Caught in the middle was a woman who grew up poor, survived a physically abusive childhood and later escaped an abusive husband. She was homeless for certain periods, and was closeted and shamed for being a gay woman throughout her life. \u201cMy heart breaks for her because her ultimate truth highlights the genuine nature of the anti-abortion movement\u2019s motivations and its playbook for women. They canonized her publicly for playing their part while simultaneously dehumanizing her by using her as a pawn,\u201d Dr. Jenn Conti, an OBGYN in California and fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, told HuffPost. \u201cYes, she had agency, but they had half a million dollars and knew she was homeless.\u201d Many Republican lawmakers, like former Rep. Todd Akin, Rep. Steve King and Sen. John Cornyn, have pointed to McCorvey\u2019s story on the House floor. As recently as this past January, Rep. John Rose (R-Tenn.) used McCorvey\u2019s story in a speech rallying against abortion. \u201cMs. McCorvey is no longer with us, but her story lives on,\u201d Rose said. \u201cToday I call on my colleagues to search their souls, just as Ms. McCorvey \u2015 Jane Roe \u2015 did, and choose life.\u201d The documentary, which comes out on Friday, digs into McCorvey\u2019s sudden change of course in the late 1990s after meeting two evangelical leaders, Rev. Flip Benham and Rev. Rob Schenck. \u201cI was the Big Fish,\u201d McCorvey says in the film, referencing how valuable the Christian right viewed her conversion from a pro-choice symbol to anti-abortion Christian activist. Schenck was also featured in the documentary and admits that he knew McCorvey was being used by the movement as something of a pawn. \u201cI knew what we were doing,\u201d he says in the film. \u201cAnd there were times when I was sure she knew. And I wondered, \u2018Is she playing us?\u2019 What I didn\u2019t have the guts to say was, \u2018because I know damn well we\u2019re playing her.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey canonized her publicly for playing their part while simultaneously dehumanizing her by using her as a pawn. Yes, she had agency, but they had half a million dollars and knew she was homeless. Dr. Jenn Conti\n\nMcCorvey was a symbol for the abortion rights movement for nearly two decades, but because she never actually had an abortion and reportedly had little in common with many of the educated, upper-middle-class feminists of the pro-choice movement, they never fully embraced her. Robin Marty, a former reporter and current communications director for the Yellowhammer Fund, a group advocating reproductive justice in the South, said she was not surprised when McCorvey aligned herself with the anti-abortion side back in the late 1990s. And she was \u201cabsolutely not, in any way, shape or form, surprised\u201d by McCorvey\u2019s confession in the FX documentary, she told HuffPost. \u201cMost of the people in the [pro-choice] movement honestly already assumed that,\u201d Marty said. \u201cOur movement doesn\u2019t really do a lot to elevate people or really share power in a lot of ways. So it\u2019s not surprising that feeling somewhat rejected by our side, eventually, Norma chose to take advantage of the other side.\u201d Toni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization for Women, echoed Marty\u2019s reaction. \u201cI am actually not surprised at all by this. I thought she was lying when I first heard it,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cDid I blame her? No. Being a woman, being queer, she had a long, hard road to travel.\u201d Jane Roe\u2019s Turbulent Story McCorvey was born in Louisiana and raised in Texas. She was raised by an abusive and alcoholic mother and got married at 16 to a sheet metal worker, who became abusive when she got pregnant. They divorced before the birth of their daughter and McCorvey moved back to Texas. McCorvey\u2019s mother went on to adopt her daughter, citing McCorvey\u2019s drinking and drug use. McCorvey had a second child, who was raised by the child\u2019s father, and when she became pregnant for the third time in 1970, she looked for a way to get an abortion. She couldn\u2019t afford to travel to the states where the procedure was legal, and six months into her pregnancy, she met Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington, the two lawyers who were looking for a plaintiff for their case against Texas abortion laws that would become Roe v. Wade. McCorvey never did have an abortion, but spent about 20 years working for abortion rights organizations and women\u2019s centers. She identified as a lesbian and was in a long-term partnership with a woman, Connie Gonzalez. Then McCorvey became a born-again Christian, baptized by anti-abortion extremists from Operation Rescue. She converted to Catholicism in 1998 and traveled around the country protesting against abortion. She was even arrested in 2009 for protesting at the University of Notre Dame against President Barack Obama, who was delivering a commencement speech, for his \u201cchild killing.\u201d \u201cWhen I got arrested, I loved it! I felt like I was high. But it was a God high. I\u2019d never been arrested before. But who better to be arrested for than the unborn children?\u201d she told The Guardian.\n\nReuters Photographer / Reuters Norma McCorvey testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee with Sandra Cano of Atlanta on June 23, 2005. Both women went on the record saying they never had abortions and were seeking to overturn their cases that made abortion legal."}}
