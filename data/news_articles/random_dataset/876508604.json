Periodic inspection of newly installed CIPP, using Electro Scan technology, can help determine Remaining Useful Life (RUL) after trenchless linings are installed.\n\nThe RAKWA project was administered by Stantec Consulting and Hills & Fort Construction, with field work completed by Saudi Arabia-based International Aramoon Co. Ltd. (IAC).\n\nElectro Scan\u2019s machine-intelligent probe was installed on an existing Rausch CCTV van, while CCTV inspection was completed using a Panorama camera manufactured by IBAK Helmut Hunger Gmbh & Co.\n\nBoth FELL and CCTV inspections were completed by IAC\u2019s UAE subsidiary based in Abu Dhabi, UAE.\n\nOriginally budgeted to complete 4.2km of CIPP lining using UV-cured fiberglass material and 373 Sectional CIPP liners or patches to repair smaller leaks, RAKWA reduced its project cost by \u20ac400,000, completing only 3.25 km of CIPP and 320 patches, based on FELL results.\n\nFlow readings taken at its central pump station continues to show zero infiltration and negligible levels of salinity (i.e. salt) levels, over a year after completing rehabilitation.\n\nBKP Berolina Polyester GmbH & Co., Heidering, Germany, supplied the UV-cured CIPP installed by UAE-based IAC, with Electro Scan providing QA/QC for Post-CIPP liners.\n\nIn the last sixty days, Electro Scan announced 30 mile (48 km) and 22 mile (35 km) Electro Scan assessment projects in Hillsborough County, Florida and Kansas City, Missouri, respectively.\n\nFELL testing was included in its first U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) consent decree in 2014, and was featured in a major EPA-funded field benchmark study published in 2011.\n\n\"Relying on CCTV, utilities not only risk incorrectly selecting areas to rehabilitate, but once repairs are completed, risk incorrectly assessing post-rehabilitation repairs,\" stated Hansen. \"In fact, leakage rates may be even higher 'AFTER' rehabilitation, compared to 'BEFORE' rehabilitation.\"\n\nSince trenchless lining of a defective pipe will temporarily close-off a customer's lateral connection or junction, a precision-based cutting tool must be inserted into the pipe to cut & re-open the service location and re-establish the connection.\n\nIf the remote tap cutter is off even a fraction, damage may be caused where no damage was present before rehabilitation; creating new entry and exit locations for infiltration and exfiltration.\n\n\"Many leading agencies want their Electro Scan surveys to precisely locate lateral locations and confirm that there is 'NO LEAKAGE' at the customer's service connection, prior to rehabilitation,\" states Michael Condran, P.E., Vice President, Electro Scan Inc.\n\n\"There is only one way for a customer's service location to leak after rehabilitation, where none was recorded before repairs are initiated,\" states Condran.\n\nTraditionally, CCTV cameras have been used to ensure that lining materials are smooth throughout the pipe and that all construction debris is removed, without the ability to determine watertightness, permeability, or structural integrity of the liner.\n\nTo identify all CIPP leaks, prior to acceptance, leading utilities are adopting ASTM F2550 to test & certify trenchless rehabilitation as watertight.\n\nElectro Scan's low voltage conductivity is also the only solution to assess CIPP lining of pressurized water mains, as referenced in AWWA M77 'Condition Assessment of Water Mains'.\n\nABOUT ELECTRO SCAN INC.\n\nFounded in 2011, the company designs, develops, markets, and supports technology products & services for pipeline condition assessment, environmental compliance monitoring, and to independently determine rehabilitation effectiveness. Headquartered in Sacramento, California, the company sells and licenses equipment to local governments & utilities to conduct their own pipeline testing and offers a Technology-as-a-Service (TaaS) solution in partnership with authorized contractors, worldwide.\n\n#astm2550\n\n#awwam77\n\n#cipp\n\n#consentdecree\n\n#cctv\n\n#electroscan\n\n#epa\n\n#fell\n\n#leakdetection\n\n#inflowinfiltration\n\n#usepa\n\n#wrc"}}
