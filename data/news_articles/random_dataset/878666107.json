Entitled \u201cWhat Can We Do About Fagin?\u201d\u2014Fagin being the Jewish villain of Charles Dickens\u2019s novel Oliver Twist\u2014the essay shows that the modern Jew who adopts English as his language is joining a culture riddled with negative stereotypes of . . . himself. These demonic images figure in some of the best works of some of the best writers, and form an indelible part of the English literary tradition\u2014not just in the earlier form of Dickens\u2019 Fagin, or still earlier of Shakespeare\u2019s Shylock, but in, to mention only two famous modern poets, Ezra Pound\u2019s wartime broadcasts inveighing against \u201cJew slime\u201d or such memorable lines by T.S. Eliot as \u201cThe rats are underneath the piles. The jew is underneath the lot\u201d and the same venerated poet\u2019s 1933 admonition that, in any well-ordered society, \u201creasons of race and religion combine to make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable.\u201d\n\nHow should Jewish writers proceed on this inhospitable ground?\n\nThere was a paradox in the timing of Fiedler\u2019s essay, since this was actually the postwar moment when Jews were themselves beginning to move into the forefront of Anglo-American culture. The \u201cNew York Intellectuals\u201d\u2014the first European-style intelligentsia on American soil, clustered around several magazines and publishing houses\u2014were beginning to gain prominence as writers, thinkers, critics, and professors.\n\nMore here."}}
