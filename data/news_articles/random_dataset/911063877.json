Hard-hit Lombardy, where 10 towns are on army-guarded lockdowns, still had the most cases with 288 \u2014 four of them children. But Veneto saw a spike of 28 cases overnight, bringing its total to 71.\n\nIn France, a 60-year-old Frenchman died in a Paris hospital, France\u2019s second virus-related death.\n\nHis case worried French authorities, because he was one of two new patients who tested positive for the virus in France this week who had not travelled to a \u201crisk zone,\u201d according to authorities in his home region north of Paris.\n\nA German man with the virus was in a critical condition and his wife also tested positive, but German officials to date have not been able to trace the origin of their contagion.\n\nOfficials expressed fear of infections spreading since the wife works in a kindergarten and the man had been to carnival parties.\n\nThe man had come into contact with dozens of people, including doctors and nurses at a Cologne hospital where he had gone for an unrelated health check-up, German officials said. Schools and kindergartens in the area where he became ill remained shut."}}
