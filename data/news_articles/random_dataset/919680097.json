Hussain said a state-run hospital meant specifically for COVID-19 patients had refused to admit the two, declaring their condition \"not critical\".\n\nNow Geneva Camp residents were being rejected by another local hospital no matter what their health issue is, Hussain said, as staff fear they may catch the virus.\n\nThe Biharis have faced discrimination for years, as the community is accused of backing Pakistan during Bangladesh\u2019s 1971 war of independence. About 500,000 live in 116 settlements across the country of 168 million.\n\nBihari community leader Sadakat Khan Fakku said a man infected with coronavirus from another camp had also been turned away by a local hospital, and he was now self-quarantined in a one-room home with his family.\n\nNone of the hospitals approached by AFP would comment on the allegations, but Nasima Sultana, deputy head of Bangladesh\u2019s health department, denied discrimination. \"There are 10 million slum people in Dhaka,\" she told AFP.\n\n\"We don\u2019t have enough beds,\" she added, saying people with mild symptoms should treat themselves at home. Advocate Hussain said the two infected men from Geneva camp had been isolated with 20 families, but that social distancing was almost impossible in so crowded a place. He said at least six people in the slum have died in recent weeks with coronavirus-type symptoms such as viral fever and respiratory problems.\n\n\"None of them were tested, so we don\u2019t know whether they had coronavirus,\" he said. Bangladesh has officially said 120 people have died and 3,800 others been infected with coronavirus, but experts say more testing would reveal far higher figures."}}
