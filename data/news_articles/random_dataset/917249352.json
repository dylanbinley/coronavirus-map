In the war Vera Lynn entertained and lifted spirits, and I had two organist colleagues Chris Powell and Britain\u2019s Got Talent finalist Jean Martyn have been doing it as well, so I thought why not.\u201d\n\nMr Hawley has a few songs to help boost morale during the pandemic, they include, You'll never walk alone, Heal the World, and Hallelujah.\n\nMr Hawley had recently won an award beating competition from around the world to become best entertainer at the Luxlife awards. He said: \u201cIts amazing to win it again and hopefully after lockdown I'll start getting more work. It's excellent to have the North East featured in a global market once again.\u201d\n\nHis livestreams have attracted the attention of Classic FM and world famous classical composer Andre Rieu. Mr Hawley said: \u201cThe other day was the highlight of my life when Andre Rieu himself commented on my performance of Blue Danube, two simple but powerful words, 'well done'.\""}}
