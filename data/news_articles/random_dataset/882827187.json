They fought on two fronts: the war against the Germans and the war against racism and inequality. During a period when African Americans struggled tirelessly for basic human and civil rights, these soldiers marched off to war to show their patriotism and loyalty to America. But when they returned from war they realized that, despite their sacrifices, the country still denied them civil rights. The 370th had the distinction of being the only Black regiment completely staffed with Black officers. For its actions during the war, members received 21 Distinguished Service Crosses, one Distinguished Service Medal and 68 Croix de Guerre.\n\nSunday, November 10 at 1:30 p.m. on KLRU\n\nD-Day: Over Normandy This documentary combines archival footage from June 6, 1944 with current video taken by one of France's top aerial drone camera companies, showing spectacular scenes of the landing beaches and some of the most iconic locations in Normandy from D-Day.\n\n__Sunday, November 10 at 2 p.m. on KLRU __\n\nSearching for Augusta: The Forgotten Angel of Bastogne Augusta Chiwy, a black nurse, performed heroic service at a U.S. military aid station during the opening days of the Battle of The Bulge.
