They knew little, if anything, about the life of the 80-year-old Army veteran.\n\nBut they knew of his death, and that was reason enough to attend his funeral. They came on rumbling Harley Davidsons and in sleek Mercedes.\n\nThey walked into the service with the aid of canes and service dogs. Women clasped bouquets of white flowers. Men gripped American flags large and small.\n\nPearson, a resident of Naples, Florida, died August 31. His obituary went viral when the funeral director included this sentence in the service announcement: This veteran has no immediate family and all are welcome to attend.\n\nMourners touch the urn containing the remains of U.S. Army veteran Edward K.

Pearson, a resident of Naples, Florida, died August 31. His obituary went viral when the funeral director included this sentence in the service announcement: This veteran has no immediate family and all are welcome to attend\n\nNews of the ceremony at an open-air pavilion area at the Sarasota National Cemetery spread fast and wide in veterans' forums and on social media networks. CNN host Jake Tapper and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted the information.\n\nFor many in the region - a place with thousands of retirees and veterans - it was impossible to think they wouldn't attend.\n\n'You know what? There's no way I'm going to let him do this alone,' said Willie Bowman, 62, a Purple Heart recipient and career Army veteran. 'I've never met the man. But he's a veteran and he's a brother of mine.'\n\nPearson was born in Pennsylvania and moved to Florida 25 years ago. He worked at a grocery store for a bit, and at a hardware store. One woman in the community got to know him after Hurricane Irma in 2017: Patty Thrasher, a customer service representative for the Collier County Tax Collector's office.\n\nThe storm had damaged the roof of Pearson's mobile home. Water rained into the kitchen through a blue tarp and when Pearson sought government aid to help with repairs and needed a title, Thrasher discovered that he didn't actually own the home at all.\n\nPearson is pictured standing outside his home shortly after shaking President Donald Trump's hand during a brief visit in September 2017.

He was preparing to move into a new place when he died.\n\nMourners reach out and touch an urn holding Pearson's remains\n\nAn honor guard carries the remains of during Pearson's funeral.

Some in the crowd on Tuesday said they attend veterans' funerals at several cemeteries in Florida.\n\nIn Texas, there is a formal effort called the 'Unaccompanied Veteran Burial Program' that makes sure veterans in the state receive full military honors.\n\nOn Tuesday, Thrasher said Pearson would have been overwhelmed by the thousands who stood in the heat to send him off.\n\n'I think he would have just totally been in tears,' she said. 'He's looking down and probably crying his heart out.'\n\nAn honor guard member holds up a folded American flag during the open funeral service.
