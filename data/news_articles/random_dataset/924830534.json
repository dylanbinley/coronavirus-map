They will also be joining in this exercise which will also allow us to have more flights and bring back more people in distress,\u201d the Minister said. Several airlines are discussing the issue with the government.\n\nSo far 23,475 Indian nationals have returned and nearly 2.6 lakh have registered for the special flights.\n\nThe government also plans to develop Frankfurt as a hub to operate flights to and beyond Europe. Indian nationals are also returning by foreign airlines, which are operating to take their citizens back. A flight from Buenos Aires arrived on Thursday morning with 62 Indians and last week nearly 300 pilgrims from Ladakh were able to return on a Mahaan Air flight.\n\nTunisia has also agreed to evacuate Indian citizens on its flights to India, Vietrnam and Thailand for evacuating its nationals and a flight will be landing on Friday morning.\n\nThe Minister also emphasised that the Air India flights were not for all Indians wishing to return but for \u201cthose who are genuinely stranded and distressed\u201d."}}
