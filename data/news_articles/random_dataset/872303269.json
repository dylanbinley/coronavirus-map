After Baby Daughter Denied Citizenship", "TEXT": "This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\n\nA gay married couple in Maryland sued Thursday to challenge the State Department\u2019s refusal to recognize the U.S. citizenship of their infant daughter, who was born in Canada via a surrogate this year.\n\nThe federal lawsuit says a State Department policy discriminates against same-sex married couples and unlawfully treats their children as if they were born out of wedlock.\n\nAn attorney for the plaintiffs, Roee Kiviti and Adiel Kiviti, said their suit is at least the fourth such case to challenge the policy.\n\nIn February, a federal judge in California ruled that a son of a gay married couple has been a U.S. citizen since his birth. The State Department is appealing that decision. Two other federal cases are pending in Washington, D.C., and Georgia.\n\nThe State Department didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the latest suit, which names Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as the lone defendant.\n\nRoee and Adiel Kiviti are naturalized U.S. citizens who were born in Israel. Their daughter, Kessem, was born via gestational surrogacy in Canada in February using Adiel\u2019s sperm and a donated egg.\n\nRoee Kiviti, 41, said he and his husband felt their privacy was invaded when a consular officer asked them questions about how their daughter was conceived and born.\n\n\u201cWe are the only parents she has ever known. To have that questioned by your own government is very unsettling, to say the least,\u201d he said during a telephone interview Thursday.\n\nThe State Department determined that Kessem Kiviti isn\u2019t a U.S. citizen because Adiel, the only parent with a biological connection to her, hadn\u2019t lived in the U.S. long enough to meet a five-year residency requirement under a provision of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, according to the couple\u2019s lawsuit. But the five-year requirement is not meant to be applied to the children of married U.S. citizens, the couple\u2019s lawyers maintain.\n\nAdiel moved to the U.S. in May 2015 and became a U.S. citizen in January 2019. Roee has lived in the U.S. since 1982 and became a U.S. citizen in 2001. They married in California in 2013 and live with their daughter and 2-year-old son in Chevy Chase, Maryland.\n\n\u201cState Department policy unlawfully denies that the Kiviti family is a family at all,\u201d the suit says.\n\nThe lawsuit asks the court to rule that Kessem Kiviti has been a U.S. citizen since her birth and seeks an order for the State Department to immediately issue her a passport.\n\nAdiel Kiviti, 40, said the legal challenge consumes precious time that he and his husband could be spending with their children.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to have these clouds above your head,\u201d he added.\n\nThe couple is represented by attorneys from two New York-based legal advocacy groups, Immigration Equality and Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund Inc., as well as the law firm Morgan Lewis & Bockius. Their case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Greenbelt, Maryland."}}
