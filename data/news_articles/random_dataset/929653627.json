by China to report the initial outbreak openly; by our and many other countries to prepare for this type of pandemic.\"\n\nHe said \"crucial lessons\" had also been learnt, including that some countries - including Germany and South Korea - \"have escaped a good deal of the brutal costs of having to pursue a tight lockdown\" after they were \"much more ambitious about testing\".\n\nOther Tory MPs have echoed Lord Hague's words.\n\nFormer Tory Leader Iain Duncan-Smith has warned MPs that they were \"in danger of losing sight of what will happen, probably to the poorest in society\".\n\nEx-defence minister Tobias Ellwood has told the Commons that halving social distancing to 1m would be \"game-changing\" and should be done now.\n\nAnd, in a joint article for the Telegraph, Carl Heneghan and Tom Jefferson from the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford said there was no evidence for the 2m rule.\n\nThey said it was \"seriously impacting schools, pubs, restaurants and our ability to go about our daily lives\".\n\n\"Handwashing and encouragement are what we need, not formalised rules.\"\n\nBut Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast: \"People will be, I think rightly very unforgiving about a second spike caused by rushing from two metres to one metre, or what have you.\n\n\"So, what we're doing is - right now, properly reviewing all of the evidence and we're aware that other countries have come to different conclusions.\"\n\nSir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, has said: \"It is a risk-based assessment on when risk reduces and the risks are associated with distance, so risk falls after 2m.\n\n\"It is wrong to portray this as a scientific rule that says it is 2m or nothing - that is not what the advice has been and it is not what the advice is now.\""}}
