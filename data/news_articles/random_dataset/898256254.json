In recent days, the opposition leader who drew thousands of Venezuelans to the streets last year only to see his momentum steadily fizzle as President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro remains firmly in power appears to have gotten his mojo back.\n\nImages of the man recognized by the US and over 50 other nations as Venezuela\u00b4s rightful president scaling the National Assembly\u00b4s spiked iron fence, tussling with national guardsmen and taking a spirited oath, shouted into a darkened congress operating without electricity, seem to have riled up his base once more.\n\n\u201cToday he\u00b4s the star once again,\u201d said Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n, president of Datanalisis, a Caracas-based polling company. But, the analyst added: \u201cIt won\u00b4t be enough. He needs to convert his potential energy into kinetic energy.\u201d Much is resting on the 36-year-old lawmaker\u00b4s shoulders: Whether he can capitalize on the new momentum could determine if the opposition\u00b4s flagging movement reinvents itself or drifts into the sidelines of history.\n\nA significant test will come later this week when Venezuelans decide whether or not to heed his call for a new round of protests. Many are skeptical that Guaid\u00f3 can still mobilize large numbers. An estimated 4.5 million people have fled the country, many of them the young adults most likely to protest. Countless others are too preoccupied trying to meet basic needs like finding food and medicine to turn out for a demonstration that might not change anything.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 will also have to rally disparate opposition factions that united to re-elect him as head of the National Assembly over whether or not to participate in this year\u00b4s legislative elections. Thus far, the opposition hasn\u00b4t articulated a joint strategy. Many are weary of participating in a vote with Maduro still in power, pointing out that the current National Electoral Council is still stacked heavily in the president\u00b4s favor.\n\nOthers note that if they don\u00b4t run, Maduro\u00b4s government could gain control of what many see as Venezuela\u00b4s last democratic institution.\n\nAt the center of it all is Guaid\u00f3, who in his new fighting stance appears to be drawing a page from the epic, age-old David and Goliath narrative of the virtuous underdog rushing to the rescue.\n\n\u201cRegaining momentum is important,\u201d said Maryhen Jim\u00e9nez, a Venezuelan-born lecturer in politics at Oxford University. \u201cBut then there is the other side of the story, which is the passion of Venezuelans for a hero.\u201d\n\nGuaid\u00f3 leaped into the international limelight nearly one year ago when he climbed up on a stage before thousands of Venezuelans filling densely packed city blocks to declare himself the beleaguered nation\u00b4s interim president on grounds that it was his constitutional right to step in because Maduro\u00b4s reelection was not legitimate.\n\nThe previously unknown backbencher was immediately recognized by US President Donald Trump and dozens of other nations stretching from Ecuador to Estonia.\n\nHe led a forceful street campaign, but a series of missteps proved costly.\n\nIn February, he snuck into Colombia, defying a Supreme Court order prohibiting him from leaving the country, to oversee the entry of international humanitarian aid into Venezuela. But state security forces refused to let the goods in, staying loyal to Maduro, who had prohibited them from allowing supplies in across the border. Then came a blundered attempt at sparking a military revolt in late April. Though a few dozen soldiers joined Guaid\u00f3 and his mentor, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, in urging the nation\u00b4s armed forces to turn against Maduro, most stayed in their barracks.\n\nCompelled to negotiate, Guaid\u00f3 and the Maduro government sat down for talks in Barbados mediated by Norway that started out promising but went nowhere. A series of corruption scandals involving purported misuse of funds for deserted soldiers and opposition lawmakers secretly doing the bidding of government allies left the opposition decidedly bruised.\n\nBy December, Guaid\u00f3\u00b4s approval rating had plummeted to 38 percent, down from a high of 61 percent 10 months before, Le\u00f3n said.\n\nNot only had Venezuelans grown distrustful of Guaid\u00f3, they\u00b4d also steadily lost faith that Maduro\u00b4s unpopular government could be removed. Whereas in February over 70 percent stated in polls that they believed there\u00b4d be a change within three months, by December only 21 percent were optimistic, Le\u00f3n said.\n\nSunday was expected to be more of the same: A showing of hands in favor of renewing Guaid\u00f3\u00b4s term in office as head of the National Assembly, with some abstention or votes against by factions who are upset with his leadership. Instead, it turned into a galvanizing moment.\n\nThick rows of green-uniformed national guardsmen blocked Guaid\u00f3 and other opposition lawmakers from entering. At one point, he tried scaling the National Assembly\u00b4s fence, only to be pulled down by the tail of his suit.\n\nInside, Luis Parra, a one-time Guaid\u00f3 ally who had been expelled by an opposition party for allegedly taking bribes to favor government associates, declared that he was the new National Assembly president, claiming to have garnered 81 votes of 150 lawmakers present, though a detailed tally has not been provided.\n\nSeparately, Guaid\u00f3 held a session at a Venezuelan newspaper in which the opposition says he obtained 100 votes, including from some of his skeptics.\n\nWhen Parra tried to hold a session Tuesday, Guaid\u00f3 and a caravan of lawmaker supporters stormed past national guardsmen and forcibly entered the legislative building, sending the Maduro-backed leaders inside scrambling.\n\n\u201cToday, lawmakers delivered a victory for the Venezuelan people,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 said triumphantly.\n\nBut how long might it last?\n\nIn some ways, little or nothing has changed: Maduro still has control of the military and the backing of powerful institutions like the Supreme Court, while Guaid\u00f3 leads a largely powerless institution with no ability to enforce its proposals.\n\n\u201cOnce the dust is settled, he\u00b4ll continue to face the same challenges,\u201d said Diego Moya Ocampos, a political risk analyst.\n\nIn one potentially telling sign, there have been no spontaneous protests in Sunday\u00b4s aftermath, suggesting that the public\u00b4s anger over Maduro\u00b4s attempted power grab could be limited, or at least still too focused on other pressing matters.\n\nStill, Moya Ocampos said he expects to see more forceful Guaid\u00f3 in the days head, exercising stronger rhetoric. Guaid\u00f3\u00b4s decision to leave the party of his mentor, Voluntad Popular, could also free him up to take bolder moves.\n\n\u201cI think we are going to see a more independent Guaid\u00f3, more autonomous in his actions and regaining momentum,\u201d Moya Ocampos said.\n\nGuaid\u00f3\u2019s most powerful ally \u2013 the United States \u2013 also seemed to signal Thursday that it was willing to take a slightly different approach. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that a \u201cswift negotiated transition\u201d would be ideal and outlined conditions for guaranteeing a fair legislative election. There was no mention of Maduro, who the US has insisted needs to step down as part of any transition."}}
