In Indonesia one year ago, the plane plunged into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff, killing all 189 passengers and crew on board. In Ethiopia earlier this year, a similar crash killed all 157 people aboard.\n\nGovernment regulators including those in China, Canada and the United States banned the jet from flying in their airspace after both crashes were linked to the same automation system, effectively grounding the Max. U.S. lawmakers now want answers about what went wrong and how to fix the regulatory system to avert another crash.\n\n1. Boeing\u2019s in the hot seat. But so is the FAA.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMembers of Congress are attacking Boeing for purportedly withholding information showing that the plane wasn\u2019t entirely safe. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) accused Muilenburg of telling \u201chalf-truths over and over again,\u201d asking Boeing if it withheld details about the Max\u2019s design flaws. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said Boeing had engaged in a \u201cpattern of deliberate concealment\u201d and sold what amounted to a \u201cflying coffin.\u201d And Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) said Boeing\u2019s design approach suggested \u201ca disturbing level of casualness and flippancy,\u201d calling both crashes \u201centirely avoidable.\u201d\n\nBut the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 the government agency that certifies new jets \u2014 is also in the hot seat. That\u2019s because of its program called Organization Designation Authorization. The program \u2014 which dates to the 1920s \u2014 was implemented to make government agencies more responsive to private companies. ODA effectively deputizes Boeing employees to perform and approve inspections that would previously have been done by FAA staff. But The Washington Post has reported problems with the program since 2006.\n\nAlthough Boeing says ODA has improved air safety, Blumenthal charged that delegating safety work to the manufacturers being overseen put \u201cthe fox in charge of the henhouse.\u201d Some safety organizations warned in 2004 that the ODA would, \u201cin time lower the safety of the flying public.\u201d Other government officials have also faulted the FAA, saying it abandoned the oversight needed to ensure air safety.\n\n2. Politicians are walking an electoral tightrope.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile lawmakers have voiced outrage over the crashes, they remain split on how to respond. Democrats such as Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (Ore.), who heads the House Transportation Committee, want to change how airplanes are certified, arguing that the government needs to be more involved in reviewing safety. Republicans such as Rep. Sam Graves (Mo.), the ranking member on the same committee, aren\u2019t convinced. Graves, himself a pilot, is cautioning against acting too quickly.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the whole story. Boeing isn\u2019t your run-of-the-mill company: It\u2019s the United States\u2019 largest manufacturing exporter. The Chicago-based enterprise employs nearly 140,000 workers domestically and its supply chains extend deep across the country. More than 900 companies support the Max program alone, and those companies are hurting. General Electric \u2014 which manufactures engines for the Max \u2014 says the grounding could cost it upward of $1 billion. Smaller businesses that serve Boeing employees \u2014 particularly in Washington state, where the Max is built \u2014 are also feeling the pinch. And some Boeing employees worry that the groundings could lead to layoffs. This puts politicians, particularly Democrats, in a precarious position. Coming down hard on Boeing may look good to the base, but it risks alienating voters if the punishment ends up hurting businesses and costing jobs.\n\nRepublicans have their own problems. According to the FAA, increasing regulatory oversight would cost $1.8 billion, 10 percent more than what Congress has currently earmarked for the agency. Increased spending is unlikely to thrill the party that promotes fiscal restraint.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans may have some misgivings about the Max. Following the crashes, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said he would \u201cprefer flying on some other plane.\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who chairs the Commerce Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Aviation and Space, said there had been a \u201cserious breakdown\u201d in how the Max was certified. But taking action is politically challenging with the need to balance regulatory fixes against the fiscal and electoral costs incurred to achieve those fixes.\n\n3. Safety matters \u2014 but so do sales.\n\nDuring the hearings, Boeing admitted \u2014 and apologized for \u2014 making mistakes when designing the Max. But Boeing also argued it had followed existing rules. Those rules allowed Max pilots to fly the airplane without explicit training on its underlying systems. Court documents show Boeing sought to limit such training in the hope of making the Max more attractive to airlines, thereby boosting sales. Boeing even agreed to compensate Southwest Airlines \u2014 a major Max customer \u2014 $1 million per airplane sold if its pilots did need more training.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat reveals how pressed Boeing feels to compete with its European counterpart, Airbus. The companies \u2014 which together dominate the global aerospace market \u2014 have long battled for customers. The Max was developed specifically to compete with a similar Airbus jet. With billions of dollars (and national pride) at stake, the Boeing-Airbus rivalry has pitted the U.S. government against its European counterparts, with both sides claiming that the other unfairly subsidizes its airplanes. Recently, a World Trade Organization arbiter ruled that the United States could impose $7.5 billion in tariffs on European goods to counteract the E.U.\u2019s illegal subsidies to Airbus. President Trump called that a big \u201cwin\u201d for the United States.\n\nAlthough FAA regulators haven\u2019t said when the Max will fly, Boeing hopes it will be by year\u2019s end. The grounding is costing the company billions: It has had to halt aircraft deliveries, slash production and pay damages to airlines whose Max deliveries have been delayed. Trump suggested Boeing rebrand the jet. Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers believe the Max saga is weighing down the economy.\n\nIf this continues, it could exacerbate political polarization. A recent study found an unprecedented level of partisan differences in perceptions of economic growth."}}
