But a former Sudanese MP Hassan Osman Rizk found the meeting \u201cstrange.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the Sudanese leader said he had taken this step in order to protect Sudan\u2019s national security and ensure the supreme interest of the Sudanese people. The information minister told the Middle East Eye that Burhan and the few who knew of the meeting had acted unilaterally.\n\nAt the time of the news, PM Abdallah Hamdock, who is also head of the regional bloc, IGAD, was in Djibouti on IGAD duties. He tweeted support for Burhan\u2019s move in what analysts say is a closing of ranks within the council.\n\nFor Israel, this is a major diplomatic breakthrough with an African state with a Muslim majority, two days after the Arab League\u2019s rejection of President Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East plan.\n\nSudan is a member of the Arab League and joined other members at a meeting in Cairo on Saturday in rejecting Trump\u2019s plan for settling the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The plan, laid out by Trump late last week, heavily favors Israel.\n\nBurhan also was quoted as saying that there had been \u201cpreparatory talks\u201d about the meeting as early as three months ago, and that the country\u2019s top civilian leader, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, was informed two days prior that the meeting would be taking place."}}
