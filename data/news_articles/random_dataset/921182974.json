Staying home and staying healthy is the best way to protect our family, friends and coworkers,\u201d Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie said in a press release April 29. \u201cI want to commend residents for doing a great job so far \u2013 let\u2019s remain diligent and safe in the weeks ahead.\u201d\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds this week announced she was lifting business closures across 77 counties on May 1. However, Polk County is not among the counties that will see an easing of restrictions.\n\nJasper and Dallas Counties, to the east and west of Polk County, are also not easing restrictions.\n\nEasing of restrictions began last week when Governor Reynolds announced the reopening of farmers\u2019 markets across the state. Mayor Cownie said providing Iowans access to fresh fruits and vegetables is a good idea but added that \u201cthe farmers\u2019 markets that we\u2019ll see this spring and summer will be far different from the events we\u2019ve all come to enjoy.\u201d\n\nCownie said city officials will meet this week with Downtown Farmers\u2019 Market organizers to work out details. Once a safe process has been outlined, Cownie will issue a proclamation specifying precisely the processes and requirements for a possible opening.\n\nFor the latest information regarding COVID-19 and city services in Des Moines, visit DSM.city/covid19.\n\nYour subscription makes work like this possible.
