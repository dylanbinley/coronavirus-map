Secretary General and the international community to take any action they deemed necessary.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the OPCW\u2019s findings confirmed Syria\u2019s continued use of chemical weapons \u201cand utter disregard for human life\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo amount of disinformation from Assad\u2019s enablers in Russia and Iran can hide the fact that the Syrian regime is responsible for numerous #chemicalweapons attacks,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nChemical attacks on the Syrian towns of Douma and Khan Sheikhoun led U.S. President Donald Trump to carry out missile strikes on Syrian government targets in April 2018 with the backing of France and Britain.\n\nIn 2013, chemical attacks on the opposition-held Ghouta suburbs around Damascus killed hundreds of civilians, many of them women and children, the deadliest use of chemical weapons in decades. The government denied it was behind the attacks."}}
