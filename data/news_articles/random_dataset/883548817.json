The importance of statewide judicial campaigns was underscored by the state Supreme Court's decision last year to declare Pennsylvania's congressional map an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander designed to favor Republicans. A new map imposed by the court helped Democrats pick up congressional seats in the midterm elections. The high court's party-line decision came after Democrats won a majority in 2015."}}
