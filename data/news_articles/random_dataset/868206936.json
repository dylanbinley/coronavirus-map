They tied the knot Saturday between the Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach stations. A minister married the gay couple who held a quick photo session and celebration at the West Palm station before hopping the train home.\n\nWard told the Sun Sentinel he was standing outside work one day pondering a yacht wedding when the train passed by and he \u201cwas stopped in my tracks.\u201d\n\nThe long distance couple split their time between Florida and Brazil before Bandiera finally moved to Fort Lauderdale. They also have travel in common. Ward is a retired ship captain and pilot and Bandiera was a flight attendant.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Sun Sentinel , http://www.sun-sentinel.com/\n\nThe Associated Press"}}
