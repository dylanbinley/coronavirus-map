Vindman explained that he never knew if the offer was serious and immediately declined.\n\nRepeating multiple times that he is an American, he told the Intelligence Committee that \u201cas a young man I decided that I wanted to spend my life serving the nation that gave my family refuge from authoritarian oppression.\u201d\n\nWhat \u2018makes America great\u2019\n\nTwo day later, former national security council expert Fiona Hill, who was Vindman\u2019s superior, echoed the same message.\n\nAlmost \u201ceveryone immigrated to the United States at some point in their family history. And this is for me what really makes America great,\u201d said Hill who was born in England and became an American \u201cby choice\u201d in 2002.\n\n\u201cThis country has offered me opportunities I never would have had in England. I grew up poor with a very distinctive working-class accent. In England in the 1980s and 1990s, this would have impeded my professional advancement,\u201d she said.\n\nShe herself has been described by far-right detractors as a \u201cglobalist\u201d and \u201cmole\u201d of George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist who is often the subject of anti-Semitic campaigns.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s very intimidating\u2019\n\nHill joked about the matter but said she was furious that the former ambassador to Kiev, Marie Yovanovitch, who was born in Canada to parents who fled the Soviet and Nazi regimes, suffered such attacks.\n\nYovanovitch was called back to the United States in May, after a smear campaign orchestrated by Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. Her absence, Democrats say, gave Trump and his allies freer rein in the country.\n\nLess than an hour into the hearing, the president erupted spectacularly on Twitter with an attack on the highly regarded former envoy.\n\nAsked what effect Trump\u2019s tweet might have on her and other witnesses, Yovanovitch appeared unnerved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very intimidating,\u201d she told the panel, after also speaking of her \u201cgratitude for all that this country has given my family and me.\u201d\n\nUS ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, whose parents fled Nazi Germany first to Uruguay and then to Seattle in the United States, grew up in a family that he said \u201cwas eager for freedom and hungry for opportunity.\u201d\n\nIn an editorial Will Bunch of the Philadelphia Inquirer called out what he said was a \u201csubliminal theme\u201d running through the proceedings: that immigrants fleeing oppression \u201cbecame zealous defenders \u2013 only to see a dangerous demagogue threaten to drag their country into a muck.\u201d"}}
