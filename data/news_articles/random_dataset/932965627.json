And students can transfer up to 79 credits to a bachelor's degree in any arts, science or applied science degrees.\n\n\"We have set it up where they can get their bachelor's degree in three years. That's going to save them time, that's going to save them money. How do we do it? We do it because we also give them college credit fo their life experience. That's an important value,\" said Jim Malatras, the president of SUNY Empire.\n\nThe partnership went into effect on July 2."}}
