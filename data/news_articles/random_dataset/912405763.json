This week, she said, traffic has been slower, which she suspects is because of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s busy, but not as busy as two weeks ago,\u201d Overbay said.\n\nOverbay remains optimistic that the virus will slow down and people will regain the confidence to go out again. She believes it is good that people are willing to take steps to help keep each other safe and healthy as she also takes precautions to keeps the restaurant sanitized and avoids the risk of exposure at large events such as festivals.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what else to do,\u201d Overbay said. \u201cWe are going to try to stay open as long as we can. We do what they say: wash your hands, wash your dishes, and sanitize and keep calm.\n\n\u201cEverything is going to be OK,\u201d she added.\n\nIn 2019, Accommodation and Food Services counted as one of the leading industries in Conroe with 4,727 jobs and 263 establishments, according to data provided by Conroe\u2019s Economic Development Corp.\n\nA short distance away from Carmelita\u2019s, Ni\u2019s China Buffet on Loop 336 in Conroe has also observed a change in customers using the restaurant\u2019s hand sanitizer and washing their hands before eating. The restaurant has also started to offer gloves to customers upon request.\n\nJax Ni, who has owned the business with his family since 2003 and has watched many of his customers grow up in his restaurant. Right now, he believes \u201ctime is the big controller\u201d as he continues to keep an eye on the news across the world and within the community, including how it has affected the food service industry.\n\n\u201cAll of the restaurant market has kind of slowed down but depending on the area and how bad it is,\u201d Ni said. \u201cIt is still alright for our area. It\u2019s a small town, so there is not a lot of traffic from out of state or out of country. But I have heard from my friends in the big cities and they say it is pretty bad because everybody stays and does not go out.\u201d\n\nNi, who follows health officials\u2019 recommendations but has not received specific instruction as of Thursday from the government, believes some people may watch the news in China, and not realize the government has different policies in the United States.\n\nHe hopes that it does not get as bad here and that the government will gain control over the situation or that a change in weather will help slow the virus. In the meantime, as the situation continues to evolve, he takes it one day at a time, and focuses on what is within his control, such as focusing on making healthy individual decisions, which he also advises to others, from drinking water to staying home if sick.\n\n\u201cEverybody watch by self,\u201d Ni said. \u201cEverybody control by self.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Some patients may experience aches pains, nasal congestion, sore throat, and diarrhea.\n\nThe World Health Organization has reported more than 132,000 cases of COVID-19 from 123 countries and territories, including from the hardest-hit origin in Wuhan, China. As of Friday, WHO reported a total of 5,000 deaths from the pandemic.\n\nSeveral events have been canceled in Montgomery County and city officials urge residents to remain calm, stay home, and avoid large crowds.\n\n\u201cI will not minimize what we are facing,\u201d Mayor Toby Powell said in a previous Courier article adding residents just needed to take simple precautions to avoid the virus. \u201cCoronavirus spreads quickly and easily. Most people experience mild symptoms, but some experience serious symptoms that will require hospitalization. The Montgomery County Health District is seeing indications that the virus will spread within our county. The number of people who will need specialized medical care will likely rise over the coming weeks and months.\n\n\u201cOur goals are to slow the spread of the virus and protect our medical resources for those who will need them.\u201d\n\nmellsworth@hcnonline.com"}}
