The COVID crisis has cut advertising rates in half, and we need your help. Like you, we here at Raw Story believe in the power of progressive journalism. Raw Story readers power David Cay Johnston\u2019s DCReport, which we've expanded to keep watch in Washington. We\u2019ve exposed billionaire tax evasion and uncovered White House efforts to poison our water. We\u2019ve revealed financial scams that prey on veterans, and legal efforts to harm workers exploited by abusive bosses. And unlike other news outlets, we\u2019ve decided to make our original content free. But we need your support to do what we do.\n\nRaw Story is independent. Unhinged from corporate overlords, we fight to ensure no one is forgotten.\n\nWe need your support in this difficult time.
