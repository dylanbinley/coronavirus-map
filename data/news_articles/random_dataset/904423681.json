After his arrest by the police, multiple raids were conducted at his residences in Srinagar.\n\nSingh was posted with the anti-hijacking wing of Jammu and Kashmir Police in Srinagar and was part of the security staff that had received a group of foreign diplomats who visited Kashmir last month.\n\n"}}
