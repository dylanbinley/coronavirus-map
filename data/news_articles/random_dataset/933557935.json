Kyriakides was also expected to inquire about Gilead\u2019s production capacity and timeline for delivery.\n\n\u201cConstructive\u201d talks with Gilead continued in the afternoon \u201cregarding the production capacity and access to remdesivir treatments for EU member states,\u201d according to an email from the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc\u2019s executive arm. \u201cDiscussions will be pursued at technical level. Given the confidentiality of these discussions, no further details can be given at this stage.\u201d\n\nThe talks followed a U.S. deal last week to snap up almost all the drugmaker\u2019s supplies of remdesivir in the coming months, a move that sparked concern other nations wouldn\u2019t have sufficient stocks.\n\nCountries including the U.K., Germany and Switzerland sought to reassure the public last week that they would have enough amid broader worries about countries racing ahead of other regions to lock up access to treatments and vaccines needed to help end the pandemic.\n\nGilead has an obligation to make the drug available to European countries where people took on the risk of participating in trials without knowing whether the medicine would work, according to Andrew Hill, a senior research fellow at the University of Liverpool. There\u2019s no way to verify whether countries will have adequate stocks, he said last week.\n\nRemdesivir became one of the first widely used drugs for Covid-19 after a large clinical trial found the medicine sped recovery by about four days in hospitalized patients. Later, University of Oxford researchers said that a large study showed that dexamethasone, a cheap generic anti-inflammatory, improves survival in severely ill patients.\n\n\u201cOur main objective is to ensure that the needs of patients with Covid-19 can be met as quickly as possible in all EU member states,\u201d Kyriakides said on Monday after her talks with Gilead. \u201cWe stand ready to support a coordinated EU procurement procedure to secure swift, broad and fair access.\u201d\n\n(Updates with European Commission comments in third and final paragraphs)\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."}}
