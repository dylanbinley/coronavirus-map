(Courtesy Mery Cortez)\n\nMonths of silence from Chilean authorities, who have offered no public acknowledgement of Veloz's death, has led Cortez to question if her son\u2019s skin color is the reason she has been left to suffer.\n\n\u201cThere is no justice for Black people, anywhere,\u201d Cortez said. \u201cThe Chilean military doesn\u2019t cooperate in the investigation. We have no explanation of why Romario is gone. They took his dream of becoming a civil engineer. My granddaughter doesn\u2019t understand where he has gone.\"\n\n\u201cHe was unarmed and part of a group peacefully demonstrating against neoliberal inequalities in Chile,\" Cortez said, adding that her son wanted \"a fairer future\" for his 5-year-old daughter, Maite.\n\nAfro-Chileans were only recognized as an ethnicity by Chilean law in 2019, despite Blacks being long being a part of the country\u2019s history, even serving in its War of Independence, from 1812 to 1826.\n\nCortez, an Afro-Latina from Ecuador, has been living in Chile for 17 years. She has taken up co-caring for her granddaughter with her Chilean partner, Eric Villalobos, 46, and the girl\u2019s mother, Franccesca Escudero, 29. The three have been homeschooling Maite since the coronavirus closed her school in April.\n\nShaky and harrowing smartphone footage of her son\u2019s final moments, which was widely disseminated on social media, is the only account Cortez has of what happened. It shows Veloz laying wounded on grass opposite a shopping mall. A co-protestor, Carlos Soto, 56, who is a neurosurgeon, administered CPR in an attempt to save Veloz. \u201cAll of this took place in a peaceful march,\" he said.\n\nCortez had to call around to find her son\u2019s body, which was released from a hospital a day later. \u201cHis phone memory had been wiped,\u201d she said.\n\nJustice around a similar killing by the armed forces, on the same day and in the same region of Coquimbo, has advanced more swiftly, frustrating Veloz\u2019s loved ones. An army corporal has been in detention on charges of shooting another Chilean protester, Kevin Gomez, 23. Having a named defendant has allowed that court case to progress.\n\n\"We are immigrants, and Romario was Black.\"\n\nCortez has heard nothing from police about her son's death. \u201cNobody from the Chilean authorities has contacted us,\u201d she said. \u201cI can only believe it\u2019s because we are immigrants, and Romario was Black.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Courtesy Mery Cortez Romario Veloz. (Courtesy Mery Cortez)\n\nThe investigation into Veloz\u2019s killing is stuttering. The army has provided only half of the weapons used by 21 Regiment Coquimbo, which fired the shots, hampering the ballistics analysis.\n\n\u201cWe want to analyze the weapons against Mr. Veloz\u2019s wounds, but we also need a special permit to exhume his body,\u201d said Adriana Rojas, a human rights lawyer who is representing the family. Chilean law decrees that funerals must take place within 48 hours. An exhumation permit would need to be granted by a judge, but that usually occurs only when there is a named defendant.\n\n\u201cWe have requested the public prosecutor to ask the court for an exhumation order, but so far this has not happened,\u201d Rojas said.\n\nThe investigation is further complicated by Chilean bureaucracy. Investigators cannot deal directly with the Ministry of Defense, who control the armed forces, and so rely on the Public Ministry as a go-between. \u201cNow we have the coronavirus pandemic,\" Cortez said. \"They have even more excuses for no progress.\"\n\nA regional prosecutor, Adri\u00e1n Vega, said the investigation was \u201cin full force\". He said 40 witness statements had been collected in the \u201ccomplex\" case and dozens more audiovisual and forensic proceedings are pending.\n\nThe Chilean army declined a request for comment on the case.\n\nImmigration has become a sensitive topic in Chile. Recent influxes of Haitian and Venezuelan immigrants have divided views among the population and increased competition for jobs and services. Presently, there are calls for immigration reform in Chile over what advocates denounce as a basic lack of services for immigrants. The process for obtaining residency can take over two years, and many immigrants have been shut out of emergency relief measures to fight the pandemic's economic strain.\n\nJorge Contesse, a professor at Rutgers Law School in Newark, New Jersey, and Diego Portales Law School in Santiago, said: \u201cDuring the current pandemic we\u2019ve seen immigrants camping outside their countries\u2019 consulates begging to return home \u2014 in some cases to places they fled from. That\u2019s a pretty clear indication of what is like to be an immigrant in Chile.\u201d\n\nA U.N. human rights report on President Sebastian Pi\u00f1era\u2019s response to the protests \u2014 in which he declared Chile was \u201cat war\u201d \u2014 concluded there had been \"serious human rights violations\" by Chile\u2019s armed forces. The country\u2019s own human rights institute reported 1,465 legal actions for human rights abuses during the protests, including 6 murders, 23 attempted murders, 206 sexual assaults and 1,083 cases of torture.\n\nThousands of Chileans were killed or disappeared during the military dictatorship of 1973-1990, and those violations are fresh in the memory of many Chileans participating in today\u2019s demonstrations. The president told reporters in December: \u201cThere were human rights abuses which are being investigated by the National Prosecutor's Office and are going to be judged by courts of justice, according to democracy.\u201d\n\nErika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said, \u201cThe burden of proof regarding human rights violations falls upon the state.\"\n\nBut, she added, \"the state has not been able to provide satisfactory answers\" about Veloz's death.\n\n\"In addition to full cooperation in the judicial process,\" Guevara-Rosas said, \"the least that would be expected in such a terrible case is for a representative of the state to come forward and offer an apology to the family, regardless of who the perpetrator was, as well as committing to doing everything possible to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again.\u201d\n\nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."}}
