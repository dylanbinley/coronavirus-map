Three tanks were also captured, it claimed.\n\nThe ministry also said that during the counter-attack \u201c114 members\u201d of the Syrian forces \u201cwere neutralized.\u201d\n\nIdlib is home to several anti-government militant outfits receiving Turkish support. The Syrian government troops and their allied forces have since December last year been waging an offensive to liberate towns and villages from the militants in the province.\n\nTurkey has been manning a number of observation posts in Idlib since 2018, when it struck an agreement with Russia to cooperate to contain the situation in Syrian territory in the vicinity of the Turkish border. Since the Syrian army offensive began in Idlib late last year, the Turkish military has been building up its presence there.\n\nAnkara has threatened to attack Syrian forces if they do not retreat from Syrian territory where Turkish observation posts are located.\n\nErdogan renews threat against Syrian army\n\nOn Wednesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated his threat of unleashing a Turkish offensive on Syrian government troops by the end of this month.\n\nDuring a speech he delivered to ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) lawmakers in a parliamentary group meeting in Ankara, the Turkish president urged Damascus to \u201cstop its attacks as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe deadline we gave to those who besieged our observation towers is expiring. Our demand is\u201d that the Syrian government forces \u201cwithdraw to boundaries set by the Sochi Agreement, meaning behind our observation posts,\u201d Erdogan said, referring to the 2018 agreement with Russia.\n\nLast week, the Turkish leader said that on March 5, his country would join a quadrilateral meeting with Russia, Germany, and France to address the situation in Idlib.\n\nThe volatile province contains the largest remaining concentration of militants in Syria."}}
