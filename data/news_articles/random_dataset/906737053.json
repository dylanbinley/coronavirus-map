Over three years, volunteers have joined professional archaeologists to survey and excavate the site\n\nThe Picts have long been regarded as enigmatic savages who fought off Rome's legions before mysteriously disappearing from history.\n\nThey are described as wild tribesmen who refused to sacrifice their freedom in exchange for the benefits of civilisation.\n\nThey built a highly sophisticated culture in northern Scotland in the latter half of the first millennium AD.\n\nThe name makes its first known appearance in the works of third-century orator Eumenius, and is assumed to come from the Latin word pingere, 'to paint', suggesting they painted or tattooed their bodies.\n\nA picture of the Kings Seat in Hillfort. The Picts that occupied tis area more than 1,000 years ago were a confederation of Celtic-speaking people who lived in eastern and northern Scotland\n\nWhat they called themselves or the language they spoke is unknown, but they were the last people on these islands to trace their lineage through their mothers.\n\nWriting in 731, The Venerable Bede, an English Benedictine monk, said the Picts had come from mainland Europe, presumably Scandinavia, to Northern Ireland to ask for land, but the Irish sent them on to Scotland.\n\nThis indicates the myth that the Picts were given Irish wives, on condition that they became matrilineal \u2013 they traced their family history through their mother's side.\n\nPerth and Kinross Heritage Trust (PKHT) worked with AOC Archaeology Ltd and Dunkeld and Birnam Historical Society on the study site.\n\nWhile King's Seat Hillfort has been known about for at least the last century, and is designated as nationally important, little has been understood about its history.\n\nOver more than three years, volunteers have joined professional archaeologists as part of the PKHT to survey and excavate the site."}}
