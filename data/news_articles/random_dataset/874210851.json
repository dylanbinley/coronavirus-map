(THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick)\n\nReaction to photos showing PM Justin Trudeau in brownface and blackface costumes, released in the middle of the federal election campaign, are having ripple effects in communities around the country \u2014including Chilliwack.\n\nSto:lo Grand Chief Doug Kelly of Chilliwack said he understands why some people are uncomfortable even talking about the issue, since blackface reflected an era when those racist depictions were unquestioned.\n\n\u201cIt was intended to belittle or disrespect people who were black or brown back in those times, and it has the same effect today,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI have children, who because of their mixed ancestry, range from fair to dark, so these images hurt children. I don\u2019t want my grandchildren to experience the racism that I did as a kid.\u201d\n\nThe hullabaloo created since Time ran a yearbook photo from the Arabian Nights themed party at a school where Trudeau was teaching in 2001, has given Grand Chief Kelly pause to think about Trudeau\u2019s big promises, made in 2015 and since, versus his actual performance.\n\nThe PM immediately attracted the attention of First Nation leaders when he was elected, Kelly said, including a platform that spoke to the aspirations of Indigenous people: nation-to-nation status, recognition and reconciliation. He seemed to be listening like no other party or leader in Canada had ever done, so he was on board.\n\nTrudeau also appealed to women voters \u201cclaiming to be a feminist with a capital F,\u201d but in the wake of the SNC Lavelin affair and what it did to Jody Wilson-Raybaud and Jane Philpott, that changed.\n\n\u201cIt was not something a capital F feminist would do,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI think about that guy that promised a lily-white government. He promised the most transparent and open government.\u201d\n\nLike many he\u2019s been disappointed by the way things have transpired. But despite everything he\u2019s not leaning toward putting his support behind PC leader Andrew Scheer or NDP leader Jagmeet Singh either.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a human being, and like many, I am both gifted and flawed, so when I see others with flaws exposed to the world like this, I get it.\n\n\u201cBut I think it means that Trudeau is going to have to decide what type of leader he wants to be.\u201d\n\nWhat I did was hurtful to people who live with intolerance and discrimination every day. I recognize that, and I take full responsibility for it. I know that I let a lot of people down with that choice, and I am deeply sorry. pic.twitter.com/gLetjs6xAa \u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) September 19, 2019\n\nChilliwack school trustee Willow Reichelt also had some thoughts about the photos.\n\n\u201cI have been very disappointed (though not surprised) to see white people on Facebook and Twitter minimizing or downplaying the photos that have surfaced of Justin Trudeau in brownface and blackface,\u201d Reichelt wrote on Facebook.\n\n\u201cIt is not okay for a white person to paint their skin to imitate a person of colour. Ever. Full stop.\u201d\n\nShe also called the attempt to dismiss it because it was so long ago, \u201ca cop out.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrudeau was 29 years old in the Aladdin photo. I was four years younger than him and also a teacher in 2001. I can tell you that the number of times I ever dressed in brownface or blackface was zero. I realize that our understanding of this concept has evolved over the years, but if you are white and your response to this incident is, \u2018Oh for goodness sake! It\u2019s just a costume\u2019 you have some serious work to do on yourself.\u201d\n\nThe only correct response, she noted, \u2018which to Trudeau\u2019s credit is what he did, is to say that it is wrong now, it was wrong then, and we must all do better going forward.\u2019\n\nGiven his actions in consistent support of immigrants to Canada and his appointing of people of colour to cabinet, she does not actually believe the PM is a \u201cvirulent racist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this incident is more indicative of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s privilege in general.\u201d\n\nShe hopes that he has grown as a person.\n\n\u201cI hope that he does some work to undo the damage that these photos have done.\u201d\n\n@CHWKjourno\n\njfeinberg@theprogress.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter."}}
