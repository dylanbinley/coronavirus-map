The whole world would rise up if a similar case occurred in Turkey,\" \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu added.\n\nHe also rejected rumors that Turkey was transporting Syrian opposition members to Libya, after which they would acquire Turkish citizenship in return for fighting for Libya's UN-recognized Government of National Accord.\n\n\u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu underlined that such claims about the Syrian National Army (SNA) soldiers were \"completely unrealistic\".\n\nThe SNA fought alongside the Turkish forces in Turkish-led anti-terror operations in northern Syria.\n\nIdlib cease-fire\n\n\"There are violations of the cease-fire in Idlib, but we cannot say it's broken,\" \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu stressed, referring to recent truce struck between Moscow and Ankara that has largely halted fighting in northwestern Syria.\n\nTurkey pushed hard for a cease-fire in Idlib after the region endured months of battering by forces loyal to the Bashar al-Assad regime and its allies, sending about a million civilian refugees flocking towards the Turkish border.\n\nPreviously in September 2018, Turkey and Russia agreed to turn Idlib into a de-escalation zone in which acts of aggression are expressly prohibited.\n\nSince then, more than 1,300 civilians have been killed in attacks by the regime and Russian forces as the cease-fire continued to be violated."}}
