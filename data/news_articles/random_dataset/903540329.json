DNC Chair Tom Perez is not in Iowa, according to a DNC aide, but has been getting updates from the team of the ground.\n\nThe DNC officials are also chasing down data from individual caucus chairs from precincts across the state, hoping to track down precincts that had not reported their results.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Iowa Democratic Party said that the DNC was \u201cchasing precinct results,\u201d something that they described as \u201csomething that happens after every caucus.\u201d\n\nThis caucus was unlike any other, though, and there are likely more precincts to chase down this cycle because both the app failed and the phone line that that was supposed to allow caucus chairs to report data was overrun.\n\nBill Schoenenberger, the caucus chair of a precinct in Des Moines, told CNN that he got a call on Tuesday morning from someone who identified themselves as a Democratic National Committee official. Schoenenberger, instead of using the app or hotline on Monday night, said he scanned his final caucus tally and emailed it to the Polk County Democrats.\n\n\u201cThey said they were assisting the Iowa Democratic Party to collect the data and verify it,\u201d Schoenenberger said. \u201cThey were asking, not just me, but others\u2026 to get a copy or a picture of the information sheets.\u201d\n\nSchoenenberger said he notified Price and the chair Polk County Democrats that this request came in and that he knows of two or three other caucus chairs that have been called by the DNC."}}
