"Turkey\u2019s president accused Russia of committing \u201cmassacres\u201d in its support of the Syrian government on Wednesday, escalating a war of words as more Turkish reinforcements arrived on the ground.\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to strike Syrian regime forces \u201ceverywhere\u201d if its soldiers come under renewed attack, but Russia hit back and accused the Turks of failing to \u201cneutralize terrorists\u201d in the northwestern province of Idlib.\n\nTurkey has shored up its positions in recent days in Idlib \u2014 the last rebel bastion in Syria \u2014 with hundreds of vehicles carrying artillery and soldiers.\n\nAnd a new convoy of Turkish armored vehicles arrived Wednesday in the town of Binnish, northeast of Idlib city, in a new deployment, an AFP correspondent said.\n\nTurkish officials say they have lost 14 soldiers in the past nine days and claim to have killed scores of Syrian government troops as they try to push back forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nSyrian forces backed by Russian airstrikes have pressed ahead with an offensive to retake Idlib from rebel groups that began in December, despite a 2018 deal agreed between Turkey and Russia in Sochi.\n\nThe offensive \u2014 which has retaken numerous towns and a crucial motorway \u2014 has killed hundreds of civilians and sent hundreds of thousands fleeing for safety in harsh winter conditions.\n\nErdogan\u2019s direct criticism of Russia is a rare move since 2015, when Turkey shot down Moscow\u2019s fighter jet that had strayed into its airspace.\n\nThe tensions over Idlib highlight the complexity of ties between the two countries, whose rivalry stretches back into their imperial pasts and has been characterized by centuries of mistrust.\n\n\u201cThe regime, backed by Russian forces and Iran-backed militants, are continuously attacking civilians, committing massacres and shedding blood,\u201d Erdogan told a meeting of his ruling party in parliament.\n\nHe said Turkey would do \u201cwhatever necessary\u201d to push Syrian forces back behind the 12 observation posts it set up in Idlib under the Sochi deal.\n\n\u201cI hereby declare that we will strike regime forces everywhere from now on regardless of the Sochi deal if any tiny bit of harm comes to our soldiers at observation posts or elsewhere,\u201d he added.\n\nIn return, Russia accused Turkey of failing to honor the 2018 deal, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying the Turkish side \u201chad taken upon itself an obligation to neutralize terrorist groups\u201d in Idlib.\n\nBut \u201call these groups are mounting an attack on the Syrian army from Idlib and are acting aggressively towards Russian military installations,\u201d he added.\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed Erdogan\u2019s claims of attacks on civilians, telling journalists: \u201cWe have differing interpretations from Turkey.\u201d\n\nUnder the bilateral agreements, radical groups were required to withdraw from a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region held by an array of rebels.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry also blamed the crisis in Idlib on \u201cTurkish colleagues\u2019 failure to fulfill their obligations on separating fighters from the moderate opposition from terrorists.\u201d\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Erdogan spoke by phone on Wednesday, with the Kremlin urging Ankara to implement the Sochi deal.\n\nThe Turkish presidency confirmed the call but did not provide details.\n\nErdogan\u2019s threats also prompted an angry response from the Syrian government, accusing the Turkish leader of being \u201cdisconnected from reality.\n\n\u201cThe head of the Turkish regime comes with empty \u2026 statements only issued by a person disconnected from reality,\u201d state news agency SANA quoted a source at the foreign ministry as saying.\n\nA Russian delegation including military and intelligence officials held two rounds of talks in Ankara this week, but no concrete agreement emerged.\n\nForeign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said a Turkish delegation would now go to Moscow \u201cin the next few days.\n\n\u201cContinuing to work with Russia, we are working to secure a lasting ceasefire. But even if nothing results from this, our determination is clear and we will do what is necessary,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. special envoy for Syria James Jeffrey held closed-door talks with Turkish officials in Ankara including with Erdogan\u2019s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin.\n\nBoth officials said the attacks on Turkish army posts in Idlib by Syrian forces were \u201cunacceptable,\u201d the Turkish presidency said.\n\nTurkey, which already hosts some 3.7 million refugees from Syria, fears a fresh influx if Idlib falls to the government and has kept its border closed to newly displaced people."}}
