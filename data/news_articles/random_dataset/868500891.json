Originally sentenced to death, he later saw that overturned after an appeal to the Montana Supreme Court.\n\nIn July, Kills On Top got another win from the court when it struck his kidnapping charge on grounds of double jeopardy. Prosecutors say that leaves him eligible for parole, based on the remaining homicide and robbery charges.\n\nMike Etchemendy, the younger brother of the victim, said the news was a blow to him and his family.\n\n\u201cEvery time this stuff comes up, it\u2019s like we have to dig Marty up and have a funeral again,\u201d he said."}}
