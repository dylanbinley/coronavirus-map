Corporatist demands made by Anglophone teachers and Common Law Lawyers in October and November 2016 have since morphed into an armed conflict when protesters met with the heavy arm of the state.\n\nSoldiers have since had running battles with armed men who seek to make of the two restive regions an independent state they call Ambazonia. President Paul Biya addressed the nation last September 10 and went on to convene a five-day Major National Dialogue that ended October 4 in Yaound\u00e9. The nation is now holding its breath as to what the future holds.\n\nPaul Biya is the fifth-oldest currently-serving state leader by age \u2013 86 years, 243 days. He has been ruling the Central African nation since November 6, 1982.\n\nCameroon-info.net understands that Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia became the first sitting black African leader to win the Nobel Peace Prize Friday, October 11, 2019, an award that will boost one of the continent\u2019s few genuine reformers against his powerful domestic enemies.\n\nPassing over Greta Thunberg, the teenage environmentalist who had been odds-on favourite to secure the award, the Nobel Committee chose instead to bestow its highest honour on a peacemaker of a more traditional mould.\n\nAfrica\u2019s youngest leader was named this year\u2019s laureate in recognition of \u201chis decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighbouring Eritrea\u201d, said Berit Reiss-Andersen, who chairs the Nobel Committee.\n\nWithin months of becoming prime minister in April last year, Mr Abiy, who is 43, dropped a longstanding Ethiopian claim to disputed border territory and flew into enemy territory to make Isaias Afwerki, Eritrea\u2019s strongman ruler, an unconditional offer of permanent peace.\n\nThe subsequent peace treaty ended a conflict that killed tens of thousands in brutal trench warfare during the active phase of hostilities from 1998 to 2000, flared up periodically thereafter and spread instability across the Horn of Africa.\n\nThe deal prompted jubilation in both countries with long-separated families being reunited after the deal saw the border reopened, phone and air links restored and diplomatic relations re-established.\n\nThe Nobel Committee pointedly snubbed President Isaias, declining to offer him a share of the spoils. In sharp contrast to Mr Abiy, who has released thousands of political prisoners and lifted a ban of opposition parties, the Eritrean president remains one of Africa\u2019s most autocratic leaders.\n\nNelson Mandela is the only other black African leader to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, but he won it a year before coming to office in 1994. He shared it with F.W de Klerk, South Africa's white president at the time."}}
