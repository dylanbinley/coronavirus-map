So it can learn from Russia,\u201d Beijing-based military expert Zhou Chenming told the newspaper.\n\nThe Chinese fleet already possess nuclear-powered submarines. But the subs\u2019 reactors are poor candidates for transfer to a surface ship as large as an aircraft carrier. France learned that lesson a quarter-century ago, Zhou pointed out.\n\nIn a bid to cut costs in the development of the Charles de Gaulle \u2013 France\u2019s first and only nuclear-powered carrier \u2013 its designers used two K15 submarine pressurised water reactors as the main propulsion system. It did not work. The huge size of the vessel and the lack of power from the engines means it now has the unwanted title of being the world\u2019s slowest carrier, with a top speed of just 27 knots. Experts say carriers need to be able to hit at least 30 knots to create the headwinds necessary to launch their aircraft. \u201cThe combat capability of the Charles de Gaulle has been sharply reduced because of its low speed,\u201d Zhou said. \u201cIt was a painful lesson for the French.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nEnter the icebreaker project. In June 2018, the Russian government invited China\u2019s National Nuclear Corporation to bid on a nuclear-powered icebreaker project. The new, 500-feet-long icebreaker would be powered by modular reactors.\n\nWorking on an icebreaker with Russia could benefit China as its eyes a possible fourth carrier that could feature nuclear power. Li told South China Morning Post that carriers and icebreakers both require large amounts of power. \u201cThe structural design of an icebreaker that allows it to cut through dense ice means it needs a strong propulsion system,\u201d Li said.\n\nRussia in the past pursued a similar development path. \u201cThe former Soviet Union started using icebreakers as experimental platforms for the development of nuclear reactors to power carriers in the 1950s,\u201d South China Morning Post explained.\n\n\u201cBy the time it was ready to start building its first nuclear carrier, the Ulyanovsk, in 1988, it had already built five nuclear icebreakers. Unfortunately, the carrier was never completed, as the USSR collapsed in 1991, four year before its planned launch.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia has the technology but no money, China has the money, but doesn\u2019t have the technology,\u201d Zhou said. \u201cBy working together China will move a step closer to one day launching a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese navy could possess as many as six aircraft carriers by the mid-2030s, experts told state media. They could be a mix of conventional and nuclear-powered vessels.\n\nSix carriers might allow Beijing to equip each of its regional fleets with two flattops. One vessel could deploy while the other underwent maintenance.\n\nSong Zhongping, a military expert and T.V. commentator, told Global Times that China needs at least five aircraft carriers to execute its military strategy. Wang Yunfei, a retired Chinese navy officer, said Beijing needs six flattops.\n\nThe Chinese defense ministry declined during a November 2018 press conference to specify how many carriers it planned to acquire.\n\nLeaving aside the high cost, six flattops makes sense. The Chinese navy includes three regional fleets -- one each for China's northern, eastern and southern coasts.\n\nDavid Axe serves as Defense Editor of the National Interest.
