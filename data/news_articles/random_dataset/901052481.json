Every single day, it\u2019s the negative aspects of Africa that are being brought out. Sometimes you watch news, which I have stopped watching, and you find Aljazeera, CNN, Sky, BBC \u2013 whichever one you flip to \u2013 talking about something that has happened in Rwanda, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia\u2026 sometimes of somewhere as far away as Nigeria on the other side of the continent. And then when the guy is signing off\u2026 \u2018This is John White reporting from Nairobi, Kenya'\u201d, President Kenyatta said.\n\n\u201cI would like people to appreciate that as much as much as we seek African unity but each country is unique and I believe Kenya is unique and it should be known for its uniqueness,\u201d he added.\n\nIn 2015 CNN\u2019s Global Executive Vice President and Managing Director, Tony Maddox, flew to Nairobi from Atlanta to personally apologise to President Kenyatta after describing Kenya as a \u201chotbed of terror\u201d on a feature story.\n\nKenyans on Twitter were angered by the description by CNN resulting in a sustained online onslaught on the media house."}}
