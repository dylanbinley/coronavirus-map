And one does not exclude the other,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\n\nNational leaders of the EU member states will debate the matter by videolink on April 23.\n\n\u201cIt will be an important meeting, I expect it to give us some guidance,\u201d said Centeno, when asked about decisions regarding a mooted recovery fund worth up to 1.5 trillion euros.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Portugal's Finance Minister and Eurogroup President Mario Centeno looks on during an interview with Reuters in Lisbon, Portugal February 28, 2020. REUTERS/Pedro Nunes/File Photo\n\nNot reaching a deal on a package would count as a collective failure, said Centeno, who is also Portugal\u2019s finance minister.\n\nA deal must be reached within weeks, and part of the funds needed by member states to relaunch their economies had to be made available \u201cas soon as we come out of lockdown\u201d, by late spring or early summer, he said.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s gross domestic product would not return to 2019 levels for at least two years, he added."}}
