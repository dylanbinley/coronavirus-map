Richard Burr, R-N.C., speaks with reporters on Capitol Hill, Feb. 4, 2020 in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nThe Obama administration was ill-prepared to handle and failed to respond effectively to Russian interference during the 2016 election, according to a bipartisan congressional report released Thursday. It noted officials feared getting caught up in a heavily politicized environment and undermining public confidence in the electoral process.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s report said the U.S. government was \u201cnot well-postured\u201d to counter Russian election interference, adding Russia\u2019s cyberactivities did not cease despite high-level warnings of potential retaliation. The report also noted that some Republicans in 2016 were wary of releasing information on the interference.\n\nCommittee members said they hoped lessons learned from 2016 will better position the U.S. to foil another round of potential interference, as the nation\u2019s intelligence chiefs warn that Russia, China, Iran and North Korea remain a threat.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats on the Senate intelligence panel agreed on the broader conclusions of the report, a rare show of bipartisan unity a day after President Donald Trump was acquitted in a highly contentious and fractious impeachment trial. But some members on both sides submitted \u201cadditional views,\u201d including five Republicans who were more sharply critical of the Obama administration\u2019s actions.\n\nIn 2016, Russia carried out a \u201csweeping and systematic\u201d effort to interfere in U.S. elections through disinformation on social media, stolen campaign emails and attacks on voting systems. U.S. officials have made advances in trying to prevent similar attacks from undermining the 2020 vote, but the potential threats have increased and some old problems such as outdated and vulnerable voting machines have not been fully addressed.\n\nSen. Richard Burr, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the report found the Obama administration in 2016 struggled to determine an appropriate response as it became aware of Russian activities.\n\n\u201cFrozen by \u2018paralysis of analysis,\u2019 hamstrung by constraints both real and perceived, Obama officials debated courses of action without truly taking one,\u201d said Burr, a North Carolina Republican, noting many of their concerns were valid. \u201cHowever, Obama officials made decisions that limited their options, including preventing internal information-sharing and siloing cyber and geopolitical threats.\u201d\n\nThe committee noted most Obama administration officials interviewed in the investigation said they had first learned about the Russian operation to steal emails from the Democratic National Committee from the media. The initial reaction of administration officials and members of the intelligence community was that Russia\u2019s activity \u201cfell within the bounds of traditional espionage\u201d and was not understood at that point to be part of a broader campaign, according to the report.\n\nThe top Democrat on the committee, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, said in a statement that there were many flaws with the U.S. response to the 2016 attack, \u201cbut it\u2019s worth noting that many of those were due to problems with our own system \u2013 problems that can and should be corrected.\u201d He said he was particularly concerned that the fear raised by the Obama administration, that warning the public of a foreign attack could backfire politically, \u201cis still present in our hyper-partisan environment.\u201d\n\nFive GOP senators on the panel wrote in an addendum that the report \u201cexposes in great detail the Obama administration\u2019s inept response to Russia\u2019s persistent and complex campaign to influence and interfere in the most recent U.S. presidential election.\u201d They wrote that concerns about undermining confidence in the election \u201cdo not excuse the administration\u2019s failures.\u201d\n\nThe addendum was signed by Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Jim Risch of Idaho, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, John Cornyn of Texas and Ben Sasse of Nebraska. The other three GOP members of the panel \u2014 Burr and Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Roy Blunt of Missouri \u2014 did not sign on.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon submitted an additional view that was also critical of the Obama administration, charging that officials did not share enough information with Congress at the time. Wyden writes that they still don\u2019t have access to important records and documents, and that the report \u201clacks critical information, leaving the American people in the dark about key events leading up to the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate response to requests for comment from former Obama administration officials, including former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson.\n\nThe report also detailed concerns among Republicans in Congress about the effect of publicly acknowledging the interference. It said that several Obama administration officials testified in closed-door interviews that some lawmakers resisted an administration request for a bipartisan statement on Russia\u2019s election meddling.\n\nOne of those officials, Lisa Monaco, the former assistant to the president for homeland security and counter terrorism, said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell questioned the intelligence surrounding the Russian intervention.\n\nMonaco quoted McConnell as saying, \u201cyou security people should be careful that you\u2019re not getting used,\u201d which the report says Monaco interpreted as suggestive that the intelligence might have been inflated for partisan purposes. It also quotes Burr at the time describing McConnell\u2019s apprehension that a bipartisan letter could contribute to Russia\u2019s efforts in creating concerns about the U.S. election process.\n\nThe report is the third in a series that the panel is releasing as part of its probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, an investigation that is now in its fourth year. Burr has said that the panel is working methodically to review what happened and has worked to keep its conclusions bipartisan \u2014 a contrast to a House GOP report released in early 2018 that had no Democratic support.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee\u2019s report, released when Republicans still controlled that chamber, concluded there was no evidence that Trump coordinated with Russians during the 2016 election. In his report on Russian interference, special counsel Robert Mueller said there was insufficient evidence to prove a criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nBurr has signaled that his committee will have similar findings, but it is unclear when a final report will be released and whether it would be bipartisan.\n\nThe panel has released two other reports as part of the Russia probe. The first focused on Russia\u2019s effort to target state and local election systems and the second detailed the use of social media to sow division during the election."}}
