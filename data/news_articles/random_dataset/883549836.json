According to the Associated Press, James Chad-Lewis Clay seeks $81,372 in the lawsuit under the state\u2019s wrongful imprisonment law and claims the city of Detroit did not test rape kits related to the case in a timely manner.\n\nClay was convicted in 2017 and spent 19 months in prison before being released in July following reporting from the Detroit Free Press on the case. He was sentenced to up to 25 years in prison based on \u201cDNA rape kit evidence that had languished in storage,\u201d the AP reports.\n\nIt was discovered that Clay and the woman who accused him of rape had an intimate relationship when they were teenagers. That relationship took place around the time the woman says she was raped by an armed man.\n\nA judge eventually threw out the case and freed Clay from prison."}}
