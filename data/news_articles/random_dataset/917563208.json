The thrill of being in law enforcement was why he wanted to pursue it as a career. One day, when he was with a buddy of his, an ad came over the radio for a police officer job. He told his friend that\u2019s what he wanted to do, but he knew his wife, Sherry, wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of the idea.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d only been married about a year, and one of my best friends at the time told my wife, \u2018You know, let him go take the test \u2014 what\u2019s his chances of getting hired? Let him get it out of his system, and then he can get on with things,'\u201d Clements said.\n\nThe 21-year-old Clements tested to be on the department with more than 400 other people who had the same goal. Out of the group, he finished sixth, he said.\n\n\u201cShe (Sherry) saw how happy I was and decided not to say no,\u201d he said.\n\nClements has held various titles since being hired in his hometown\u2019s police department. Some of his responsibilities included working as a patrol officer, in SWAT and as dispatch lieutenant. It was when he was lieutenant over the 911 Center that he attended the FBI National Academy in 2004. He said it\u2019s a three-month school that less than 1% of all law enforcement officers get to participate in.\n\n\u201cThe academy has chapters and \u2026 for our chapter because of how small Idaho and Montana are, it\u2019s a single chapter \u2026 out of our chapter, we only get two seats in every academy class, so one officer from Idaho and one officer from Montana get to go to each session,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you\u2019re on the list, it takes a while to get there, and a lot of guys who are on the list forever, don\u2019t get to go.\u201d\n\nOverall, the majority of Clement\u2019s career was spent training other officers, he said. He was assigned to train four different times \u2014 twice as sergeant and twice as lieutenant. Each assignment lasted about three or four years.\n\nClements was promoted to captain in 2012. He served as services captain, patrol captain and he finished as the executive captain directly under Chief Bryan Johnson, who started in August 2017.\n\nJohnson said when he arrived, Clements was the senior leader of the police department.\n\n\u201cHe helped keep everything together and really just did a great job,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHis fingerprints are all over the department, and his legacy will last for years and years and years.\u201d\n\nThe good Clements did in the community as a first responder is what he said the job is all about. He said he was even invited to the wedding of someone he had arrested.\n\n\u201cYou go out, and you\u2019re going to look to solve problems, to serve those people, figure out what it is that they need and work to provide that. If you do that, then the profession is amazingly rewarding,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do those things and you start looking more inward \u2026 it\u2019s a very hard profession.\u201d\n\nAlthough being in law enforcement is something he said is stressful and the \u201cunderbelly of society\u201d is revealed, Clements wouldn\u2019t trade his time with Idaho Falls for a thing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss the profession severely, but it was everything I wanted it to be and then some. I got to do things that I had no idea I was going to be able to do,\u201d Clements said. \u201cIt was everything as advertised.\u201d"}}
