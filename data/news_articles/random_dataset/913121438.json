The decision should allow both doctors and patients more flexibility about how to connect \u2013 and use free services instead of paying for those that have gone through the rigorous process of guaranteeing they're following Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) rules that govern patients' health information.\n\nAD\n\nBut this raises the risk that doctors will use video services without full encryption protections or that companies will store data from the chats in insecure ways. Hackers, preparing for an influx of digital visits, could compromise doctors\u2019 computers to snoop on and record medical consultations. The risk is especially high for top government officials and executives who probably are already being tracked by foreign intelligence services that know which doctors they visit and are eager to find information that they could use to blackmail or extort them.\n\nCybersecurity experts pointed to the relaxed requirements as just another way in which the government is accepting digital risks that would have seemed too dangerous just weeks ago \u2013 but that now look minor compared to the public health benefit of keeping people separated to prevent the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe most important thing now is diagnosing people and getting ahead of the virus,\u201d Mick Baccio, a former cybersecurity official at the Obama White House and for the Pete Buttigieg presidential campaign, told me. \u201cOrdinarily, I\u2019d say, \u2018No, don\u2019t do this. It introduces too much risk.\u2019 But, given what we all woke up to the last few weeks, it makes sense.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump described the goal of this and other measures during a news conference as \u201csav[ing] the maximum number of lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything else is going to come back. A life is never going to come back,\u201d he said. The White House is also urging states to expand telemedicine options for their residents.\n\nAD\n\nThe shift applies to any doctor-patient consultation, whether it\u2019s about diagnosing coronavirus infections or for a general medical problem, such as a sprained ankle, a dental consultation or a therapy visit. But it specifically bars doctors from using apps that default to broadcasting video publicly such as Facebook Live, Twitch and TikTok.\n\nAnd this is just one example of government's increased willingness to accept digital risk during the pandemic. Large numbers of federal employees, for example, are also now working remotely and relying on outdated virtual private network systems that could buckle under the load. They\u2019re also likely dialing into government networks using personal laptops and other devices that haven\u2019t been fully vetted by cybersecurity professionals and could be more vulnerable to hacking.\n\nEven before the government order, custom-designed apps for online medical consultations were already seeing a spike in usage from people wary of visiting a doctor in person, Jon Pearce, CEO of the telemedicine firm Zipnosis, told Tonya.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a 100-fold increase in utilization this past week [and] have not had cybersecurity incidents,\u201d he said.\n\nThe administration also urged doctors to \u201cnotify patients that these third-party applications potentially introduce privacy risks\u201d and notes that \u201cproviders should enable all available encryption and privacy modes.\u201d\n\nCybersecurity experts, however, recommended that doctors focus on using apps such as Apple\u2019s iMessage and Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp that have superstrong encryption as a default rather than walking patients through how to enable the protections.\n\n\u201cI think about telling my elderly aunts how to enable encryption before a video chat and they\u2019d say, \u2018What does that mean?\u2019 \u201d Tony Cole, chief technology officer at the cybersecurity firm Attivo Networks, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s better to have very strong security built in.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nApple, Google and Facebook didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment about whether the White House consulted them before releasing the relaxed rules or whether they would be sharing any specific guidance or best practices with doctors.\n\nYou are reading The Cybersecurity 202 , our must-read newsletter on cybersecurity policy news.

Barr told the Associated Press's Michael Balsamo.\n\nThe Justice Department is investigating the spread of an SMS-based disinformation campaign claiming that Trump would implement a national quarantine as well as a possible attack meant to knock out computer networks at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with something like a denial of service attack on HHS during a pandemic, that\u2019s a very grave action for another country to take,\u201d Barr told Michael.\n\nHe did not speculate about which country was behind the attack.\n\nThe misinformation campaign appeared to be aimed at spurring shoppers to rush to stores, emptying shelves and disrupting the food supply. Both national security officials and Trump debunked the rapidly spreading conspiracy.\n\nThe attorney general also slammed efforts by scammers to profit off coronavirus concerns. Barr urged U.S. attorneys to prioritize prosecuting people for scams and cybercrimes related to the pandemic in a memo Monday.\n\nAD\n\nPATCHED: Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez is urging states to increase voting by mail and to expand polling hours to prevent more states from delaying their primaries, my colleagues Michael Scherer and Felicia Sonmez wrote in our live blog. The call came as three states held presidential primaries last night despite mounting public health concerns but Ohio delayed its contest.\n\nAD\n\nPerez joins a chorus of Democratic lawmakers who have pushed for expanded vote-by-mail in light of public-health concerns stoked by the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 and despite concerns it would be difficult to make the shift securely before the November contest.\n\nThe calls come as election officials are scrambling to respond to the pandemic and as multiple states have rescheduled their primary elections amid public health concerns.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, the Election Assistance Commission, which oversees more than $800 million in federal election security grants for states, announced it will allow states to use some of those funds to protect poll workers and voters from the virus. States can use the grant funding to pay for disinfecting wipes, masks and other cleaning supplies, the EAC noted in a news release.\n\nThe announcement comes as many poll locations struggle to afford basic sanitation measures, my colleagues Elise Viebeck, Amy Gardner and Isaac Stanley-Becker report. For instance, Illinois election officials promised voters cleaning supplies and disinfectants for Tuesday\u2019s primary that were missing when they arrived.\n\nPWNED: The White House is looking to partner with Facebook, Google and other companies on technology to use phone data location to combat the coronavirus, my colleagues Tony Romm, Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg report.\n\nAD\n\nWhite House officials insist they do not intend to create a database of users\u2019 locations, but the move is still sure to spark a debate over the use of invasive surveillance technologies during the global health pandemic, my colleagues note.\n\nThe government is particularly interested in understanding patterns of people\u2019s movements through anonymized data and statistics. The officials could then use the technology to predict coronavirus hot spots and where to allocate resources, they say.\n\nOther countries have already begun to experiment with location-tracking technology to aid prevention and detection efforts. The Israeli spyware firm NSO Group -- which has come under intense fire for allegedly helping autocratic regimes spy on their citizens -- developed a similar product that it says can map people's users to track the coronavirus, Gwen Ackerman and Yaacov Benmeleh at Bloomberg report. About a dozen countries are testing the technology they report.\n\nPUBLIC KEY\n\n\u2014 The U.S. Election Assistance Commission is hiring Maurice Turner, deputy director of the Internet Architecture Project at the Center for Democracy & Technology, as a senior policy adviser on cybersecurity, Sean Lyngaas at Cyberscoop reports.\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 More cybersecurity news from the public sector:\n\nPRIVATE KEY\n\n\u2014 Cybersecurity news from the private sector:\n\nTHE NEW WILD WEST"}}
