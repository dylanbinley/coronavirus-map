What are they looking for? In the words of Lt. Gen. James Slife, commander of Air Force Special Operations Command, they need something they don\u2019t have to invent.\n\n\u201cWe expect to move quickly through an acquisition program,\u201d said Slife at a Global SOF Foundation event on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. The request for proposals, due out in a matter of days, will draw heavily on the Air Force\u2019s recent experiments with light-attack aircraft.\n\nIn 2018, the Air Force was testing A-29 Super Tucanos from Sierra Nevada and Embraer and AT-6B Wolverines from Textron Aviation. An A-29 crash that June led them to cancel the rest of the test program, but last October, service officials announced that they would buy two or three of each type of aircraft.\n\nSlife was asked how the light-attack plane he wants differed from the A-29 and AT-6B. He answered that there was, perhaps, no difference at all.\n\n\u201cWhatever it turns out being is going to be non-developmental,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for something that can be fielded very, very rapidly.\u201d\n\nRep. Jason Crow, D-Colorado, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, put in a pitch for the A-29, which is being flown by the Afghan military. \u201cTime is money, too\u2026We have obligations now. The A-29 is working. People are trained on it.\u201d Pilots, he said, in particular, are \u201cgiving us great reviews on it.\u201d The aircraft is built in Jacksonville, Florida, and modified in Centennial, Colorado, which is in Crow\u2019s district.\n\nSlife said that he primarily needs something that can do reconnaissance like the U-28A, a single-engine turboprop with a crew of four; and that can provide close air support like the A-10, even if it can\u2019t do either quite as well.\n\nThe U.S. military has put a big emphasis in recent years on competition with Russia or China, whose highly advanced radar systems can quickly detect and down cheap light-attack aircraft. But Crow pointed out that \u201cpeer competition\u201d with China and Russia isn\u2019t just a game of deterrence in Poland, the Black Sea, and the Pacific Ocean. It\u2019s also playing out on the ground in Afghanistan, Syria, and Africa, where all three great powers have allies who sometimes clash in brutish, ugly, low-tech fights. These are battles where fifth-generation aircraft like the F-35 won\u2019t be crucial.\n\n\u201cAn A-29 is far more valuable in situations like Afghanistan than some of those airframes,\u201d said Crow. \u201cInvesting in things that are cheaper, simpler, easier to maintain in the long run is a much better investment in my view.\u201d"}}
