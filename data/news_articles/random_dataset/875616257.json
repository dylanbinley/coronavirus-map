Operation Lifesaver, a nonprofit organization operating in the U.S. and Canada, works to eliminate these preventable incidents.\n\nOperation Lifesaver Inc. (OLI) and Operation Lifesaver Canada are joining forces this week to jointly observe Rail Safety Week in North America. As part of Rail Safety week, the organizations are releasing new videos in their ongoing public awareness campaign aimed at saving lives near railroad tracks.\n\nThe campaign, called #STOPTrackTragedies, features videos with the personal stories of people affected by rail crossing or trespassing incidents \u2014 including victims, friends and family members, locomotive engineers, and first responders. One video will be released each day over the course of Rail Safety Week, and the full campaign can be viewed at stoptracktragedies.ca or oli.org.\n\n\u201cOur goal with #STOPTrackTragedies is to show that making an unsafe decision around tracks and trains \u2013 whether it\u2019s to play on railway equipment, use tracks as a shortcut, or even glance at your cellphone at a crossing \u2013 can have devastating consequences for you, your loved ones and members of your community,\u201d said Sarah Mayes, National Director of Operation Lifesaver Canada.\n\n\u201cLast year\u2019s #STOPTrackTragedies campaign and other RSW efforts generated nearly 3.7 million YouTube views and 18 million impressions on social and traditional media in the U.S. and Canada,\u201d said OLI Executive Director Rachel Maleh. \u201cWe are grateful to our safety partners at the U.S. Department of Transportation, law enforcement agencies and other rail safety groups for their support. Our state Operation Lifesaver programs throughout the nation will carry out activities and events each day during Rail Safety Week to underscore our core mission \u2013 to save lives.\u201d\n\nFederal Railroad Administrator Ronald L. Batory said, \u201cThe Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is pleased to partner with Operation Lifesaver and others in observing Rail Safety Week. Raising awareness about the dangers at crossings and along rail lines is important because preventable injuries or deaths still occur. FRA continually seeks to identify and advance new and innovative solutions to deter and reduce hazards and risky behaviors at grade crossings and on our nation\u2019s railways.\u201d\n\n\u201cSafety is the number one priority for U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA),\u201d said FTA Acting Administrator K. Jane Williams. \u201cEvery day, millions of people ride and work on rail transit systems, and Rail Safety Week is an important opportunity to highlight the need to be safe and alert if walking near commuter trains, light rail or streetcars.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Department of Transportation, under Secretary Elaine L. Chao\u2019s leadership, and the Federal Highway Administration continue to make safety near highway-rail grade crossings a top priority,\u201d said Federal Highway Administrator Nicole R. Nason. \u201cThe FHWA supports the mission of Operation Lifesaver and urges travelers not to take shortcuts when they are near trains and tracks.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., along with a social media ad campaign, activities and messaging will take place each day during Rail Safety Week, including:\n\nSunday, September 22 kicked off the week with a focus on the message No Photos on Tracks to underscore the risks of illegally taking photos, videos or filming on train tracks.\n\nkicked off the week with a focus on the message to underscore the risks of illegally taking photos, videos or filming on train tracks.
