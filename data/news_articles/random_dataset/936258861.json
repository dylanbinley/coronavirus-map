Photo: James Hardisty.\n\nYOU reported Rishi Sunak saying that education and skills hold the key to recovery (The Yorkshire Post, July 8). He went on to say that the nearest thing to a silver bullet in public policy is education and the most important thing to do for people is to furnish them with a brilliant education.\n\nThe reason that the good public/private fee-paying schools provide very good education is they have small, manageable class sizes.\n\nSign up to our daily newsletter The i newsletter cut through the noise Sign up Thanks for signing up!

Photo: James Hardisty.\n\nThis would give everyone the opportunity of a brilliant education and would eradicate the old boy network, replacing it with a network of opportunity for everyone.\n\nIf Mr Sunak (and Mr Johnson) are really serious they will invest a lot of our money in our schools network, as was spent to try and save the economy in this virus pandemic. If only, but I feel the Yorkshire Halo of Mr Sunak slipped a bit when he did not fully support One Yorkshire.\n\nDoes he really mean what he says or is his heart with the Parliament/Whitehall southern Tory bias and not with us all in the rest of the country?\n\nEditor\u2019s note: first and foremost - and rarely have I written down these words with more sincerity - I hope this finds you well.\n\nAlmost certainly you are here because you value the quality and the integrity of the journalism produced by The Yorkshire Post\u2019s journalists - almost all of which live alongside you in Yorkshire, spending the wages they earn with Yorkshire businesses - who last year took this title to the industry watchdog\u2019s Most Trusted Newspaper in Britain accolade.\n\nAnd that is why I must make an urgent request of you: as advertising revenue declines, your support becomes evermore crucial to the maintenance of the journalistic standards expected of The Yorkshire Post.
