Sometimes those policies are nonexistent altogether. Sometimes they involved multiple detailed reporting requirements.\n\nOne example one policy we recently received came from the Roseville Police Department in Minnesota, which received our request after a user suggested that we ask the agency.\n\nIn the Roseville PD policy manual, there is a specific policy related to \u201cDomestic Abuse Involving High Profile Persons or Police Officers.\u201d The guidelines dictate that officer-involved domestic disputes be handled as they would in civilian circumstances. There are added requirements for calling in an additional supervisor to observe the situation:\n\nIf a call doesn\u2019t end in an arrest, there is, nonetheless, supposed to be a separate written explanation of why.\n\nIf the police department isn\u2019t aware of any legal action related to domestic abuse, the officer is expected to inform his or her superiors.\n\nWhen law enforcement officers handle domestic violence involving one of their own, it can intimidate those involved and muddy a deserved impartial treatment of the situation. Having a policy can be a first step in helping to protect victims and communities.\n\nDoes your local police department even have one?
