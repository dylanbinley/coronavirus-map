She was told by doctors that \u201cit is not possible to save her leg.\u201d She lost almost her entire skin on her leg before she was airlifted by a helicopter ambulance to Turkey for treatment.\n\nTurkish plastic surgeon U\u011fur An\u0131l Bing\u00f6l and orthopedics expert Turhan \u00d6zler performed a string of surgeries on Ilieva and saved her leg. She still had trouble walking due to marrow damage on her leg, but G\u00f6khan Meri\u00e7, another Turkish doctor, performed a landmark cartilage transplant, a first in Turkey, on her leg, transplanting cartilage from a donor to the damaged area on her knee.\n\nAfter a long period of treatment, Christina is now able to walk and return to her beloved profession.\n\nShe said she was living her dream of being a model before the accident.\n\n\u201cI started losing hope after the accident, and it was only with the support of the people around me that I survived. People had faith in me and helped me empowered me in my struggle. Anything can happen, but you have to stand strong and should always fight. I understood that I should never give up. Now I have hope to return to my old job, my profession, my career,\u201d she said."}}
