Turkey, whose national broadcaster TRT consistently criticises Egypt, hosts several Brotherhood TV channels.\n\nTurkey and Qatar, political analysts said, undermine Egypt by supporting Islamist militias controlling Tripoli, Libya, and fighting the Cairo-backed National Libyan Army.\n\nErdogan uses every opportunity to criticise Egypt\u2019s government. On September 24, he told the UN General Assembly that Turkey would continue to raise the case of Morsi, who died at an Egyptian court earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThe two countries are purposefully acting against Egyptian political and security interests,\u201d said Nadia Helmy, a professor of political science at Beni Suef University. \u201cThis will force Egypt to react in kind.\u201d\n\nEgyptian media had remained largely silent while Turkish and Qatari media stepped up attacks in recent years. It seems, however, that Egyptians are less likely to continue to maintain the policy of restraint.\n\nIn the intensified sniping, pro-government media in the three countries are acting as proxies for the regimes. Experts said there is strong influence exerted on news organisations, not only by Cairo but also by Doha and Ankara.\n\nThe Egyptian Foreign Ministry issued a strongly worded condemnation of Erdogan a few hours after his General Assembly speech, describing the Turkish president as the least qualified person to talk about democracy and human rights. The Foreign Ministry accused Erdogan of personally sponsoring terrorist organisations.\n\nThis probably was seen as permission for pro-government private media in Egypt to unleash attacks against Turkey and Qatar.\n\nThe media war, analysts said, is grounded in fears that inaccuracies or manipulations in reporting Egyptian developments by Turkish and Qatari media could fuel unrest in Egypt.\n\n\u201cEgypt is fed up and is afraid because media have a great influence now,\u201d Yousry said.\n\nThose recently demonstrating in Egypt were reacting to videos posted by a construction contractor who accused Sisi of misspending public funds and the Egyptian Army of dominating the economy.\n\nIn reporting on the protests, Turkish and Qatari media used blatant fabrications. Some reports used images of old protests to give the impression that Egyptians were revolting en masse against Sisi.\n\nEgypt\u2019s media war will most likely have little effect, experts said.\n\nApart from the fact that the TV stations participating in the campaign are all local, there is a language barrier, especially when it comes to the desire of Egypt\u2019s media to address the public in Turkey.\n\n\u201cThe campaign in Arabic is valueless,\u201d said Sami Abdel Aziz, the former dean of the College of Mass Communication at Cairo University. \u201cHow will Egypt address the Turkish public in a language it does not understand?\u201d\n\nThe media war between Egypt and Turkey and Qatar is a symptom of a deep ideological, geostrategic and economic struggle between the three states, analysts said.\n\nDoha and Istanbul were hoping that the prevalence of Islamist forces over Arab countries would give them leverage in those states, they added.\n\nTurkey is being excluded from the natural gas bonanza in the East Mediterranean region. Egypt\u2019s maritime border demarcation with Greece and Cyprus is leaving Turkey out, which is drawing angry statements from Istanbul.\n\nEgypt has downgraded its diplomatic representation in Turkey, recalled its ambassador from Doha and kicked the Turkish and Qatari ambassadors out.\n\nCompounding this, the analysts said, could be other economic and political measures.\n\n\u201cEgypt should start real escalation against the two countries, including by focusing on the human rights violations committed in them and uncovering them before the world public opinion,\u201d Helmy said.\n\n\u201cEgypt can also host Turkish and Qatari opposition figures and allow them to operate freely here.\u201d"}}
