And for families who rely on free school meals during term time \u2013 those who struggle to keep everyone fed during the holidays \u2013 Brexit threatens to take away even the basic safeguard of good school dinners.\n\nIn council Brexit planning papers leaked to the BBC, authorities across the UK said they could be forced to abandon their nutritional standards for school meals because getting hold of certain foods might be too difficult.\n\nI spent some time last week at an estate where wonderful people are working hard to ensure kids don't go hungry during the holidays. How can anyone reconcile these 'spend what it takes' government Brexit announcements with the routine reality of poverty & hunger today? \u2014 Andrew McRae (@McRaeAndrew) August 11, 2019\n\nSome councils, like North Tyneside, said they might have to turn to more tinned and frozen food amid fears that fresh produce could be in short supply.\n\nHastings Borough Council even braced readers of its Brexit risk papers for the reintroduction of rationing. Bedford Borough Council advised that holding four to six weeks\u2019 supply of non-perishables would be wise.\n\nExperts at North Ayrshire Council pointed to the rising food prices as evidence of the negative impact Brexit would have on school meals, admitting that it \u201cmight need to amend school nutrition standards\u201d. There is a risk suppliers will prioritise supermarkets, they said, creating shortages in public sector catering.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\u2026 Since 1991 The Big Issue has sold more than 200,000,000 copies \u2013 helping the most vulnerable in society earn more than \u00a3115 million.\n\nAndrew Selley is chief executive of Bidfood, one of the country\u2019s biggest food suppliers to schools, hospitals and care homes. He said the company is having to organise its own preparations for a no-deal Brexit, including buying new warehouse space to store\n\nin-demand goods.\n\nThe supplier is looking at building up stores of imports like pasta, tuna, tinned tomatoes, olive oil and rice, Selley said.\n\nIt\u2019s true that many popular imports can\u2019t be replaced with domestic equivalents, he added, saying: \u201cBecause of our changing tastes, unless we\u2019re going to go back to a menu based on the 1700s, we are going to look at imported products and imported tastes and imported flavours.\u201d He also warned that the government will have to invest more cash into free school meals.\n\nBut chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s Brexit taskforce Kevin Bentley said councils are \u201cas prepared as they can be\u201d given the resource, information and advice gaps not being met by central government.\n\nIn England, food standards require that school meals include one or more wholegrain variety of starchy foods each week; at least one portion of both fruit and vegetables per day; at least three different fruits and three different vegetables each week; oily fish at least once every three weeks; and no snacks but nuts, seeds, fruit and vegetables. That could be a thing of the past if Boris Johnson drags the UK off the Brexit cliff-edge."}}
