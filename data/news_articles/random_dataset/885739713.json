Almost four-fifths of staff chose the shorter working week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing this as a businessman, not because I want people to have a nice life,\u201d said Perpetual Guardian founder Andrew Barnes.\n\n\u201cBusiness is slowly coming to the realization that if one in four of your staff is stressed or has a mental health problem, that is not productive.\u201d\n\nInterest in reduced working hours is growing worldwide. Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party has promised a 32-hour week if elected. Microsoft reported a 40 percent rise in productivity when it gave its 2,300 employees in Japan Fridays off in August.\n\nCritics of a shorter working week say it is not suited to all sectors and can be difficult and costly to implement. The Center for Policy Studies think tank, for example, recently released a report estimating Labour\u2019s policy would cost the public sector at least \u00a317 billion (about $21.94 billion or \u00a52.44 trillion).\n\nBarnes, who set up a foundation to fund research into the four-day week and the future of work, said Perpetual Guardian\u2019s output, revenues and profits had grown since it was adopted.\n\nStaff loyalty grew and the company was able to attract better recruits. Stress levels and sick days fell, he said.\n\nProductivity is up 30 to 40 percent, internet surfing down 35 percent, with staff improving time management, shortening meetings and signaling when they do not want to be disturbed.\n\nThe four-day week is mandatory for senior managers to prevent hours from creeping up again. \u201cIf people see a leader who is not taking four days a week, they think: \u2018If I take up this policy, I won\u2019t get to the top,'\u201d Barnes said.\n\nPerpetual Guardian still opens its branches five days a week as staff take different days off. Barnes said it might consider working Saturdays as some employees would prefer to work that day and take a weekday off instead."}}
