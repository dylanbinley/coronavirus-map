Local media reported that Matsui was fired due to drinking problems.\n\nPolice said Matsui, who has admitted to the charge, stabbed Wakisaka, who was from Ibaraki City, Osaka Prefecture, several times in the chest at around 12:45 p.m. on Thursday on the premises of the shipping company. Matsui entered an office and dragged Wakisaka, who was alone at the time, outside before stabbing him with the knife he had brought with him.\n\nHe then fled in a car, but turned himself in at a police station in Mihara City, Hiroshima Prefecture, which is approximately 240 kilometers away from the crime scene, at around 5:10 p.m.\n\n\u00a9 Japan Today"}}
