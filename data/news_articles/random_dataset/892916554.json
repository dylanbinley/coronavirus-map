The Gulf Breeze couple made news in October when they discovered the land they purchased in Gulf Breeze was originally a landfill with layers of garbage buried across its 6.43 acres. The couple have reached out to Santa Rosa County and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection for help.\n\n\u201cThe soil tested positive for contaminants,\u201d said Dimick. \u201cNobody will take responsibility for it, and all of that needs to be dug out. The (rain) runoff goes right into Sound. All of that stuff has been leeching into the environment we all share.\u201d\n\nThe Rodamaker\u2019s are an \u201cextreme case,\u201d said Dimick. But it\u2019s also a wake-up call for local residents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear where a developer\u2019s rights end and ours begin,\u201d she said.\n\nPart of a robust land development code includes a tree ordinance that prevents extreme deforestation. Dimick said municipalities should look to areas that use \u201ccommon sense development.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Seaside, they don\u2019t go and bulldoze all of the trees,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a better way of doing it so we don\u2019t lose quality of life. Once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone. We can\u2019t put it back.\u201d The Florida Forever program was established in 2001 to provide $3 billion for conversation over 10 years. In 2008, it was reauthorized for $300 million annually for 10 years, but after the recession, the funds were used for other things until the well went dry.\n\nIn 2014, 75% of voters passed Florida\u2019s Water and Land Conservation constitutional amendment allowing 33% of revenue from real-estate transactions to fund land purchases through the Florida Forever fund. Gov. Ron DeSantis called for $100 million to the fund in his budget proposal, but environmentalists say that\u2019s not enough.\n\nIn Okaloosa County, the day of action will be at the Oakmonte Shopping Plaza. Organizer and chair of the Okaloosa County Democratic Environmental Caucus of Florida Cay Burton, said she doesn\u2019t know how many people will attend \u2014 it\u2019s just important that they show up.\n\n\u201cA lot of the area doesn\u2019t acknowledge climate change,\u201d Burton said. \u201cWe do believe in science and we care about the outdoors and waterways.\u201d\n\nCaring about the environment shouldn\u2019t be a political action, Burton added, but it can be. That\u2019s why the caucus looks at the environmental scorecard of local and state representatives. And she hopes Saturday\u2019s event will attract more people to the cause.\n\n\u201cPeople need to become aware because things that need to happen are still not happening.\u201d\n\nLocal Forever Florida Days of Action\n\nFort Walton Beach\n\nDate: December 14, 2019\n\nTime: 12 p.m.\n\nLocation: Oakmonte Shopping Plaza, 800 Beal Pkwy NW, Wright, FL (along public sidewalk)\n\nGulf Breeze\n\nDate: December 14, 2019\n\nTime:12:00 pm.\n\nLocation: 1481 Ocean Breeze Lane, Gulf Breeze, FL 32563\n\nPensacola\n\nDate: December 14, 2019\n\nTime: 12:00 p.m.\n\nLocation: Bruce Beach, 601 West Main Street, Pensacola, FL 32502"}}
