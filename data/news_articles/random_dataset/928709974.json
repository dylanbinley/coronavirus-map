At first, it was an overwhelming fatigue, and the 32-year-old Cleveland mother of two tried to push through it.\n\nA fever, headaches and body aches soon followed. Then she noticed she\u2019d lost her senses of taste and smell.\n\nBy March 23, Laquatra could no longer deny the nagging fear she\u2019d had since first falling ill: She might have COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which by then had been detected in every state. That day, 351 new cases, 83 hospitalizations and three deaths were reported in Ohio.\n\nThe phone call Laquatra made next, to a COVID-19 hotline staffed by the area\u2019s public health system, MetroHealth, likely helped contain the spread of her illness to only her husband, Tony.\n\nMetroHealth\u2019s hotline connected the Laquatras to nurses and doctors who assessed their symptoms and checked in daily while they were ill. MetroHealth also took care of all the family\u2019s immediate needs \u2014 including home delivery of prescriptions, groceries, toiletries and diapers for their 2-year-old \u2014 so they could safely stay home until they felt better.\n\nMetroHealth has offered the hotline and home assistance free to any Ohioan since mid-March. It said the hotline, which has fielded more than 11,000 calls, has saved the hospital system from being overwhelmed by a surge of COVID patients. It has also paved the way for a new model of health care delivery, one that brings care where patients are \u2014 at home.\n\nIt\u2019s a model they believe must \u2014 and will \u2014 last beyond the current crisis, saving money for its health care system and addressing the myriad social needs that keep patients from getting and staying healthy.\n\nThe Hotline\n\nIt\u2019s a Tuesday in mid-May and Dr. David Margolius is in his office on MetroHealth\u2019s main campus in Cleveland\u2019s Brooklyn Centre neighborhood, keeping an eye on a screen displaying a list of calls to the hotline.\n\nIt\u2019s late afternoon, and about 63 people have called that day. Ten have been referred for testing. Nearly all of the callers have symptoms of COVID-19 and have been counseled to self-quarantine.\n\nMargolius calls a young woman who works as a protection officer at a juvenile detention center, and shares his half of the conversation with a reporter via video call. A nurse flagged the detention officer\u2019s hotline call for follow-up with a doctor because one of the woman\u2019s colleagues had tested positive for the coronavirus that day. While she doesn\u2019t have any clear symptoms (just a scratchy throat), she\u2019s worried about getting sick and exposing others. After hearing that she\u2019s wearing a mask and maintaining social distance at work, Margolius assures her she\u2019s probably fine.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re on top of it,\u201d he tells her. \u201cIf things change and you develop symptoms, we\u2019re here if you need us.\u201d\n\nDr. Noha Dardir, a family medicine specialist who has fielded about 780 hotline calls, said patients were terrified, but they had few options early on because most of the primary care offices at MetroHealth were closed.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re telling them to call their doctor and not go straight to the emergency room, we had to be there to take those calls. And it had to be 24/7,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt obligated to my patients.\u201d\n\nMetroHealth was prepared for a surge of 1,000 patients, but at the pandemic\u2019s peak in early May, only 13 COVID-positive patients were in intensive care. Only 82 people have been hospitalized with COVID-19 at MetroHealth since the crisis began.\n\nThe hotline\u2019s peak came much earlier, on March 17, when nearly 700 people called. In the hotline\u2019s first three days, staffers advised 200 people to quarantine themselves.\n\n\u201cWe just couldn\u2019t keep up,\u201d said Dr. Nabil Chehade, MetroHealth\u2019s senior vice president for population health. \u201cAt one point, we had to have 12 physicians working to answer these calls.\u201d\n\nCuyahoga County Health Commissioner Terry Allan, who has worked closely with hospitals to trace and contain COVID cases, believes the public hospital\u2019s quick work in advising quarantines for those with symptoms \u2014 even mild ones \u2014 helped to contain the outbreak.\n\n\u201cWe joked early on that if you had a paper cut, we\u2019d tell you to stay home for two weeks,\u201d Allan said. \u201cBut that helps to reduce people from potentially being part of the chain of transmission.\u201d\n\nAs of early June, about 300 of Cuyahoga County\u2019s 1.3 million residents had died of COVID-19. While the county, Ohio\u2019s second most populous, has had a high proportion of the cases in the state, it has fared much better than hard-hit counties with similar demographics in other parts of the country.\n\nNine weeks in, call volume has slowed. Now, about 100 people call daily and about three-quarters talk to a doctor. Still, MetroHealth\u2019s hotline remains available round-the-clock, and Margolius said it\u2019s clearly still needed. The county recently saw its highest rate of infections since the pandemic started, likely due to the partial reopening of Ohio\u2019s economy, which began in mid-May.\n\n\u201cThis is obviously so far from over,\u201d Margolius said.\n\nA New Model\n\nWhen MetroHealth\u2019s doctors told Andrea Laquatra to quarantine at home in late March, she and her husband weren\u2019t sure how they\u2019d manage. They were already low on diapers and wipes, and had been grocery shopping for Tony Laquatra\u2019s parents.\n\n\u201cWe always take care of my mom and dad. We couldn\u2019t do nothing for them because we didn\u2019t want to get them sick,\u201d Tony Laquatra said.\n\nMany others the hospital told to quarantine were in the same boat. So the MetroHealth team added a social worker check-in and same-day delivery of groceries and other basic supplies through the hospital\u2019s Institute for H.O.P.E. (health, opportunity, partnership, empowerment), launched last year with the goal of finding and addressing the causes of health disparities in the community.\n\nAs of May 22, institute staff members had delivered food and supplies to 620 households. In the early days of the pandemic, as the team scrambled to respond to the influx of calls, even members of the hospital\u2019s executive team pitched in on those deliveries. So did some doctors.\n\nThe health system also started screening for loneliness and stress and has since referred 700 people for calls from the hospital\u2019s behavioral health team, Chehade said.\n\nMetroHealth also connected the Laquatras to a church group that could shop for his their parents.\n\n\u201cI just cried, I was so grateful,\u201d Andrea Laquatra said. They have since recovered, and because they were never tested, are among the hundreds of probable COVID cases in the county.\n\nThe pandemic proved to be the perfect opportunity for MetroHealth to deliver on a long-discussed but only partly implemented plan to treat patients at home while addressing the basic social needs that sometimes prevent them from staying healthy, Chehade said.\n\n\u201cWe were forced to really transform our care overnight,\u201d he said.\n\nNo Going Back?\n\nThe health system has vowed not to return to business as usual when the pandemic eases.\n\n\u201cThis is an inflection point in the delivery of health care, and it would be a tragedy if we didn\u2019t learn from it,\u201d said Dr. Brook Watts, MetroHealth\u2019s vice president and chief quality officer. \u201cThe health care system will try to go back because there were a lot of incentives for the system to deliver care the way we did. We\u2019re not going to go back. I\u2019m not going back.\u201d\n\nFor now, MetroHealth is paying for this new model of care through donations, its own funds and payment from Medicare and Medicaid, which have expanded reimbursement for telehealth in response to the pandemic. The health system estimates 30% to 60% of its visits in the future will be managed through telehealth, compared with just 0.5% pre-pandemic.\n\nAnd a new program, Hospital at Home \u2014 which delivers Bluetooth-enabled equipment such as heart rate, blood pressure and blood-oxygen monitors to patients with chronic illnesses to manage their recovery at home \u2014 could deliver hospital-quality care at 60% of the cost for half of all medical-surgical admissions.\n\nIt remains unclear if insurers, including the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services, will continue to pay for expanded health care delivered via telephone or video calls after the pandemic eases. If they return to pre-pandemic rules for reimbursement, it could make maintaining the current model difficult, or even impossible.\n\nFor the model to be viable and adopted widely, MetroHealth CEO Dr. Akram Boutros said, the nation\u2019s health care system will have to reinvest these savings, and redirect the money it wastes on unnecessary tests and procedures, repeated hospitalizations for chronic, manageable diseases and overpriced medications and high-tech devices.\n\n\u201cIt may take some shaming of nonprofit medical institutions to bring them to this same area of focus,\u201d said Boutros. But if they don\u2019t want to do it, he added, they should financially support the health systems that do.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a national health policy news service.
