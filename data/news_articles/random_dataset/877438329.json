The collision occurred as she was riding her bike northbound on SR-67 at 6:12 a.m. when a black Ford Edge traveled onto the shoulder directly in the path of her bike, California Highway Patrol reported. The impact ejected Scott off the bicycle and onto the roadway.\n\nThe Ford driver fled the scene. Three passersby stopped to assist Scott.\n\nAmong them was Ramona resident Gregory Neifeld, who said he was leaving Ramona when he passed a Ford SUV near SR-67 and Etcheverry Street with the bicycle lodged between the passenger side headlight and front wheel.\n\n\u201cAlthough it was still dark about, I clearly saw the SUV momentarily sitting in the middle of the two-lane highway constricting traffic in both directions,\u201d Neifeld said. \u201cUnfortunately, I did not see the driver of the Ford SUV.\u201d\n\nWhen Neifeld saw Scott lying face-down on the dirt shoulder of the northbound side of the highway, he pulled onto the southbound shoulder and ran across the highway where another Samaritan was waving frantically for help from other drivers. Neifeld said he knelt down beside Scott\u2019s head and learned that 911 had already been called.\n\nA third helper arrived to divert traffic and wait for first responders to arrive.\n\n\u201cSitting with the victim, I assessed her injuries to detect any life-threatening or emergency conditions,\u201d Neifeld said. \u201cI placed my hand gently on her right shoulder, told her to remain calm, not to move, and that she was struck by a car and that the ambulance will arrive in a few minutes. Her breathing was aggressive and erratic as she was in shock. She moaned audibly in response. She lost consciousness at this point and this was nearly 20 seconds after I knelt down next to her.\u201d\n\nWhen first responders arrived soon after, Neifeld said he helped two firefighters roll Scott over face-up as one of them placed a brace on her neck and the other gently pulled her onto the stretcher as they rolled her over. Scott was then airlifted to Palomar Medical Center.\n\nNeifeld has visited Scott with her husband, Donald, and the Scotts\u2019 21-year-old son, Donald Junior, at the hospital.\n\nAlso visiting Scott the first two days of the incident was Steven Bray, the CEO of her employer, Power Plus, a nationwide industrial power generator business with three divisions devoted to construction and maintenance of large-scale generator systems.\n\nBray said Scott was on her way to work at Power Plus\u2019s Escondido office on North Quince Street when the collision occurred. Bray said she alternated riding her bike and driving her car on different days to work and was known to go on long-distance bike rides.\n\nScott has worked for Power Plus since 1987. She runs the office as general manager and liaison to customers and vendors such as San Diego Gas & Electric.\n\n\u201cShe does anything needed to get the job done,\u201d said Bray. \u201cI would say she\u2019s in stable condition. The first day was the hardest because they had to figure out what was wrong.\u201d\n\nBray said she suffered severe head trauma. She was breathing on her own and had some level of feeling by Friday, Oct. 4, he said, but physicians were keeping her in a mild induced coma.\n\n\u201cThe rest of her injuries basically are not a real problem, mainly it\u2019s the head injury,\u201d he said, noting she is being monitored around the clock. \u201cThey are trying to keep the swelling down on her brain.\u201d\n\nCHP Officer Jeff Christy said the suspect driver and the vehicle have not been identified. CHP asks that anyone with any information about the event, the location of the vehicle or the suspect contact CHP\u2019s Cajon office at 619-401-2000.\n\nChristy said the lead they had on the suspect license plate 8KPJ239 turned out to be a dead-end. He said the license plate on the suspect vehicle had been stolen from a rental car at San Diego International Airport.\n\n\u201cThe vehicle the plate was assigned to has been ruled out,\u201d Christy said.\n\nHe said the stolen plate is for a Ford Edge that is a different color than the black Ford Edge that struck Scott.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence to indicate that that vehicle was involved based on the investigation,\u201d Christy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragic event.\u201d"}}
