They will now have to remain under quarantine for a further 14 days after arrival in Honiara to adhere to the Orders under the State of Public Emergency declared on 25 March 2020 by H.E the Governor-General, Sir David Vunagi.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe quarantine period will end on 14 April 2020. This is a precautionary measure that must be taken to prevent any possibility of the COVID-19 entering our shores,\u201d says Maritime Department Director Chief Superintendent Sau.\n\n\u201cThe RSIPF wishes to apologize to our good people living in the Kakabona area for causing any anxiety with the patrol boat Auki anchoring outside their villages.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, placing someone under quarantine is to separate people who are well but may be exposed to the virus to see if they become sick. It is a protective or preventive measure that helps reduce the spread of any virus or disease.\n\nThe crew of the patrol boat AUKI will have to be checked at the end of the 14-day quarantine period by Health authorities before they are released.\n\n- Police Media"}}
