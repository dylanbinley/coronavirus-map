He later turned the gun on himself.\n\n\u201cI followed everything I was supposed to do to escape this monster, ... and realized while I held my son for the last time ... that I had to be the voice for so many who have fallen before me in the hands of an abuser,\u201d Tanner-Miller said. \u201cI needed to make sure that my son was not just a number that people tally on a sheet on statistics when there are things that we could be doing in the state of Illinois to protect, to serve and to ensure that Illinois has a future for families.\u201d"}}
