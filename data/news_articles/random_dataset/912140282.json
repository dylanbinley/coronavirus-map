As a result, he said, security agencies will face questions during the inquiry that \u201cwill go to the heart of a lot of their processes, to which secrecy will be justified in some parts.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet with much of the inquiry\u2019s deliberations shielded from public view, New Zealanders lack firm answers about whether state agencies missed warning signs or failed to investigate tips about accused gunman Brenton Tarrant. It is still unknown whether the Australian national, who faces trial in June on murder and terror charges, had help or encouragement in planning his alleged attacks or had links with violent white-supremacist networks.\n\nThe inquiry\u2019s recommendations are due next month, and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s center-left government \u2014 which faces elections in September \u2014 will determine how much to make public. With Tarrant\u2019s hearing approaching, authorities say they need to prevent public disclosure of details that could jeopardize a fair trial or the prospect of a conviction.\n\n\u201cThe general approach is that criminal charges should be tried in court, not in the media, and New Zealand doesn\u2019t have U.S.-style questioning of jurors in high-profile cases, instead limiting what information can be made public. The royal commission will be careful to avoid publicly saying things that would suggest that Brenton Tarrant is guilty,\u201d said Graeme Edgeler, a Wellington-based lawyer and legal commentator.\n\nSuppression orders cover evidence given to the inquiry by New Zealand\u2019s police, intelligence and other state agencies, leading to worries this balancing act provides scope for officials to conceal missteps.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is a distinct possibility that the inquiry report will be, if not a whitewash, a watered-down overview that does not attribute specific blame at the systemic, institutional or individual levels,\u201d said Paul Buchanan, an Auckland-based consultant and commentator on security affairs who has worked with U.S. national security agencies.\n\nIn a letter to the inquiry last year, New Zealand\u2019s former race relations commissioner, Joris de Bres, criticized the secrecy provisions and warned that they risked bringing the probe into disrepute.\n\n\u201cThis level of suppression of evidence and correspondence appears unprecedented,\u201d he wrote. He declined to comment for this article.\n\nAD\n\nA spokeswoman for the commission said investigators had \u201cconducted a private process for good reasons, including needing to protect [Tarrant\u2019s] fair trial rights, national security and allowing people to come forward and provide evidence freely.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe inquiry, led by a senior judge and former diplomat, was \u201cworking on the assumption that after the report has been made public, evidence and information gathered will be made public unless it is subject to issues of privacy, confidentiality, natural justice or national security,\u201d she said.\n\nThe offices of Ardern and Justice Minister Andrew Little did not respond to requests for comment. Little has said that in the months before the massacre, officials had been discussing closer monitoring of far-right extremism.\n\nAD\n\nThere is frustration in the Muslim community over alleged failures by the authorities in the lead-up to the mosque slaughter. A submission to the inquiry by the Islamic Women\u2019s Council of New Zealand contends that if officials had acted more rigorously in response to Muslims\u2019 calls for protection from elements threatening their community, the gunman would likely \u201cnever have got to the door of the mosques.\u201d\n\nAliya Danzeisen, a council member who sits on the Muslim reference group to the inquiry, has said that just a day before the attacks in Christchurch, she signed a police statement concerning a threat against her community.\n\nBut the secrecy has meant that the inquiry process may not be as open to challenge as it should be, she said. \u201cThe suppressions and the limited terms of reference mean that we can\u2019t access any testimony and challenge it, or say whether or not it fits with our experience. There is definitely a power imbalance here, but that\u2019s not the fault of the commission \u2014 it\u2019s on the government.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA spokesman for New Zealand\u2019s intelligence agencies said the commission\u2019s scrutiny was vital for the victims\u2019 families and for maintaining public confidence in intelligence work. \u201cWe must learn from this tragedy, and we will,\u201d he said, adding that intelligence officials were cooperating with the process despite being restricted in what they could say publicly.\n\nPolice, too, said they had been working closely with the commission.\n\nWithout a U.S.-style constitutional guarantee of free speech, constraints on reporting in New Zealand can be wider than would be allowed under U.S. law, said Andrew Geddis, a professor of law at the University of Otago.\n\nDespite the secrecy, Abdul Aziz, a survivor of the attacks, said he had faith in the process.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the government are doing their best; not everything can be made public yet,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce the [Tarrant] case is finished, I expect the government will lift restrictions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSecurity remains a live issue for New Zealand\u2019s Muslim community. This month, a man was arrested in connection with an alleged threat against one of the mosques attacked in Christchurch."}}
