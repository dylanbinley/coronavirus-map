Gary Herbert declared a state of emergency in preparation for what was seen as the illness\u2019 inevitable arrival in the state.\n\nAlthough this is the first case to be confirmed in Utah, \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize that this does not represent the first case of community spread in the state of Utah,\u201d said Angela Dunn, state epidemiologist, in a Friday news conference.\n\nThe patient, a person older than 60, went to see a doctor in Utah after developing symptoms and has agreed to follow an isolation order, said Brian Hatch, executive director of the Davis County Health Department.\n\nStill, the health officials said, the case represents a turning point.\n\nUtah can expect more cases, and those who develop symptoms will end up staying holed up in their homes as the state seeks to limit exposure to older Utahns and those with other health conditions.\n\nDunn and her colleagues believe the traveler was exposed to the illness while on a recent cruise aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship that returned to port. While the Utahn is the first person on that particular cruise to develop symptoms, other Utahns were aboard the ship. Health officials are trying to get in touch with them.\n\nThe Grand Princess and its current passengers and crew are waiting aboard the ship off the California coast after 21 people there tested positive for the virus.\n\nBecause the Utah traveler\u2019s test was done by a state lab, it is considered a presumptive positive, Dunn said, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will conduct further testing. The patient is now at home in isolation as health officials reach out to those who may have been in contact with the traveler.\n\nHerbert said the state did not know about the case when he made an emergency declaration earlier Friday. Officials found out about 5:30 p.m., according to Dunn.\n\nRelated:\n\nThe emergency declaration was made out of \u201ca state of readiness\u201d at the time, in the event of increased demand on the health care system if cases do emerge, according to state officials.\n\n\u201cOur No. 1 focus is preparing for the arrival of novel coronavirus,\u201d Herbert said in a statement. \u201cIssuing this declaration now allows us to take additional proactive steps that will make a big difference in how effectively we can respond once we start seeing COVID-19 diagnoses in Utah.\u201d\n\nHe said the declaration was made at the request of the Utah COVID-19 Task Force, which met for the first time Friday.\n\n\u201cWhile no one in Utah has yet tested positive for COVID-19, issuing this order now allows our state and communities to access additional funding and resources that will be instrumental in helping us prepare to slow the spread of coronavirus,\u201d said Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, who leads the task force.\n\nSimilarly, the governor issues emergency declarations ahead of wildfire season to receive federal resources for when fires break out.\n\nSalt Lake County issued its own emergency declaration Friday evening, which County Mayor Jenny Wilson emphasized \u201cdoes not mean we are currently experiencing an emergency.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means that we are now in a formal state of preparedness that allows us to utilize resources we expect will be necessary when we encounter the first case of coronavirus transmitted locally,\u201d Wilson said in a prepared statement, noting county departments and divisions are organized and ready should COVID-19 begin spreading in the area.\n\nMeanwhile on Friday, the first person to be treated in Utah for the novel coronavirus returned to his St. George home.\n\nMark Jorgensen became sick while on a Princess cruise ship in Japan and was flown to Intermountain Medical Center in Murray where he remained in isolation since Feb. 28. As of Friday, Jorgensen has no symptoms and will stay isolated at home until he has two consecutive negative tests for COVID-19, state health officials said.\n\nJorgensen posted a Facebook Live video from his living room, at first wearing a face mask while his wife was in the room. Though they are now in their own home, the couple remains under \u201cspecial rules.\u201d\n\nIn this image from video, provided by the California National Guard, a helicopter carrying airmen with the 129th Rescue Wing flies over the Grand Princess cruise ship off the coast of California Thursday, March 5, 2020. (California National Guard via AP)\n\n\u201cI am confined to the house, I don\u2019t go anywhere, I am to use a separate bedroom and bathroom,\u201d Jorgensen said, explaining that though he\u2019s back together with his wife, Jerri, it\u2019s tough because they must keep distance from each other.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be compliant and do what they ask us to do,\u201d he explained.\n\nJerri Jorgensen is believed to be immune to the virus as she already had it and has since tested negative, Mark Jorgensen said.\n\n\u201cI continue to be asymptomatic. I feel great. It feels great to be home. And kind of breathing a sigh of relief,\u201d he said, though the couple did worry about threats they said they received from people upset about them returning to St. George.\n\nDr. Angela Dunn, state epidemiologist, emphasized that there is no risk to the public in Jorgensen returning home. He will be swabbed for the virus every other day, she said, and monitored by the Southwest Public Health Department. It is unclear how long it will be until he might test negative for the virus, she said.\n\n\u201cHe has been asymptomatic, meaning he hasn\u2019t shown any symptoms from the time he even tested positive, and so there is no risk from him transmitting to others, especially since he is on home isolation,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nAllowing Jorgensen to go home frees up resources in the health care system, especially as beds are needed during the ongoing flu season, according to Dunn, as well as to alleviate the toll on him after several weeks in hospital isolation.\n\n\u201cI mean, he\u2019s been isolated for a month or longer,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile anxieties over a potential outbreak continue to brew in Utah and nationwide, stores have seen their shelves wiped of toilet paper, water bottles, hand sanitizer and over-the-counter cold medications.\n\nCases of the virus Friday surpassed 100,000 in 90 countries and spurred the cancellation of religious and large cultural events, including South by Southwest arts festival in Austin, Texas, according to the Associated Press.\n\nMultiple outlets reported Costco has suspended offering food samples. A statement from the wholesale chain on Thursday said the company saw a 10.5% increase in net sales for the quarter compared to last year.\n\n\u201cFebruary sales benefited from an uptick in consumer demand in the fourth week of the reporting period. We attribute this to concerns over the coronavirus,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nAlso on Friday, according to one Utah police department, novel coronavirus preppers pilfered the station\u2019s toilet paper.\n\nKaysville police officer Joshua Danielson said the culprit remains a mystery.\n\n\u201cWe received a complaint in our lobby that consistently the men\u2019s restroom was devoid of toilet paper. And we have someone who\u2019s employed to actually stock that, and it shouldn\u2019t be running out so quickly, we would assume,\u201d Danielson said.\n\nPotential \u201cinvolved parties\u201d haven\u2019t been contacted for an interview yet, he said.\n\n\u201cFor those of you preparing for the coronavirus, what is the need for the hoarding of toilet paper? The Kaysville Community must be in a state of crisis that someone has resorted to obtaining all the toilet paper from the (Kaysville Police Department\u2019s) public restrooms. We love our community and we are here to serve you, but cops need toilet paper too! Let\u2019s go back to the days of obsessing over power poles!\u201d the department posted on Facebook.\n\nLuckily, a concerned citizen donated a new package to the officers, saying, \u201cYou need this more than I do,\u201d according to a tweet from the department.\n\nThe theft \u2014 as well as the empty store shelves across the state \u2014 prompts questions of how much panic is actually warranted.\n\nThough cases have been confirmed in neighboring states, there\u2019s still no reason to panic, Cox said.\n\n\u201cOur focus right now is really on preparation. The good news is, we do not have any confirmed cases here in the state of Utah, although our neighboring states now do \u2014 Colorado, Nevada now have confirmed cases. So again, we know it\u2019s coming this way, but our biggest focus right now is getting ahead of this as much as possible,\u201d Cox told the Deseret News after the first meeting of the task force charged with getting ready should an outbreak occur in Utah.\n\nThe group \u2014 made up of representatives from local government, education, health, business and community organizations \u2014 will meet twice a week and hold conference calls as needed, Cox said.\n\nAccording to the lieutenant governor, Friday\u2019s task force meeting focused on making sure health care providers don\u2019t become overwhelmed if the virus starts to spread; working with public education officials on protocols if there is a confirmed case in a school; and figuring out how and where to care for the most vulnerable populations like the elderly.\n\nWhat about the toilet paper and bottled water shortage?\n\n\u201cWhat we know is that most cases of this disease are very mild, so it would be like the cold or a moderate version of the flu. You would just be at home,\u201d Cox said, urging people to think about what they would need if homebound for two weeks.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s good to have bottled water on hand for emergencies, it\u2019s not necessary for the coronavirus, he said.\n\n\u201cOur tap water will continue to work just fine. So just really, whatever it is that you need to prepare, you like Diet Coke a lot, make sure you buy an extra six pack next time you\u2019re at the store,\u201d Cox said.\n\nThe Utah Department of Environmental Quality also confirmed that tap water would remain safe, as \u201cpublic drinking water systems are designed to continuously deliver safe drinking water to your tap.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other thing we want people to understand is that we have the best and brightest in the state working on this. And if there comes a time when we need to do something to take different measures, we\u2019ll let you know. And we\u2019re on top of that. And it won\u2019t be the politicians making those decisions, it\u2019ll actually be the scientists and the people at the Department of Health who know what they\u2019re doing in these types of outbreaks,\u201d Cox said.\n\nCox had come under fire on Twitter Thursday for deleting a tweet on the Utah Coronavirus Task Force account. The tweet had included a video of President Donald Trump on Fox News telling people they can go to work with the coronavirus. In the tweet, a member of the task force had urged people not to go to work if they have symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nCox tweeted that the original tweet with the video of the president was deleted because it \u201cappeared political\u201d in nature and the \u201cWhite House has been a tremendous partner in our COVID-19 response.\u201d\n\nHe said on Friday Utah \u201chas been recognized as the most prepared state in the nation\u201d and hasn\u2019t seen a lot of panic, other than clearing store shelves of toilet paper and water bottles.\n\n\u201cWhich again, people just want to be prepared for whatever\u2019s coming, and that\u2019s a positive thing. So we just recommend that people keep doing what they\u2019re doing, but just be safe if you are sick,\u201d Cox said.\n\nAddressing potential threats the Jorgensens received, Cox urged Utahns that if there are confirmed cases in their neighborhood, not to panic.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea of quarantining and staying in your house, which is happening ... the disease will not spread when you do that. ... We\u2019re not going to be able to keep people out of our communities that have this disease, but we can keep it from spreading. And that\u2019s the critical message.\u201d\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) resources Prevention\n\nTo help mitigate infectious transmission of COVID-19, health care officials advise anyone who thinks they might have the virus to first call their doctor before going to a hospital\n\nWash hands thoroughly and often\n\nStay home if you\u2019re feeling sick\n\nDon\u2019t touch your face\n\nCough or sneeze in your elbow or a tissue Risk and symptoms\n\nYou could be at risk of having COVID-19 if you\u2019ve recently traveled to mainland China, South Korea or, to a lesser extent, Japan, Italy and Iran\n\nInfected patients typically have a fever, cough and shortness of breath\n\nCorrection: An earlier version said the Utah patient diagnosed Friday is a man.
