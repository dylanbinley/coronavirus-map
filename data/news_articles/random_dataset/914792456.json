The economic rescue package is the largest ever adopted in the nation\u2019s history and was finally passed after days of tense negotiations between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nIt includes billions in relief for businesses, hospitals and everyday Americans \u2014 including one-time direct payments of up to $1,200 for many adults.\n\nThe House is expected to approve the measure tomorrow, and the president has already said he will sign it immediately.\n\nWe spoke with Sen. Martha McSally earlier this week on The Show about the negotiations around the bill. So, now to let\u2019s hear from Seb. Kyrsten Sinema. The Show spoke with her shortly before the Senate rallied around the bill yesterday.\n\nMore Stories From KJZZ"}}
