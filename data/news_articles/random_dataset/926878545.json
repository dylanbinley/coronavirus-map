It hasn\u2019t gone back to pre-Eid circumstances or conditions. And at the same time the government of Afghanistan in response to the ceasefire and the reduction of violence that has taken place has accelerated the release of prisoners,\u201d he mentioned.\n\nHe also said that About 2,500 Taliban prisoners have been released since the US and Taliban signed the agreement in February.\n\nOn the political crisis in Afghanistan, Khalilzad said: \u201cThe political crisis in Afghanistan that produced two presidential inaugurations, now it\u2019s been resolved, and the two leaders are working together on an agenda for peace.\u201d\n\nIn response to questions about the UN report released on Monday stating that the Taliban has maintained relations with al-Qaida, Khalilzad said: \u201cFirst, the report I have not read, but from what I\u2019ve heard it covers the period until March 15th, and you remember that the agreement we signed on the 29th of February.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo, we are monitoring Taliban compliance with that agreement, which, as you know, stipulates that there will be no hosting of al-Qaida or any other terrorist group that could threaten the security of the United States and our allies. We have had good discussions with them, and we have a monitoring group that monitors in detail what\u2019s happening with regard to their commitments, the Talib commitments on terrorism, not only vis-a-vis groups such as al-Qaida but also on Daesh. And we believe that there is progress, but we will continue to monitor those activities very closely,\u201d he said.\n\nA UN report released on Friday states that the Taliban has failed to fulfill one of the core parts of the US-Taliban agreement, namely that it would break ties with al-Qaeda.\n\nAl-Qaeda has 400 to 600 operatives active in 12 Afghan provinces and is running training camps in the east of the country, according to the report.\n\nKhalilzad said that the US and Taliban are committed to the signed agreement, adding: \u201cThat commitment is not only from the Taliban, the result of the US-Taliban agreement but also by the Afghan Government as a result of the joint declaration between the two sides\" that was declared on the same day.\n\nAsked about the accelerated US troop drawdown, Khalilzad said: \u201cOn the reduction of forces, of course based on the agreement and subject to the conditionality that I mentioned, we are proceeding with the drawdown.\" He reiterated that the agreement was \"conditions based\" and said whether the troop withdrawal happens sooner or later is based on the \"prerogative of the President if he thinks that the conditions have been met and we could do it faster. But the key thing is that whether conditions have been met...we are monitoring that very closely.\"\n\nKhalilzad also said he hopes that violence will stay at very low levels before the intra-Afghan negotiations begin, as those negotiations will determine the comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Afghanistan.\n\nOn the Taliban commitments, Khalilzad said that the US is monitoring closely what happens with regard to \u201cterrorism, in terms of delivery on the commitments that the Taliban have made. \"We do notice that they are fighting Daesh and that\u2019s one of the commitments that have been made,\u201d said Khalilzad.\n\n\u201cWell, the Taliban fight Daesh, as you know, and they\u2019ve been substantial adversaries vis-a-vis each other. Daesh is working against peace, is working against reduced level of violence, and they have been responsible, some of \u2013 for some of the most dastardly attacks recently, including the attack on the hospital,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cWe believe that the Talibs have been important, besides the Afghan security forces and ourselves, in the fight against Daesh that has taken place. And Daesh is a fact of life in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nOn the status of the $1 billion of US assistance that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said was frozen Khalizlad said: \u201cOn the money, you should consult with the Pentagon. I think the Secretary has spoken on that issue. On the details of the implementation, I refer you to the Pentagon.\u201d\n\nAbout two weeks ago, Reuters reported that the US Defense Department has not withheld $1 billion in funding from Afghan security forces despite Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s vow on March 23 to cut that sum \u201cimmediately,\" five sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe Pentagon has been reluctant to shave the funds announced by Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper has not provided guidance to his agency on how to carry it out, three sources told Reuters.\n\nIt was unclear why the cut has not been made, whether President Donald Trump\u2019s administration may have decided not to reduce the funding - no such policy change has been announced - or if there was some disconnect between the State and Defense Departments."}}
