In the United Kingdom, at least 152 Jewish funerals for people who died of the coronavirus have been held, according to the Board of Deputies of British Jews.\n\ncnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });\n\nIn France, at least one cemetery with a Jewish section, Thiais, is nearing capacity after receiving several dozen bodies in the past two weeks.\n\nExperts estimate that Jewish communities have been susceptible to the virus because their members travel often, have an extended circle of friends and family, and are concentrated in large cities."}}
