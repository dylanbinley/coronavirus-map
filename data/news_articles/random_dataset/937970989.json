A study released on Tuesday that tested for coronavirus antibodies reported some 57 per cent of people in Mumbai\u2019s teeming slums have had the infection\u2014far more than official data suggests.\n\nThe Tata Institute of Fundamental Research\u2019s Ullas S. Kolthur, who was involved in carrying out the survey, said he was surprised by the results. \u201cAt least in the slums, we think it is largely because social distancing wouldn\u2019t work simply because of the population density,\u201d Kolthur told AFP.\n\nLast week a similar study indicated that almost a quarter of people in the capital, New Delhi, have had the virus\u2014almost 40 times the official total.\n\nThere are, however, also doubts about the accuracy of such tests, since other coronaviruses\u2014not just the novel Covid-19 \u2014 may also produce antibodies that could give a false positive result.\n\nThe Mumbai survey also covered a relatively small sample of around 7,000 people.\n\nIndia now has the third-highest number of cases in the world behind the United States and Brazil, although the official number of deaths in the South Asian nation is far lower."}}
