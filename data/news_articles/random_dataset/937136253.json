In recent days amid a resurgence of cases in areas across the country, many states and major hospital chains have said they are in better shape \u2014 but some medical professionals and lawmakers have cast doubt on those improvements as shortages have begun to reappear.\n\nRELATED: White House urges health care workers to reuse PPE amid growing shortages as COVID-19 pandemic worsens\n\n\u201cWe are in a much better place than we were coming out of March and April. However, we are not out of the woods completely with PPE,\u201d Gaynor testified on Wednesday. \u201cAgain, the majority of PPE is made offshore. China, Malaysia, Vietnam. And so one of our efforts early on with the Supply Chain Stabilization Task Force was to accelerate that PPE to the United States.\u201d\n\nFEMA Administrator Peter T. Gaynor holds up a copy of the COVID-19 Pandemic Operational Guidance for the 2020 Hurricane Season during a hearing before the House Committee on Homeland Security on Capitol Hill July 22, 2020 in Washington, D.C. (Photo b Expand\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGaynor said the agency has taken \u201cmeasures to preserve PPE\u201d here and to increase production within the U.S.\n\n\u201cAll of those things are happening, continue to happen. We are producing N95 masks in the U.S. We need to produce other items, and through our partnership with the federal government, the (Department of Defense), the (Defense Logistics Agency) and many other partners, we are working towards that but it is not a light switch,\u201d Gaynor said. \u201cWe have some distance to travel.\u201d\n\nRELATED: CoronavirusNOW.com, FOX launches national hub for COVID-19 news and updates\n\nAmid the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1 and typically runs through November, Gaynor was questioned on whether FEMA is ready to handle both the ongoing pandemic and potential disaster.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think FEMA has been more ready than we are today,\u201d Gaynor said. \u201cWe have not only dealt with COVID-19 response, ongoing response. We have dealt with flooding in Michigan, earthquakes in Puerto Rico. We have dealt with tornadoes, and we are completely ready for hurricane season.\u201d\n\nThe committee said it invited officials from the Department of Health and Human Services to join the hearing, but the Trump administration refused to allow any official to testify, according to a statement.\n\n\u201cThe American people should be furious that the Administration believes that they do not need to be transparent on this issue that affects all of us. Because of their refusal, we will only get a partial picture of the Federal government\u2019s response efforts,\u201d Committee on Homeland Security Chair Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, D-Miss., said in the statement.\n\nRELATED: World coronavirus cases near 15M; Trump says things will get worse\n\nThe hearing was held as the global tally of confirmed COVID-19 cases neared 15 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. remains the worst-hit country in the pandemic with nearly 4 million confirmed cases, as of July 22.\n\nAccording to data released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of reported cases in the U.S. vastly underestimates the true number of infections \u2014 thought to be likely 10 times higher in many regions.\n\nThis story was reported from Cincinnati."}}
