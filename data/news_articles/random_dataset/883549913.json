The Sydney-based bank is looking to focus its equities business on selling Asia-Pacific research and trading services globally. It will maintain a sales presence in London and New York, and sign an agreement with Paris-based Kepler Cheuvreux to distribute each others\u2019 research.\n\nLenders including Citigroup Inc. and Germany\u2019s Joh. Berenberg Gossler & Co. are cutting back equity teams as the industry struggles with reduced demand for research following the introduction of Europe\u2019s MiFID II market rules, and a decade-long decline in equity trade commissions.\n\nTie-ups with other research houses are becoming more common as the tougher market forces banks to shift business models. BNP Paribas SA in July signed a deal with Morningstar Inc. to use its content across Asia.\n\nThe cuts won\u2019t impact Macquarie\u2019s economic research or commodities operations in the U.S. or U.K., the people said. The bank will continue to do some thematic equities research, but will no longer cover individual stocks. A spokesman for Macquarie declined to comment.\n\nStaff were told of the cuts at a town hall meeting in London Tuesday morning, with meetings in New York scheduled for later in the day.\n\nThe cash-equities business in South Africa will be closed as part of the plan, affecting as many as 35 positions, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Australian investment bank, which has grown into the world\u2019s largest manager of infrastructure assets, will report half-year results Friday. It is currently forecasting full-year earnings will \u201cdrop slightly\u201d from last year\u2019s record -- though tends to start conservatively before upgrading its profit targets throughout the year.\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Joshua Fineman, Loni Prinsloo, and Roxanne Henderson\n\n( Updates with quote in second paragraph, South Africa cuts in seventh. )"}}
