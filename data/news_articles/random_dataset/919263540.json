We hope we\u2019ll have more to say about those next steps this week.\u201d\n\nOpinion polls show the public overwhelmingly supports social distancing measures, and a Newsweek story released this week said COVID-19 cases in Kentucky increased after a week of protests to \u201creopen\u201d the state.\n\nThurman said the county\u2019s resolution is an expansion of letters sent by the commissioners last week asking the governor to allow construction and fishing and hunting to resume.\n\nThe resolution also asks Inslee to discuss the emergency orders with legislative leaders as outlined in state law and to cease entering into multi-state agreements that effect the citizens of Cowlitz County while disregarding the mandates of that state law.\n\nThurman said the resolution is directed at Inslee\u2019s contract with Oregon and California but hasn\u2019t consulted state legislature on extending the order beyond its initial 30 days."}}
