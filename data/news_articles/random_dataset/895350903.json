Currently, the Thai fishing industry faces a labor shortage of 53,000.\n\n\u201cThe hypothesis of this report is that a healthy industry would respond to these pressures first by making pay and working conditions more favorable, thereby retaining workers and attracting new ones. Second, the industry would also make capital investments to reduce its demands on the labor market,\u201d it said.\n\nInstalling hydraulic \u2018power block\u2019 systems and an upgrade in on-board catch refrigeration systems, for instance, could do this; IOL estimates both would reduce onboard labor needs by 37%, while simultaneously raising the value of catch.\n\nSuch an upgrade would cost THB 1.75 million ($58,000), which could be paid for with soft loans.\n\n\u201cA soft loan program for purse seiner reconfigurations of THB 1.5m-2m could allow fishing operators, with support from public and private lending institutions, to make these improvements and comfortably repay loans in approximately two years.\u201d A loan guarantee program that supports $5m in lending, meanwhile, could help reconfigure 80-100 vessels in a two-year cycle, it said.\n\n\u201cThe Thai commercial fishing workforce is currently overwhelmingly dependent on migrant workers; in 2018, approximately 90% of the industry\u2019s approximately 60,000 fishers were from Myanmar and Cambodia. [But] the apparent lack of interest among large numbers of migrant workers for work in Thai fishing is telling.\u201d"}}
