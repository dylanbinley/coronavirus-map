Appearing in a segment with host Rachel Maddow, O\u2019Donnell said that the report could have massive implications if proven true, Salon noted.\n\n\u201cThat would explain \u2014 it seems to me \u2014 every kind word Donald Trump has ever said about Russia and [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, if true, and I stress the if true part of this,\u201d O\u2019Donnell replied, saying that this report would \u201ctest the Trump theory that he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue and his supporters would still be with him.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Donnell stressed that the information came from a single source and was not confirmed by NBC News. In addition, he had not personally seen the documentation from Deutsche Bank that would support the claim. Many touted the revelation as a bombshell that if true could sink Donald Trump\u2019s hopes of re-election in 2020, and reporter David Cay Johnston appeared to confirm that he has information matching what O\u2019Donnell reported. But some pushed back against what appeared to be lightly sourced reporting, noting that the claim did not appear to be corroborated beyond O\u2019Donnell\u2019s single source.\n\nSingle source report tonight by @Lawrence, when I was his opening guest, of Russian co-signers on Trump\u2019s Deutsche Bank loans fits w/ what I\u2019ve been saying for years.\n\n\n\nJudge should review loan docs in chambers. If true, judge can - and should - put in public record ASAP.\n\n\n\n. \u2014 David Cay Johnston (@DavidCayJ) August 28, 2019\n\nTrump responded on Wednesday by issuing a letter through personal attorney Charles Harder threatening to sue NBCUniversal for defamation and demanding that the report be retracted. The letter also referenced a tweet in which O\u2019Donnell repeated the claim.\n\n\u201cThe Program and Tweet make the false and defamatory statements that \u2018Russian oligarchs\u2019 co-signed loans provided to Mr. Trump by Deutsche Bank, and described these \u2018co-signers\u2019 as \u2018Russian billionaires close to Vladimir Putin,'\u201d the letter said.\n\nHarder also issued warnings against other publications that reported on O\u2019Donnell\u2019s claim, though some are refusing to back down. The Hollywood Reporter said that it would be reporting on the allegations \u201cbecause it believes such republication is a matter of utmost public concern and protected by the First Amendment in connection with anticipated litigation.\u201d\n\nThreatening to sue someone for misrepresenting your financial dealings while trying to keep all of your business and tax records from being made public makes your legal threats....a little weaker. https://t.co/ipVCWOK5ie \u2014 Tim O'Brien (@TimOBrien) August 28, 2019\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter noted that Donald Trump is famous for issuing threats to sue for defamation against publications that are critical of him, but following through on this threat would open him to up a discovery phase where NBCUniversal would have access to the underlying tax documents."}}
