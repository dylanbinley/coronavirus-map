I\u2019m very much over the past 12 months, the first full year after the Camp Fire.\n\nWhat rankles me is how, despite the county having been declared a federal disaster zone and all of the ripple effects throughout the region, the partisan divisions widened in a time where unity should\u2019ve reigned.\n\nSo, in the spirit of saying good riddance to a hellish year, I\u2019m revisiting a few happenings in Chico\u2019s political landscape that I\u2019m happy we\u2019re moving past.\n\nGoodbye to the recall effort This scheme was doomed because its conservative organizers weren\u2019t organized enough. Proponents will deny that their failure to boot Chico Mayor Randall Stone and Councilman Karl Ory was partisan. They\u2019ll also say they ended it by choice, attributing that move to the switch to district elections.\n\nI\u2019m not buying it. Recalls are part of a new national right-wing strategy to unseat progressives in key positions. Moreover, the group launched the effort only five months after the progressives took the majority, and dropped the cause before the council voted on districting.\n\nGoodbye to at-large elections This one is a long time coming and a biggie. The switch to district elections should\u2019ve taken place years ago, when local group Districts for Chico first pitched the idea and warned city leaders the current system runs the risk of violating the California Voting Rights Act. It was largely the progressives who dropped the ball at the time.\n\nLots of benefits here. Among them, people who aren\u2019t deeply embedded in partisan politics\u2014on both sides of the ideological divide\u2014will have fewer competitors and fewer constituents to reach during a campaign. That will make running more affordable. In previous years, some candidates have raised upward of $50,000.\n\nGoodbye affronts to our homeless community Chico has long taken the path of least resistance on addressing homelessness. There were strides this year to alter the course, including funding allocated for warming and cooling centers a few months into 2019. But one of the biggest changes in terms of the city\u2019s path forward will be to revisit and likely repeal laws in the municipal code that criminalize life on the streets.\n\nPeople who advocated for them will argue with that characterization, but it\u2019s precisely the conclusion the U.S. Supreme Court came to last week when it let stand a federal appeals court ruling that it\u2019s unconstitutional to cite people for camping in public when they have nowhere to go. Technically, the local changes won\u2019t happen until 2020, but the high court has laid the groundwork. Perhaps this is just the incentive people\u2014including the NIMBYs\u2014need to work collectively to drive forward affordable housing and shelter facilities."}}
