There is lots of it but let's start here: this weekend sees the opening of Still Game at the SSE Hydro, a comedy experience which has attracted almost half of all Scottish television audiences at one point and is set to fill another 15 nights at the country\u2019s biggest arena.\n\nThe argument against Connolly\u2019s theory is simple: Still Game wouldn\u2019t have become so successful had it not tapped into the essence of Scotland.\n\nWhat is that essence? And how can you identify the integral parts of what could be claimed to be Scottish comedy? It\u2019s much more than a taps aff, caramel wafer and a p*** poor customer service relationship with the world. What you have to do in the first instance is to look at the categories of gags which appeal in particular to the Scottish taste. Some of the styles may not be exclusive to Caledonia; there may often, for example, be a strong connection with New York Jewish humour. But when we see strong patterns, themes emerge. It\u2019s not hard to see why the Still Game boys and girls have become a resounding success story.\n\nAGGRESSION\n\nThe Germans don\u2019t like it up 'em, as Corporal Dunn declared in Dad\u2019s Army, and nor do Scots, but we can take it when required, and most certainly give it back. Take Connolly\u2019s own line, for example: \"A lot of people say it's a lack of vocabulary that makes you swear. Rubbish. I know thousands of words but I still prefer f***.\"\n\nKiernan and Hemphill write as aggressively as a pensioner pulling open a packet of Viagra. For example, every time Jack and Victor walk into the Clansman, Boaby has an insult. \u201cHo, ho. It\u2019s the Two Ronnies.\u201d Which elicits the response from Victor: \u201cThe Two Ronnies, is it, aye? Well then it\u2019s shut-up-ya-p**** from me.\u201d And Jack adds: \u201cAnd it\u2019s shut-up-ya-p**** from him!\u201d\n\nIndeed, right from the very first stage show days at the Edinburgh Festival, aggression was running lion rampant. Jack comes up the stairs, having dealt with a crowd of fitba\u2019 playing teenagers who\u2019d bounced the ball off his head. He describes in colourful detail the language he used to berate them. Then adds, in all innocence, \u201cAnd you should have heard whit they bast***ing called me.\u201d The laughs were louder than his indignation.\n\nPHILOSOPHY\n\nScotland is the home of philosophy, a nation which has produced David Hume, Adam Ferguson, and Frankie Boyle. Boyle once came to the conclusion: \u201cGlasgow is a very negative place. If Kanye [West] was born in Glasgow, he would have been called No You Cannae.\u201d\n\nJaney Godley mused: \u201cI can\u2019t cook, I can\u2019t clean, and the last time I tried to do soup it ended up in sex, because sex is quicker than soup.\u201d And Connolly\u2019s observation is up there with anything Kant ever created. \u201cSex is not the answer. Sex is the question. Yes is the answer.\u201d\n\nStill Game\u2019s Isa is also a philosopher of some distinction, who once reflected: \"This happened to big Janice McCafferty, her wae the eating disorder. Ah, you know who ah\u2019m talking about ... she got barred fae Greggs for grazing.\u201d\n\nOr Victor\u2019s rush against the sands of time proclamation: \u201cHe who hingeth aboot get hee-haw.\u201d Or Jack\u2019s carpe diem: \u201cWhen life hands you melons, make melonade.\u201d\n\nSARCASM\n\nThis is so often mistaken for irony by our American cousins but the reality is we\u2019re a nation of cheeky b\u2019s. Connolly once said: \u201cPeople come up to me and say, \u2018I went to Scotland once and it was raining.\u2019 Oh course it was raining. Where you do think you were? The Pyrenees?\u2019\u201d\n\nStill Game\u2019s Victor serves up sarcasm the way Isa serves up meaningless drivel. In The Clansman: \u201cOooh, did ye hear that, Jack. They have pies.\u201d Jack replies; \u201cOh, that\u2019s dandy because I was getting sick of lobster thermidor.\u201d\n\nHow about when the pair entered a giant DIY store and were handed a map to get them around. \u201cBack off, son,\u201d says Victor. \u201cIt\u2019s no\u2019 a mountain range.\u201d\n\nNavid is no stranger to sarcasm either. When in hospital he wakes up and discovers his wife has come to visit. \u201cThanks for coming by, Meena.\u201d He turns to one side and adds: \u201cLook at that, she sits there for an hour and tans my grapes. It\u2019s like a family tree wi nae names on it.\u201d\n\nSURREALISM\n\nChic Murray was the master of surrealism. \"I had a tragic childhood. My parents never understood me. They were Japanese.\" Or how about, \u201cI went to the butcher's to buy a leg of lamb. \u2018Is it Scotch?\u2019, I asked. \u2018Why?\u2019 the butcher said in reply. Are you going to talk to it or eat it?\u2019. \u2018In that case, have you got any wild duck?\u2019. \u2018No\u2019, he responded, \u2018but I\u2019ve got one I could aggravate for you.'\u201d\n\nYet, Jack and Victor have their own moments of delicious absurdity. As they look down at a recently departed friend's doorstep it\u2019s covered in milk bottles, indeed it looks like a bowling alley before the first ball is thrown. Jack worries: \u201cDon\u2019t ever let this happen to me.\u201d Victor says in serious voice: \u201cI would never let that happen, Jack.\u201d He grins and adds: \u201cFor I would cancel my own milk and simply take yours.\u201d\n\nOBSERVATION\n\nScottish comedy has to be able to spot the detail, the quirkiness in life, and convey it to an audience. Kevin Bridges is a young master of the art. \u201cIt must be pretty surreal being Prince Harry and William on a stag night. Just you and your mates stuffing pictures of your gran into your lap-dancer\u2019s bra.\u201d\n\nFrankie Boyle manages to make us wince and laugh at the same time. \u201cI wonder about that woman of 63 that gave birth. That baby would not had had to force its way out. Everytime she went for a s**** it probably had to brace itself.\u201d\n\nBut Kiernan and Hemphill\u2019s Navid can always come up to scratch. When he hears his new door bells he declares, in clear conjunction with the rest of us: \u201cBrrr is sh***. Bing bong is much mair modern.\u201d\n\nJack and Victor, too, have had many astounding moments. Jack asks one afternoon: \u201cDae ye sometimes wish ye\u2019d been in the war?\u201d Victor\u2019s reply is priceless. \u201cNaw, naw. Carnage that. Runnin\u2019 aboot, wi\u2019 nae legs.\u201d\n\nWORDPLAY\n\nDon\u2019t we Scots love wordplay? We love to take the English language and run it through a mangle for comic effect, as was so wonderfully created by Stanley Baxter. It was Baxter who asked: \u201cIs it really folk dancing? Ach yes, folk dancing and enjoying themselves!\u201d\n\nBut Still Game\u2019s writers have often dropped their own bucket into the well of comedy opportunity. Jack reveals a smattering of Latin to Isa when he declares her guilty of stabbing him in the back. \u201cHe said \u2018Et tu, Isa.\u2019\u201d To which Isa replied indignantly; \u201cA never ate two of anything.\u201d\n\nVULGARITY\n\nBilly Connolly loves his little vulgarities. And so do we. How about his, \"A fart is just your arse applauding.\" Or how about his classic simile: \u201cAs welcome as a fart in a space suit.\u201d Yes, we Scots love to go to the (toilet) edge of humour, sometimes indeed falling right into the pan.\n\nIn one episode the pair appear at a whisky distillery where the expert says: \u201cDon\u2019t be shy, gentlemen. Try the McClivey. That distillery is silent now.\u201d To which Jack replies: \u201cAye, well it\u2019ll be history when it\u2019s flying out ma p***er in about an hour.\u201d\n\nAnd can you get more profane/profound when it\u2019s asked of Isa: \u201cIsa, do you mark your diary tae get right on ma tits?\u201d Perhaps when Navid says to Winston: \"So, ah hear you and Isa are pumpin'?\n\nONE LINERS\n\nConnolly\u2019s one liners were, of course, sublime. He loved the putdown. \u201cWhen they put teeth in your mouth they ruined a perfectly good bum.\u201d\n\nBut Kiernan and Hemphill, too, appreciate the value in the power to reduce to rubble, clearly learned from years of Glasgow experience and perhaps watching the best of American sitcoms. One day Jack and Victor have a go at the cut and thrust of boyish fencing and Victor declares: \u201cYou\u2019re putting on the beef, Jack.\u201d Jack doesn\u2019t hold back \u201cAye, every time I shag your wife she makes me a sandwich.\u201d\n\nSENTIMENTALITY\n\nWe Scots love our (mock) pathos. We love to let sadness seep into our souls. And Still Game offers it up by the soup ladle. But sometimes it comes with a little extra salt. When Victor saddens at the thought of his late wife, he wails: \u201cShe\u2019s still here. In my heart.\u201d But Jack has none of it. \u201cBirthday card pish,\u201d he says, in a clever attempt to keep his best friend\u2019s spirits sky high.\n\nStill Game has had it all, including great elements of farce; the pair being stuck in a lift, when Winston\u2019s leg flies off. But there is no way that it hasn\u2019t been Scottish.\n\nSorry, Billy.\n\nStill Game, the SEC Hydro, until October 13.\n\n\u201c"}}
