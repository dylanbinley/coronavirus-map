Any decision based on a vote where there is almost no difference between those for, against or absent cannot be the basis of a decision without devaluing the school, and therefore the field.\u2019\n\nThe signatories expressed their \u2018profound unease\u2019 at the vote of no confidence in Franch, whom they describe as one of the \u2019most inspired leaders and radical thinkers of a younger generation of architects\u2019.\n\nThe letter (see attached at bottom) also points out that Franch received 67 per cent of the vote when the Catalan architect \u2013 who had previously been chief curator and executive director of Storefront for Art and Architecture in New York \u2013 was appointed to the role, the biggest majority for a new director since 1990.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt goes on: \u2018We believe that Franch\u2019s potential departure from the AA so shortly after her widely publicised appointment following a long and thorough search would not only disallow Franch to pursue and carry her ideas for educational reform to fruition, but also jeopardize an institution of seminal cultural and pedagogical importance to become the subject of media frivolity.\u2019\n\nThe letter also calls on the school to consider the issues of potential gender bias: \u2018strong women that take direct and immediate action to address crises are often criticised extensively, while men enforcing similar actions are seen as effective and decisive leaders\u2019.\n\nFranch arrived shortly after the school had controversially made a series of redundancies and stopped publishing its, since-revived, AA Files to save money. The job cuts took place despite an international protest before Christmas that saw figures including Rem Koolhaas, Richard Rogers, Phyllis Lambert, Toyo Ito and Kengo Kuma calling for a U-turn and warning that the exercise could prove fatal to the institution.\n\nThe results of the confidential and electronic ballot of the school community were confirmed on Monday (29 June). The poll also revealed that 90 per cent of students and staff agreed there were \u2019structural and systemic issues\u2019 at the AA \u2019regardless of the individual or individuals responsible for its direction\u2019.\n\nLast year the AJ received a separate anonymous letter, allegedly signed by 161 members of the school community, voicing \u2019concerns regarding the current pedagogical leadership of the school\u2019.\n\nIt read: \u2018The student community also fears the school will favour theory over design, to the detriment of both, as well as some types of architectural thinking over others, which would painfully hurt the high level of diversity in architectural approaches the AA is known to offer and celebrate.\u2019\n\nA statement issued by the school in response to last week\u2019s votes reads: \u2019The AA has a long tradition of self-determination through its school community and is proud to have as part of its constitution a mechanism to facilitate discussion and debate and to vote on significant matters regarding the AA\u2019s future and direction.\n\n\u2019Council recognises the heart of the AA lies in its democratic principles and welcomes the advice of the school community expressed through its meeting and voting mechanisms to inform the governance and leadership of the association.\n\n\u2019The outcomes of the school community meeting have now been passed to council for discussion.\u2019\n\nThe AA has been contacted for a response to the latest letter."}}
