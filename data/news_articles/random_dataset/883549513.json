Selema Farms provides cattle fattening and butchery services to known brands such as Farmcrowdy, Livestockng, Jumia, Red and Green Butchery, Prince Ebeano stores, Lekki markets and several others.\n\nIn 2017, the Osun State government partnered with the farm for its O\u2019ram initiative; which sought to fatten several rams before the Eid celebrations, which was to be sold at half the market value. Sence Agric was also one of its major partners.\n\n\u201cThey were professional in their dealings with us and very prompt in paying back the money. Selema Farms made us look good to our clients, which is why we are partnering with them again for this next round of funding,\u201d said Ogo Ibok, who is the CEO of Sence Agric Limited\n\nAccording to Selema Farms\u2019 CEO, Sola Omidiran: \u201cThe industry of livestock farming is one that is untapped but very much capable of making Nigeria the giant of Africa not only in Population but also in wealth. This is the opportunity being offered by the Cowfunding by Selema Farms initiative.\u201d\n\nVANGUARD\n\nKindly Share This Story:"}}
