Not even a little bit. In fact, she managed to write a 1,000 essay about how \u201coutrageous\u201d it is that he hasn\u2019t been voted off the show.\n\n\u201cBad dancing by a nonprofessional can be disarming. It allows you to see the truth within the body that reveals character. Sean Spicer,\u201d Kourlas laments, \u201cis something worse: an untruthful dancer.\u201d She adds, \u201cMr. Spicer isn\u2019t trained, of course, but he has revealed much about his soul\u2019s weather through his dancing. He hides behind an egregious smile, parting his teeth to make it look as though he\u2019s been caught mid-laugh. That smile seems meant to distract from his plan of attack: never actually performing a dance, but conquering it.\u201d\n\nAn \u201cuntruthful dancer?\u201d An \u201cegregious smile?\u201d His \u201csoul\u2019s weather?\u201d\n\nKourlas explains what she means. \u201cWhen interlopers invade a dancer\u2019s world, it reveals much \u2014 about their psyche, their strengths and weaknesses, their essence as human beings. Are they generous? Lazy? Thoughtless? The truth comes out in the dancing.\u201d\n\nOh, now we get it.\n\nShe critiques Spicer\u2019s dancing:\n\nAs for Mr. Spicer, he\u2019s as stiff and two-dimensional as a sheet of cardboard, with feet that move as if stuck in slabs of cement and arms that look like they\u2019re still gripping the lectern. And while he acts as if he liked dancing \u2014 like he just wanted to have fun \u2014 all the \u201cSaturday Night Fever\u201d disco suits in the world can\u2019t hide how much he seems to hate it, but knows he must endure it. Watching Mr. Spicer try to wipe away some of his disgrace through dancing hurts. Yet here he is, week after week, using dance as a way to redeem his character. Giving the public the chance to laugh with him \u2014 dressed as a buffoon in that scary green ruffled shirt, dancing to \u201cSpice Up Your Life\u201d \u2014 and not at him comes off as a calculation, on his (and probably the show\u2019s) part. And Mr. Spicer\u2019s later performances have been scary in a different way, like his militaristic Paso Doble, which had a cold brutality to it.\n\nOf course, President Trump bears some responsibility for this too. After all, he \u201cencouraged people to vote for Mr. Spicer\u201d in an October 14th tweet.\n\nShe accuses the audience voters of racism. \u201cAnd in the early weeks, it was striking that the majority of the dancers whose votes put them at the bottom of the pack were black.\u201d\n\nShe also believes that sexism and ageism were responsible for former Supreme Mary Wilson being voted off the show.\n\nKourlas favorite dancer, Sailor Brinkley-Cook, was voted off the show in week 6. \u201cHer bubbly exuberance allowed her to throw herself into every dance she performed despite being wracked with insecurity. Her nerves could really fray. When she lost, she sobbed real tears, the messy kind. For me, she was the greatest surprise, both as a dancer and as a contestant on a competition show. She cared and she danced her heart out\u2026This is what Graham meant when she said movement doesn\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\nIt sounds as if Kourlas is or was a professional dancer at some point in her life and I understand how a person with expertise in a particular area might look at a newcomer\u2019s cringeworthy performance and find fault.\n\nBut Kourlas\u2019 Trump Derangement Syndrome has taken over completely here and she is reading way too much into this. It has blinded her to the simplest, most light-hearted pleasures. People don\u2019t watch \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d expecting to see what choreographer Martha Graham once described as the \u201cclean, precise, eloquent, truthful movement of a trained dancer.\u201d Most viewers merely want to be entertained. For one hour, they want to forget themselves and be amused.\n\nSometimes, life is about more than perfection, it\u2019s about spirit and joy.\n\nSpicer is having fun and apparently, the audience is having fun with him.\n\nKourlas writes that Spicer \u201chas consistently been the worst performer on \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d and asks, \u201cSo why is he still on?\u201d\n\nBecause he\u2019s Sean Spicer, dummy.\n\nThis is the single greatest opinion piece of all time. The columnist suggests that Spicer\u2019s dancing is \u201cmilitaristic,\u201d betraying a \u201ccold brutality.\u201d Seriously. https://t.co/rgUXCDiuzw \u2014 Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) November 5, 2019\n\n\n\nMBA, former financial consultant, options trader\n\nMom of three grown children, grandmother\n\nEmail Elizabeth at\n\n\n\nWriter at RedStateMBA, former financial consultant, options traderMom of three grown children, grandmotherEmail Elizabeth at [email protected] Read more by Elizabeth Vaughn"}}
