While they have not found a suspect, they said criminal charges are possible.\n\nThe district also told families the threats were in connection to a planned student-led walkout scheduled for Wednesday morning. Monogue said the threats were made against the walkout.\n\n\u201cIt makes me angry and a bit disappointed,\u201d Middleton High School senior Ace Buccholz said.\n\nBuccholz had planned to attend the rally at Fireman\u2019s Park Wednesday morning asking the district to do more to help sexual abuse survivors, but it was postponed because of the threat.\n\n\u201cIt is quite upsetting, because it felt like we were actually taking a step to changing things or getting people to notice things,\u201d Buccholz said. \u201cThen this whole debacle happened, and now it\u2019s postponed.\u201d\n\nThe social media threat put a stop to the school day, too, canceling classes at Middleton High School and Clark Street Community School.\n\n\u201cI feel like (the threat) will put quite a few people on edge,\u201d Buccholz said.\n\nIt comes at a time when school violence is top of mind.\n\n\u201cAll these incidents are hitting way too close to home, with incidents that happened in Waukesha and Oshkosh last week,\u201d Monogue said. \u201cNow our system this week. It is emotional, upsetting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always get a shooter drill every year, at least twice a year,\u201d Buccholz said. \u201cIt\u2019s normal. We usually have a teacher talk to us about it, which shouldn\u2019t be normal, but it is.\u201d\n\nWhile classes will resume Thursday, police will be present at both high schools through the end of the week, according to the district.\n\nGet your weather forecast from people who actually live in your community.
