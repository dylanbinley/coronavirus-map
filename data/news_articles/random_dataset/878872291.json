This is a big development for the massive Muslim travel market in Asia and elsewhere, as we reported below.\n\nBut it will be interesting to see whether non-Muslims will open their hearts to the kingdom. Each time Saudi Arabia loosens its restrictions \u2014 allowing non-married couples to book hotel rooms; approving that foreign women don\u2019t have to wear the flowing abaya cloak; letting Saudi women travel without male permission \u2014 the world is reminded of its authoritarian, repressive, and oppressive rule.\n\nTourists don\u2019t book and embark on trips in a political vacuum, as Skift\u2019s Global Tourism Reporter Rosie Spinks wrote recently.\n\nSo while it\u2019s understandable that businesses are excited about a new frontier, they should temper that optimism with a good dose of reality.\n\nJust ask Myanmar, which has been shamed for the Rohingya crisis by tourists simply by their refusal to visit.\n\n\u2014 Raini Hamdi, Skift Asia Editor, rh@skift.com, @RainiHamdi\n\nSkift Stories and More Expert Insights\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s New Tourism Frontier Explained: Businesses can\u2019t resist the opportunities that a new frontier brings. In the case of Saudi Arabia, however, the gamble they take is whether tourists will actually go, given the kingdom\u2019s poor image. The old adage \u2018build and they will come\u2019 is being tested.\n\nBudget Hotels Drive Southeast Asia\u2019s Online Travel Growth to $34 Billion: Like low-cost carriers before them, low-cost hotel chains are playing a big role in the growth of online travel in Southeast Asia, according to a new Google report.\n\nWhat Is the Future of Packaged Vacations After Thomas Cook\u2019s Collapse? Package holidays are changing and under pressure, but in markets such as the UK, Germany, China, and Canada, these offline options still have their place. Failure to adapt was a contributing factor in Thomas Cook\u2019s demise, but there were a whole bunch of other things going on as well.\n\nTravel Agencies Still Make 7 Times More in Commissions Than Fees: The travel advisor industry in the U.S. has made tremendous headway in charging fees for service, but there is still progress to be made. Here are a few good points for Asia\u2019s travel agencies on how not to be afraid in charging fees.\n\nTravel Advisors Step In as Cruise Fees Reach Tipping Point: The base fares advertised by many cruise lines rarely indicate the proliferation of onboard charges that can send the cost of the cruise soaring. Travel advisors are stepping in by counseling clients about the added costs and, in some cases, presenting all-inclusive cruises as a better value.\n\nCatch Skift Global Forum 2019 Interviews, Now on Video: It\u2019s not too late to join the party.
