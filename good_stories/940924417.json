By May 22, the North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, the West Midlands, the South East and the East of England registered more deaths than the capital.\n\nDespite falling cases nationwide, on June 29 Leicester became the first city in Britain to be plunged back into lockdown after public health officials expressed alarm at a significant rise in positive Covid-19 tests. Nearly 1,000 cases were reported in the city in two weeks.", "METADATA": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2c769d", "msapplication-TileImage": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "The Telegraph", "msapplication-config": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-70x70.png", "description": "Since the first Covid-19 cases were detected in York, the disease has now spread across the UK - find out how many cases are in your area", "keywords": "World Health Organisation,Standard,Department for Health &amp; Social Care,Global Health Security,Data story,Coronavirus", "tmgads.channel": "news", "tmgads.section": "news-2020", "tmgads.zone": "news.2020.08.15", "tmgads.articleid": "At62G6RSPstf", "tmgads.pagetype": "story", "tmgads.level": 5, "tmgads.geo": "US", "tmgads.keywords": "World Health Organisation,Standard,Department for Health &amp; Social Care,Global Health Security,Data story,Coronavirus", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.Category": 2020, "DCSext.Genre": 8, "DCSext.MLC": "/news/2020/08/15", "DCSext.articleId": "At62G6RSPstf", "DCSext.Content_Type": "story", "DCSext.Level": 5, "DCSext.author": "Dominic Gilbert; Ashley Kirk; Bruno Riddy", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2020-08-15 09:09", "DCSext.cf": 0, "DCSext.cd": 0, "DCSext.cn": 0, "DCSext.pd": 1, "og": {"title": "Coronavirus in the UK: The latest numbers of confirmed cases and deaths", "description": "Since the first Covid-19 cases were detected in York, the disease has now spread across the UK - find out how many cases are in your area", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Telegraph", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/08/15/uk-coronavirus-cases-deaths-today-latest-covid-numbers/", "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/04/DATA-UK-CORONAVIRUS-UK-tracker1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpg?impolicy=logo-overlay"}, "twitter": {"title": "Coronavirus in the UK: The latest numbers of confirmed cases and deaths", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/08/15/uk-coronavirus-cases-deaths-today-latest-covid-numbers/", "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/04/DATA-UK-CORONAVIRUS-UK-tracker1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "site": "@TelegraphNews", "description": "Since the first Covid-19 cases were detected in York, the disease has now spread across the UK - find out how many cases are in your area", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "tmgads.businessSegment": "news", "tmg.premium.override": "true", "tmg.premium.state": "false", "premiumContentOnFirstPublish": "true", "article": {"content_tier": "free"}, "fb": {"pages": 122346694516955}, "theme-color": "#072A3A", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#072A3A", "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:standard,max-video-preview:-1"}}}
