Asked whether testing at the airport upon arrival to the UK could replace quarantine measures, Mr Shapps replied: \"Testing on return is something that we've always said we'd keep a very close eye behind the science on those things. \"Testing on return isn't quite as straightforward as it sounds because if you test someone who is asymptomatic, in other words they don't think they've got anything but they may in fact have it on day one on their return, we'd probably only capture a very small percentage, scientists suggest perhaps only 7 percent, of actual cases. \"Now, clearly you need a system there is more accurate than that before you can say to people you've now been tested and you don't need to quarantine.\" READ MORE: Shapps on the spot as Britons rush back to avoid quarantine\n\nFrance quarantine rules cannot be replaced by testing at airport, says Shapps\n\nFrance quarantine: Grant Shapps said UK had no choice but introduce new measures\n\nMr Shapps said it is important that all travellers returning to the UK fill in a passenger locator form. The Transport Secretary told BBC Breakfast: \"The reality is that in all of the things to do with coronavirus, there always has had to be a cut-off and we've seen this throughout, haven't we, in the way that rules have had to be implemented and, so, 'if we can do this, why can't we do that?', that's always going to be the case. \"What we have to do is provide clear guidance and, in this case, clear law in order to require people to quarantine. \"I just want to stress it is very important that people do quarantine. Everybody returning to the UK, no matter where from, doesn't matter whether you're in a travel corridor country or a quarantine country, must at this stage fill in a passenger locator form.\n\n\"That is the law and you may well find that people call up to check where you are, and you'll be breaking the law if you were not quarantining, if that was a requirement for the country you'd come from.\" Travellers trying to return from France on Friday to avoid the quarantine restrictions face paying hundreds of pounds. British Airways is charging \u00a3452 for the cheapest tickets to fly direct from Paris to London Heathrow. The same journey on Saturday can be made with the airline for just \u00a366. The cheapest ticket on a Eurostar train from Paris to London is \u00a3210, compared with \u00a3165 on Saturday.
