It's been a worldwide, monthslong trip around the world made possible by the kindness of strangers.\n\nPip's family -- the Eilbecks -- are a sailing family: Zoe, Guy and their two children. They were in Key West back in March, Zoe Eilbeck told \"Good Morning America,\" when Key West made the decision that all visitors must depart within 48 hours. They took five days and sailed up the east coast to Hilton Head, South Carolina. Then, Australia closed its borders, and the family knew they needed to get home immediately.\n\nIt was then they were separated from Pip and the start of her long journey home.\n\nPHOTO: Lynn Williams was the first person to give Pip a place to stay when her family had to fly to Australia without her.

Pets also must fly cargo into Australia and quarantine upon arrival. Because of the speed at which flights had to be booked and decisions made -- plus the very long trip to Australia for tiny Pip in cargo -- the family thought Pip would be better off in the safety of their friend. The family drove to Atlanta, flew to Los Angeles, and got on the last flight to Australia before the borders closed.\n\nPHOTO: Ellen Steinberg and Pip. Ellen was the 'captain' of the relay team that got Pip home. (Ellen Steinberg) More\n\n\"At this point we thought we were leaving her for 4 to 6 weeks and this whole thing would blow over,\" Zoe Eilbeck said. \"But given the kids, we thought we should get home and then we would come back to get Pip.\"\n\nBut soon the family realized things were about to get much more complicated.\n\nWilliams posted on NextDoor and became connected with Ellen Steinberg. Steinberg volunteers at a local animal shelter and when it became clear she would be staying home for a few months, decided to foster a dog.\n\nPHOTO: Stacey Green and Pip.
