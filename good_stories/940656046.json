We cannot afford to let our economy slide,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Serious Battle\u2019\n\nEven though the country has had fewer cases of the virus for weeks running, Mr Mustapha has called for caution, warning that it should not be \u201cmisconstrued for victory\u201d as there is still \u201ca serious battle to be fought.\u201d\n\nGlobal Tally\n\nThe novel coronavirus has killed at least 585,750 people since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP at 1900 GMT on Thursday.\n\nAt least 13,660,780 cases of coronavirus have been registered in 196 countries and territories. Of these, at least 7,442,700 are now considered recovered.\n\nThe tallies, using data collected by AFP from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization (WHO), probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections.\n\nMany countries are testing only symptomatic or the most serious cases.\n\nSince 1900 GMT on Wednesday, 5,604 new deaths and 236,985 new cases were recorded worldwide. The countries with the newest deaths were Brazil with 1,233 new deaths, followed by the United States with 997, and India with 606.\n\nThe United States is the worst-hit country with 137,897 deaths from 3,536,658 cases. At least 1,075,882 people have been declared recovered.\n\nAfter the US, the hardest-hit countries are Brazil with 75,366 deaths from 1,966,748 cases, the United Kingdom with 45,119 deaths from 2,925,52 cases, Mexico with 36,906 deaths from 317,635 cases, and Italy with 35,017 deaths from 243,736 cases.", "METADATA": {"google-site-verification": "6JVFjvtKtlBAOBeZjx02KYOCAJqmYfH--9_EmfNIsw8", "alexaVerifyID": "s6Y-9oImS488Fgxe-Oc84mxGsd8", "msvalidate.01": "51A9C00FE7BE8C94DDAE034F74141D4A", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=674628071", "theme-color": "#00265E", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#00265E", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 Cases Cross 48,000 With 373 New Infections", "description": "Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 Cases Cross 48,000 With 373 New Infections", "image": "https://www.channelstv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/covid-19-nigeria-update.jpg", "url": "https://www.channelstv.com/2020/08/13/nigerias-covid-19-cases-cross-48000-with-373-new-infections/", "site_name": "Channels Television"}, "fb": {"app_id": 205604876116272}, "application-name": "Channels Television", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "small.jpg", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "medium.jpg", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "wide.jpg", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "large.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00265E", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.1"}}}
