All share huge farm economies that require thousands of farm workers living and working in close proximity, Inslee said.\n\n\u201cThe hot spots have followed the harvest pattern,\u201d Inslee said, moving from the Oregon border to the Canadian border.", "METADATA": {"description": "SPOKANE \u2014 Gov.
