       "The government imposed a travel restriction denying re-entry to long-term and permanent foreign residents who departed Japan on April 3 and after (the date depends on the country they went to). While on Aug. 5 the government started allowing the re-entry of those who departed Japan before the designated dates, restrictions are still in place for foreign residents who departed after that. The government has also stopped issuing new visas to foreign nationals wishing to enter Japan for the first time, including foreign students, putting them in limbo.\n",

       "Cerniauskas should have been a success story in Japan’s push to internationalize its student bodies, something that has been a stated policy aim of the government since 1983. In 2008, a goal was established to have 300,000 non-Japanese students in Japan by 2020.\n",

       "\n",
       "This figure has already been surpassed, in part due to the government subsidizing universities’ efforts to develop and change programs to better appeal to overseas students. Non-Japanese students accounted for 7.8 percent of all students in higher education in Japan as of May 2019.\n",
       "\n",
       "With the number of college-aged Japanese falling, these international students represent an attractive revenue source for Japanese universities.\n",

       "\n",
       "And as in the case of someone like Cerniauskas, bringing highly talented people from around the world can enhance universities’ research capabilities. Non-Japanese students who remain in Japan after graduation also represent an important source of potential labor for Japanese companies faced with a shrinking talent pool and seeking to hire new graduates with technical and foreign language skills.\n",

       "\n",
       "Universities “will lose momentum in this competition because the image will be established that students cannot come to Japan or might be excluded from coming back at any time,” she says.\n",
       "\n",
       "Some of Japan’s competitors for international students are still keeping international students out, including Australia and New Zealand. But others have allowed new students to enter for the fall semester, including Singapore, the U.S. (as long as curriculums have an in-person component) and Taiwan (except for students from China). South Korea is permitting students to enter, but the government is encouraging them to stay in their home countries and study online instead for the fall semester.\n",
       "\n",
       "Miho Odagiri, an official at the education ministry’s office for student exchange, says that it is difficult at this time to say exactly when new students will be able to enter Japan. She emphasizes that the ministry is working to convey to other parts of the government the importance of non-Japanese students and faculty, in hopes that they will be able to enter the country soon.\n",

       "Elin McCready, an American who is a professor in the Department of English at Aoyama Gakuin University, was abroad for research travel and was stuck outside the country for over three months this spring. She has several invitations to go to Europe this fall and funding from German institutions for travel there for talks and joint research.\n",

       "The situation makes her feel that her research activities’ status is “quite unstable and worrisome,” which she believes would not be the case if she were Japanese and did not face the same restriction on her movements.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I would have a hard time recommending people to feel confident moving here to do research given what I have seen in the past months, which is something I wouldn’t have said before this, as I have found Japan quite a supportive research environment,” she says.\n",

       "“On a daily basis, I wait, I check the news, I read, watch MOFA (Foreign Ministry) press conferences, I consult friends from other countries and inquire,” he says. For now, he says, “it’s all dark, and it’s getting darker.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Ouadi hopes to find out whether he can come to Japan as scheduled to begin his studies for a master’s in the management of technology at the University of Tokyo’s School of Engineering this fall. He’s worried now that his studies may be postponed or canceled.\n",

       "\n",
       "He has been told by the university that his first semester isn’t canceled, but he doesn’t know when he can go to Japan. “It could be near the end of September, the end of the year or not at all for the first semester if Japan doesn’t reopen its borders.” He describes the situation as “definitely frustrating.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Because the university has told him that there could be lessons in person near the end of September, he has to prepare to go to Japan if it becomes possible, but he also has to prepare to stay in France if needed. This presents logistical quandaries, including what to do about the accommodation he is renting in Strasbourg.\n",

       "Scheduled to begin as a research student in the graduate Humanities Department of Kyushu University this past April, Streifer has been waiting since then to find out when she can enter Japan. Stuck in her native France, she has been taking online classes in hopes of being able to get to Japan.\n",
       "\n",
       "“The situation has taken quite a toll on me,” she says. “I had already quit my job and am past the period where you can apply for jobs in my region. I have virtually no income since April as the MEXT scholarship stipends are only for those who are in Japan, regardless of whether you take online classes or not.”\n",
       "\n",
       "As a result of the stress, she has experienced health problems including nosebleeds, insomnia, and paralysis of her arm.\n",
       "\n",
       "To make matters worse, Streifer reports that “communication has been near nonexistent. We do not have direct contact with MEXT as it always goes through our embassy, and we honestly did not get much guidance or information, as they mostly told us they were left in the dark just like the rest of us.”"

       "What we in Iran — the target of a vicious and indiscriminate sanctions regime — have seen from the current US administration is quite straightforward: there is no grand vision for an alternative global community. The US’ fickleness and unpredictability have nothing to do with masterful implementation of game theory. Rather whether it comes to its (mis)management of Covid-19 at home or its undermining of peace and stability abroad, the current regime in Washington has no real plan except to frontally assault those who stand by the rule of law.\n",
       "\n",
       "The US handling of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorsed — and is inseparable from — the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, is a case in point.\n",
       "\n",
       "In July 2015, Iran, the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany signed a landmark agreement to satisfy any concerns over the exclusively peaceful nature of our nuclear program while relieving the Iranian people of inhumane and unjust sanctions. As part of the JCPOA, the US and other signatories also jointly co-sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which embraces the nuclear deal — and to which its full 90 pages are attached, thus enshrining the accord into international law.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, in May of 2018, the US administration declared that it had unilaterally opted for “ceasing participation” in the JCPOA. Since then, Iran and the rest of the international community have been left in the extraordinary position of watching the US become the first government in UN history that not just violates a binding resolution it itself sponsored, but also punish those governments and companies that uphold international law by implementing its provisions.\n",
       "\n",
       "As I warned the Security Council last month, this status quo is neither desirable nor sustainable. We are thus at a crossroads.\n",
       "\n",
       "Also read: The US can’t have it both ways over Iran\n",
       "\n",
       "The ‘might makes right’ standard\n",
       "\n",
       "The US administration’s disinformation campaign — including false and forged claims regarding a regional consensus — about the consequences of the remaining signatories to the JCPOA upholding the deal’s provisions, including normalising Iran’s defence cooperation with the world in October, is a ruse to disguise its real, more malevolent motivations: having failed to collapse Resolution 2231 after over two years of the most brutal “maximum pressure” ever imposed on a nation — including depriving ordinary Iranians of access to medicines and medical equipment amid the deadliest <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>pandem</b></span>ic the world has seen in many decades — the US now hopes to abuse its mal-interpretation of the provisions of the same resolution it abandoned in 2018 to finally destroy it. This deeply malicious US behaviour is evident throughout the UN, where it seeks to use the UN itself to effectively destroy the world body.\n",

       "There are several key issues and consequences to consider in this equation.\n",
       "\n",
       "First and foremost, one may wonder why or how the collapse of a single UN Security Council resolution on a niche subject relates to the bigger picture. It does, for most notably it would be a generational setback for the cause of multilateralism should the Security Council be bullied into torpedoing its own resolution. Unless all powers respect the principles which the Council was created to embody, it cannot perform its duties, nor can any nation acknowledge its authority.\n",
       "\n",
       "We should not forget that the same US regime has fatuously also withdrawn from the WHO amid the worst global <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>pandem</b></span>ic, but now seeks to lead the WHO reform process, to the chagrin of its closest Western allies.\n",
       "\n",
       "If the US is allowed to continue on this path, the world will slide backwards toward a ‘might makes right’ standard. And while this may sound appealing to Cold Warriors looking for new targets, even that standard has its limits. For both superpowers of the past century witnessed the unraveling of their international influence in their military defeat in Afghanistan, a country with a GDP that is 14 times smaller than Apple Inc.’s annual revenue.\n",

       "We have also seen in past years how the US administration has — in parallel with its assault on international institutions and accords — sought to supplant international law with its own domestic laws. In practice, this has meant that it is now the US Treasury and not European national governments which decides with whom European companies can do business — be it under Resolution 2231 or their own North Stream gas lifeline.\n",
       "\n",
       "While it has so far primarily been the US that has sought to expand the jurisdiction of its domestic laws, there is nothing to suggest that it will retain a monopoly on it. With the opening of this Pandora’s box and with complacency on the part of some national governments, it is not difficult to imagine a future where ordinary citizens and private enterprises alike may end up having to contend with the extra-territorial application of multiple and growing series of domestic laws — debilitating international travel, trade and investment in a retrograde step for our globalised world.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus, the international community in general — and the UN Security Council in particular face an important decision: do we maintain respect for the rule of law, or do we return to the law of the jungle?\n",
       "\n",
       "While Iran has proven its resilience and decisive response to coercive bullying, I am confident that — in the next few critical weeks and months — members of the Security Council will refute the campaign struggle of a beleaguered US administration to turn what was the diplomatic achievement of the 21st Century into an exercise in futility, and in the process annihilate what is left of multilateralism and international law.\n",

       "\n",
       "It has been a tradition of the French Fifth Republic, whose 42nd government in just 62 years was established in early July, that when things are going badly for a president, the scapegoat is his prime minister. Indeed, there has been such an inevitability to this sequence of events over the years that one begins to wonder why anyone takes the job. To be booted out for your own incompetence is something many officials can just about reconcile themselves to, at least eventually; to be fired on account of somebody else’s, even in the ultra-cynical world of politics, is a bitter business indeed.\n",
       "\n",
       "It takes an arrogant, or supremely self-confident, president to ignore this tradition, and not to use the opportunity presented by a reshuffle to look tough and innovative by putting in a new man or woman as managing director to your own chief executive. Nicolas Sarkozy, inevitably, was one such man. He kept the same prime minister for the whole of his quinquennat, even though he and that man often had a combustible relationship, and the latter now and again threatened to walk out.\n",
       "\n",
       "Also, his prime minister was often more popular than he was, gave the impression of being more competent and even, most of the time, being more honest. Ironically, as many of you will recall, that prime minister was François Fillon, who now awaits the judgment of France’s court of appeal before discovering whether or not he will soon gain first-hand experience of the country’s penal system. However, it is doubtful Sarko would have won had he changed that particular horse in mid-stream: his presidency, not least because of his often emetic character, was flawed beyond rescue by any mere prime minister.\n",
       "\n",
       "François Hollande, however, reinstituted the tradition, getting through three premiers in his five chaotic years in the Elysée Palace; and just over three years into his presidency Emmanuel Macron too has succumbed, replacing Edouard Philippe with Jean Castex. M Philippe returns to Le Havre as mayor, the post he held for seven years before going to Matignon.\n",
       "\n",
       "He did the best possible job he could as prime minister, faced with a president whose idealist approach to politics turned out to be easier to execute in theory than in practice, and who was forced into various compromises, U-turns and even the occasional unwelcome act of coercion, forcing measures through the legislature that it was otherwise determined not to pass.\n",

       "French PM announces new crime-fighting measures\n",
       "\n",
       "An overhaul brewing\n",
       "\n",
       "M Macron’s pop-up party of 2017, La République en Marche, has in recent months haemorrhaged not only notional support in the country, as governments do in mid-term, but has also lost support in the Assemblée Nationale. Even more worrying for M. Macron will have been the suggestion that M. Philippe, a more technocratic figure, with more charm than that label suggests but without a personality cult, was more widely liked by French voters than the president was. In such circumstances but one course of action was feasible: M Philippe had to go. This had been brewing for months; M Philippe signalled his intention to contest the Le Havre mayoralty at the end of January.\n",
       "\n",
       "M Castex is a different proposition. Like his predecessor his roots are on the right, as a former member of Les Républicains, which will only confirm the suspicions many LREM activists harbour that M Macron is determined to move his party in that direction, either pushing Les Républicains so far to the right themselves that they become unelectable, or replacing that party altogether. In French politics, such things are easily possible.\n",
       "\n",
       "M Castex, as his surname might suggest, is a Catalan, and from the opposite end of the Hexagon to M Philippe: for 12 years before his elevation he was Mayor of Prades, just inland from Perpignan, a few miles from the Spanish border; he was born in the deep south, but much further east, at Vic-Fezensac, not far from Pau.\n",
       "\n",
       "M Castex has had a distinguished bureaucratic career that began in the nurseries of Sciences-Po and ENA; he served as a ministerial chief of staff during the Sarkozy years and was called in during April by M Macron to design France’s programme to get out of <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>lockdown</b></span> after the Covid-19 crisis – a responsibility that, if France endures a second spike of the disease, could yet come back to haunt him.\n",
       "\n",
       "But M Castex landed that job because he was regarded as a safe pair of hands; and for the same reason he became prime minister. Charisma, at least in his interface with the general public, does not appear to be his strong suit. He has a long civil service background – he sat for the years on the Cour des Comptes, or Court of Audit, examining the efficiency of government departments, and even if he is dull he is far from stupid or inexperienced. What he will not do is distract attention, in the run-up to the 2022 election, from a president seeking re-election; but M Macron hope to be able to rely on him to keep matters in government under control while he seeks a second mandate.\n",

       "That, though, is likely to be a tall order. Because of the Covid-19 <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>pandem</b></span>ic France faces its worst economic crisis since the Fourth Republic, and quite possibly since the Third. Some very hard decisions will have to be taken about public spending that are likely to compound the sense of despair and bewilderment brought on by private sector job losses.\n",
       "\n",
       "It remains to be seen whether an ultra-technocrat such as M Castex has the political skill to present such unpleasant news to the people of France without destabilising M Macron. With Rachida Dati now circling and Marine Le Pen increasingly vocal, the fight in 2022 promises to be less predictable than many have thought. M Castex may find the task ahead beyond even his indubitable level of competence."

       "– In a major breakthrough, Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed to normalize relations between the two Middle East countries on Thursday, in a deal brokered by the United States. To achieve the historic understanding, Israel would halt plans to annex the highly strategic Golan Heights. The two countries will co-operate on energy, water and environmental issues, as well working jointly on a <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>COVID</b></span>-19 <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>vaccine</b></span>. Reports stated the UAE was willing to make such a dramatic move out of concerns over Iran’s increasing influence in the region. Iran, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority denounced the deal, with Oman, Bahrain, and Egypt were among the dozens of countries that voiced their support. Israel has maintained peace agreements with Egypt since 1979 and Jordan since 1994.\n",

       "– Ahead of the next round of extradition hearings beginning on Aug. 17 in Vancouver, lawyers for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou said on Friday that they are seeking access to hundreds of confidential documents. Meng’s defence contends there was an abuse of process during her December 2018 arrest, alleging there was a “co-ordinated state misconduct” between Canadian and U.S. officials. Earlier this year Canadian officials turned over 400 pages of documents, of which many contained redactions. The Canadian government said divulging all of the information would have violated confidentiality agreements with clients and third parties. The U.S. is seeking to extradite Meng to face charges regarding bank fraud.\n",
       "\n",
       "– Reports stated on Friday that the U.S. seized four tankers bound for Venezuela in May and July that were allegedly transporting 1.1 million barrels of gasoline from Iran. However, Iran denounced the allegations as being U.S. propaganda and said the tankers were not Iranian. Despite having some of the largest oil reserves in the world, Venezuela lacks the refining capacity to supply its own fuel needs. Sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Venezuela have made it difficult for the country to earn revenue from oil exports."

Israel and the UAE also have been among Trump&#x27;s closest foreign allies.\n",
       "\n",
       "For Israel, the announcement comes after years of boasting by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that his government enjoys closer ties to Arab nations than publicly acknowledged. Netanyahu has sought to build settlements on lands sought by the Palestinians and embraced a Trump proposal that would allow him to annex large parts of the occupied West Bank while granting Palestinians limited autonomy in other areas.\n",

       "For the UAE, home to skyscraper-studded Dubai and the rolling, oil-rich sand dunes of Abu Dhabi, it further burnishes its international campaign to be seen as a beacon of tolerance in the Middle East despite being governed by autocratic rulers.

       "\n",
       "And for the Palestinians, who long have relied on Arab backing in their struggle for independence, the announcement marked both a win and setback.

       "\n",
       "In addition to Trump, the main U.S. mediators for agreement were the president’s senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner, special Mideast envoy Avi Berkowitz and David Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel.\n",
       "\n",
       "The UAE is a U.S.-allied federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula. Formed in 1971, the country like other Arab nations at the time did not recognize Israel over its occupation of land home to the Palestinians.\n",

       "The UAE relied on white-collar Palestinians in creating its nation. Over time, it maintained its stance that Israel allow the creation of a Palestinian state on land it seized in the 1967 war.\n",
       "\n",
       "But in recent years, ties between Gulf Arab nations and Israel have quietly grown, in part over their shared enmity of Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

       "The UAE&#x27;s state-run WAM news agency acknowledged the deal, framing it as not just a move that helps the UAE and Israel, but one that also carries benefits for the Palestinians. Top Emirati official Anwar Gargash said the move dealt a “death blow” to moves by Israel to annex Palestinian lands.\n",
       "\n",
       "It remains unclear what prompted Israel and the UAE to make the announcement now. In June, the United Arab Emirates’ ambassador to the U.S. warned in an Israeli newspaper op-ed that Israel’s planned annexing the Jordan Valley and other parts of the occupied West Bank would “upend” Israel’s efforts to improve ties with Arab nations.\n",
       "\n",
       "The agreement gives Netanyahu a domestic boost at a time when Israel’s shaky coalition government is plagued by infighting and facing the possibility of early elections in the coming months.

       "Netanyahu also delivered a valuable diplomatic achievement to his good friend, Trump, ahead of U.S. elections.\n",
       "\n",
       "Still, by dropping the annexation plan Netanyahu may be hedging his bets ahead of a possible change in the White House. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has made clear that he would oppose any moves by Israel to unilaterally redraw the Mideast map and annex lands sought by the Palestinians.\n",
       "\n",
       "Netanyahu also risked criticism inside his own hard-line Likud Party, whose members strongly supported annexation. Netanyahu appears to be betting that Likud members — and the small, but influential settler movement — will agree the peace agreement delivers more benefits than unilateral annexation. Opinion polls have shown that annexation is not a high priority for the vast majority of the Israeli public.\n",
       "\n",
       "Abandoning its annexation plan changes little on the ground. Israel already holds overall control of the West Bank and continues to expand its settlements there, while granting the Palestinians autonomy in a series of disconnected enclaves. Some 500,000 Israelis now live in the rapidly expanding West Bank settlements.\n",

       "Next year, Israel will take part in the UAE’s delayed Expo 2020, the world’s fair being hosted by Dubai. A secret synagogue also draws practicing Jews in Dubai.

       "\n",
       "It has been a tradition of the French Fifth Republic, whose 42nd government in just 62 years was established in early July, that when things are going badly for a president, the scapegoat is his prime minister. Indeed, there has been such an inevitability to this sequence of events over the years that one begins to wonder why anyone takes the job. To be booted out for your own incompetence is something many officials can just about reconcile themselves to, at least eventually; to be fired on account of somebody else’s, even in the ultra-cynical world of politics, is a bitter business indeed.\n",
       "\n",
       "It takes an arrogant, or supremely self-confident, president to ignore this tradition, and not to use the opportunity presented by a reshuffle to look tough and innovative by putting in a new man or woman as managing director to your own chief executive. Nicolas Sarkozy, inevitably, was one such man. He kept the same prime minister for the whole of his quinquennat, even though he and that man often had a combustible relationship, and the latter now and again threatened to walk out.\n",
       "\n",
       "Also, his prime minister was often more popular than he was, gave the impression of being more competent and even, most of the time, being more honest. Ironically, as many of you will recall, that prime minister was François Fillon, who now awaits the judgment of France’s court of appeal before discovering whether or not he will soon gain first-hand experience of the country’s penal system. However, it is doubtful Sarko would have won had he changed that particular horse in mid-stream: his presidency, not least because of his often emetic character, was flawed beyond rescue by any mere prime minister.\n",
       "\n",
       "François Hollande, however, reinstituted the tradition, getting through three premiers in his five chaotic years in the Elysée Palace; and just over three years into his presidency Emmanuel Macron too has succumbed, replacing Edouard Philippe with Jean Castex. M Philippe returns to Le Havre as mayor, the post he held for seven years before going to Matignon.\n",
       "\n",
       "He did the best possible job he could as prime minister, faced with a president whose idealist approach to politics turned out to be easier to execute in theory than in practice, and who was forced into various compromises, U-turns and even the occasional unwelcome act of coercion, forcing measures through the legislature that it was otherwise determined not to pass.\n",

       "An overhaul brewing\n",
       "\n",
       "M Macron’s pop-up party of 2017, La République en Marche, has in recent months haemorrhaged not only notional support in the country, as governments do in mid-term, but has also lost support in the Assemblée Nationale. Even more worrying for M. Macron will have been the suggestion that M. Philippe, a more technocratic figure, with more charm than that label suggests but without a personality cult, was more widely liked by French voters than the president was. In such circumstances but one course of action was feasible: M Philippe had to go. This had been brewing for months; M Philippe signalled his intention to contest the Le Havre mayoralty at the end of January.\n",
       "\n",
       "M Castex is a different proposition. Like his predecessor his roots are on the right, as a former member of Les Républicains, which will only confirm the suspicions many LREM activists harbour that M Macron is determined to move his party in that direction, either pushing Les Républicains so far to the right themselves that they become unelectable, or replacing that party altogether. In French politics, such things are easily possible.\n",
       "\n",
       "M Castex, as his surname might suggest, is a Catalan, and from the opposite end of the Hexagon to M Philippe: for 12 years before his elevation he was Mayor of Prades, just inland from Perpignan, a few miles from the Spanish border; he was born in the deep south, but much further east, at Vic-Fezensac, not far from Pau.\n",
       "\n",
       "M Castex has had a distinguished bureaucratic career that began in the nurseries of Sciences-Po and ENA; he served as a ministerial chief of staff during the Sarkozy years and was called in during April by M Macron to design France’s programme to get out of <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>lockdown</b></span> after the Covid-19 crisis – a responsibility that, if France endures a second spike of the disease, could yet come back to haunt him.\n",
       "\n",
       "But M Castex landed that job because he was regarded as a safe pair of hands; and for the same reason he became prime minister. Charisma, at least in his interface with the general public, does not appear to be his strong suit. He has a long civil service background – he sat for the years on the Cour des Comptes, or Court of Audit, examining the efficiency of government departments, and even if he is dull he is far from stupid or inexperienced. What he will not do is distract attention, in the run-up to the 2022 election, from a president seeking re-election; but M Macron hope to be able to rely on him to keep matters in government under control while he seeks a second mandate.\n",

Because of the Covid-19 <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>pandem</b></span>ic France faces its worst economic crisis since the Fourth Republic, and quite possibly since the Third. Some very hard decisions will have to be taken about public spending that are likely to compound the sense of despair and bewilderment brought on by private sector job losses.\n",
       "\n",
       "It remains to be seen whether an ultra-technocrat such as M Castex has the political skill to present such unpleasant news to the people of France without destabilising M Macron. With Rachida Dati now circling and Marine Le Pen increasingly vocal, the fight in 2022 promises to be less predictable than many have thought. M Castex may find the task ahead beyond even his indubitable level of competence."

       "– In a major breakthrough, Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed to normalize relations between the two Middle East countries on Thursday, in a deal brokered by the United States. To achieve the historic understanding, Israel would halt plans to annex the highly strategic Golan Heights. The two countries will co-operate on energy, water and environmental issues, as well working jointly on a <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>COVID</b></span>-19 <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>vaccine</b></span>. Reports stated the UAE was willing to make such a dramatic move out of concerns over Iran’s increasing influence in the region. Iran, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority denounced the deal, with Oman, Bahrain, and Egypt were among the dozens of countries that voiced their support.

       "– Ahead of the next round of extradition hearings beginning on Aug. 17 in Vancouver, lawyers for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou said on Friday that they are seeking access to hundreds of confidential documents. Meng’s defence contends there was an abuse of process during her December 2018 arrest, alleging there was a “co-ordinated state misconduct” between Canadian and U.S. officials. Earlier this year Canadian officials turned over 400 pages of documents, of which many contained redactions. The Canadian government said divulging all of the information would have violated confidentiality agreements with clients and third parties.

Despite having some of the largest oil reserves in the world, Venezuela lacks the refining capacity to supply its own fuel needs. Sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Venezuela have made it difficult for the country to earn revenue from oil exports."

       "What we in Iran — the target of a vicious and indiscriminate sanctions regime — have seen from the current US administration is quite straightforward: there is no grand vision for an alternative global community. The US’ fickleness and unpredictability have nothing to do with masterful implementation of game theory. Rather whether it comes to its (mis)management of Covid-19 at home or its undermining of peace and stability abroad, the current regime in Washington has no real plan except to frontally assault those who stand by the rule of law.\n",
       "\n",
       "The US handling of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorsed — and is inseparable from — the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, is a case in point.\n",
       "\n",
       "In July 2015, Iran, the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany signed a landmark agreement to satisfy any concerns over the exclusively peaceful nature of our nuclear program while relieving the Iranian people of inhumane and unjust sanctions. As part of the JCPOA, the US and other signatories also jointly co-sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which embraces the nuclear deal — and to which its full 90 pages are attached, thus enshrining the accord into international law.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, in May of 2018, the US administration declared that it had unilaterally opted for “ceasing participation” in the JCPOA. Since then, Iran and the rest of the international community have been left in the extraordinary position of watching the US become the first government in UN history that not just violates a binding resolution it itself sponsored, but also punish those governments and companies that uphold international law by implementing its provisions.\n",
       "\n",
       "As I warned the Security Council last month, this status quo is neither desirable nor sustainable. We are thus at a crossroads.\n",

       "The US administration’s disinformation campaign — including false and forged claims regarding a regional consensus — about the consequences of the remaining signatories to the JCPOA upholding the deal’s provisions, including normalising Iran’s defence cooperation with the world in October, is a ruse to disguise its real, more malevolent motivations: having failed to collapse Resolution 2231 after over two years of the most brutal “maximum pressure” ever imposed on a nation — including depriving ordinary Iranians of access to medicines and medical equipment amid the deadliest <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>pandem</b></span>ic the world has seen in many decades — the US now hopes to abuse its mal-interpretation of the provisions of the same resolution it abandoned in 2018 to finally destroy it. This deeply malicious US behaviour is evident throughout the UN, where it seeks to use the UN itself to effectively destroy the world body.\n",

       "There are several key issues and consequences to consider in this equation.\n",
       "\n",
       "First and foremost, one may wonder why or how the collapse of a single UN Security Council resolution on a niche subject relates to the bigger picture. It does, for most notably it would be a generational setback for the cause of multilateralism should the Security Council be bullied into torpedoing its own resolution. Unless all powers respect the principles which the Council was created to embody, it cannot perform its duties, nor can any nation acknowledge its authority.\n",
       "\n",
       "We should not forget that the same US regime has fatuously also withdrawn from the WHO amid the worst global <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>pandem</b></span>ic, but now seeks to lead the WHO reform process, to the chagrin of its closest Western allies.\n",
       "\n",
       "If the US is allowed to continue on this path, the world will slide backwards toward a ‘might makes right’ standard. And while this may sound appealing to Cold Warriors looking for new targets, even that standard has its limits. For both superpowers of the past century witnessed the unraveling of their international influence in their military defeat in Afghanistan, a country with a GDP that is 14 times smaller than Apple Inc.’s annual revenue.\n",

       "\n",
       "Attempts to replace international law with domestic law\n",
       "\n",
       "We have also seen in past years how the US administration has — in parallel with its assault on international institutions and accords — sought to supplant international law with its own domestic laws. In practice, this has meant that it is now the US Treasury and not European national governments which decides with whom European companies can do business — be it under Resolution 2231 or their own North Stream gas lifeline.\n",
       "\n",
       "While it has so far primarily been the US that has sought to expand the jurisdiction of its domestic laws, there is nothing to suggest that it will retain a monopoly on it. With the opening of this Pandora’s box and with complacency on the part of some national governments, it is not difficult to imagine a future where ordinary citizens and private enterprises alike may end up having to contend with the extra-territorial application of multiple and growing series of domestic laws — debilitating international travel, trade and investment in a retrograde step for our globalised world.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus, the international community in general — and the UN Security Council in particular face an important decision: do we maintain respect for the rule of law, or do we return to the law of the jungle?\n",
       "\n",
       "While Iran has proven its resilience and decisive response to coercive bullying, I am confident that — in the next few critical weeks and months — members of the Security Council will refute the campaign struggle of a beleaguered US administration to turn what was the diplomatic achievement of the 21st Century into an exercise in futility, and in the process annihilate what is left of multilateralism and international law.\n",

       "The announcement makes the UAE the first Gulf Arab state to do so and only the third Arab nation to have active diplomatic ties to Israel.\n",

       "“Now that the ice has been broken I expect more Arab and Muslim countries will follow the United Arab Emirates,” he said.\n",

       "The recognition grants a rare diplomatic win to Trump ahead of the November election as his efforts to see an end to the war in Afghanistan have yet to come to fruition while efforts to bring peace between Israel and the Palestinians have made no headway. Israel and the UAE also have been among Trump&#x27;s closest foreign allies.\n",
       "\n",
       "For Israel, the announcement comes after years of boasting by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that his government enjoys closer ties to Arab nations than publicly acknowledged. Netanyahu has sought to build settlements on lands sought by the Palestinians and embraced a Trump proposal that would allow him to annex large parts of the occupied West Bank while granting Palestinians limited autonomy in other areas.\n",

       "For the UAE, home to skyscraper-studded Dubai and the rolling, oil-rich sand dunes of Abu Dhabi, it further burnishes its international campaign to be seen as a beacon of tolerance in the Middle East despite being governed by autocratic rulers. It also puts the UAE out first in a regional recognition race among neighboring Gulf Arab states.\n",
       "\n",
       "And for the Palestinians, who long have relied on Arab backing in their struggle for independence, the announcement marked both a win and setback.

       "\n",
       "In addition to Trump, the main U.S. mediators for agreement were the president’s senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner, special Mideast envoy Avi Berkowitz and David Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel.\n",
       "\n",
       "The UAE is a U.S.-allied federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula. Formed in 1971, the country like other Arab nations at the time did not recognize Israel over its occupation of land home to the Palestinians.\n",

       "\n",
       "The UAE relied on white-collar Palestinians in creating its nation. Over time, it maintained its stance that Israel allow the creation of a Palestinian state on land it seized in the 1967 war.\n",
       "\n",
       "But in recent years, ties between Gulf Arab nations and Israel have quietly grown, in part over their shared enmity of Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Prince Mohammed also shares Israel’s distrust of Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the militant group Hamas that holds the Gaza Strip.\n",
       "\n",
       "The UAE&#x27;s state-run WAM news agency acknowledged the deal, framing it as not just a move that helps the UAE and Israel, but one that also carries benefits for the Palestinians. Top Emirati official Anwar Gargash said the move dealt a “death blow” to moves by Israel to annex Palestinian lands.\n",
       "\n",
       "It remains unclear what prompted Israel and the UAE to make the announcement now. In June, the United Arab Emirates’ ambassador to the U.S. warned in an Israeli newspaper op-ed that Israel’s planned annexing the Jordan Valley and other parts of the occupied West Bank would “upend” Israel’s efforts to improve ties with Arab nations.\n",
       "\n",
       "The agreement gives Netanyahu a domestic boost at a time when Israel’s shaky coalition government is plagued by infighting and facing the possibility of early elections in the coming months. Netanyahu has seen his popularity plummet as the country grapples with a renewed <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>corona</b></span>virus outbreak and skyrocketing unemployment as the result of earlier <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>lockdown</b></span> measures.\n",
       "\n",
       "Netanyahu also delivered a valuable diplomatic achievement to his good friend, Trump, ahead of U.S. elections.\n",
       "\n",
       "Still, by dropping the annexation plan Netanyahu may be hedging his bets ahead of a possible change in the White House. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has made clear that he would oppose any moves by Israel to unilaterally redraw the Mideast map and annex lands sought by the Palestinians.\n",
       "\n",
       "Netanyahu also risked criticism inside his own hard-line Likud Party, whose members strongly supported annexation. Netanyahu appears to be betting that Likud members — and the small, but influential settler movement — will agree the peace agreement delivers more benefits than unilateral annexation. Opinion polls have shown that annexation is not a high priority for the vast majority of the Israeli public.\n",
       "\n",
       "Abandoning its annexation plan changes little on the ground. Israel already holds overall control of the West Bank and continues to expand its settlements there, while granting the Palestinians autonomy in a series of disconnected enclaves. Some 500,000 Israelis now live in the rapidly expanding West Bank settlements.\n",

       "\n",
       "It has been a tradition of the French Fifth Republic, whose 42nd government in just 62 years was established in early July, that when things are going badly for a president, the scapegoat is his prime minister. Indeed, there has been such an inevitability to this sequence of events over the years that one begins to wonder why anyone takes the job. To be booted out for your own incompetence is something many officials can just about reconcile themselves to, at least eventually; to be fired on account of somebody else’s, even in the ultra-cynical world of politics, is a bitter business indeed.\n",
       "\n",
       "It takes an arrogant, or supremely self-confident, president to ignore this tradition, and not to use the opportunity presented by a reshuffle to look tough and innovative by putting in a new man or woman as managing director to your own chief executive. Nicolas Sarkozy, inevitably, was one such man. He kept the same prime minister for the whole of his quinquennat, even though he and that man often had a combustible relationship, and the latter now and again threatened to walk out.\n",
       "\n",
       "Also, his prime minister was often more popular than he was, gave the impression of being more competent and even, most of the time, being more honest. Ironically, as many of you will recall, that prime minister was François Fillon, who now awaits the judgment of France’s court of appeal before discovering whether or not he will soon gain first-hand experience of the country’s penal system. However, it is doubtful Sarko would have won had he changed that particular horse in mid-stream: his presidency, not least because of his often emetic character, was flawed beyond rescue by any mere prime minister.\n",
       "\n",
       "François Hollande, however, reinstituted the tradition, getting through three premiers in his five chaotic years in the Elysée Palace; and just over three years into his presidency Emmanuel Macron too has succumbed, replacing Edouard Philippe with Jean Castex. M Philippe returns to Le Havre as mayor, the post he held for seven years before going to Matignon.\n",
       "\n",
       "He did the best possible job he could as prime minister, faced with a president whose idealist approach to politics turned out to be easier to execute in theory than in practice, and who was forced into various compromises, U-turns and even the occasional unwelcome act of coercion, forcing measures through the legislature that it was otherwise determined not to pass.\n",

       "French PM announces new crime-fighting measures\n",
       "\n",
       "An overhaul brewing\n",
       "\n",
       "M Macron’s pop-up party of 2017, La République en Marche, has in recent months haemorrhaged not only notional support in the country, as governments do in mid-term, but has also lost support in the Assemblée Nationale. Even more worrying for M. Macron will have been the suggestion that M. Philippe, a more technocratic figure, with more charm than that label suggests but without a personality cult, was more widely liked by French voters than the president was. In such circumstances but one course of action was feasible: M Philippe had to go. This had been brewing for months; M Philippe signalled his intention to contest the Le Havre mayoralty at the end of January.\n",
       "\n",
       "M Castex is a different proposition. Like his predecessor his roots are on the right, as a former member of Les Républicains, which will only confirm the suspicions many LREM activists harbour that M Macron is determined to move his party in that direction, either pushing Les Républicains so far to the right themselves that they become unelectable, or replacing that party altogether. In French politics, such things are easily possible.\n",
       "\n",
       "M Castex, as his surname might suggest, is a Catalan, and from the opposite end of the Hexagon to M Philippe: for 12 years before his elevation he was Mayor of Prades, just inland from Perpignan, a few miles from the Spanish border; he was born in the deep south, but much further east, at Vic-Fezensac, not far from Pau.\n",
       "\n",
       "M Castex has had a distinguished bureaucratic career that began in the nurseries of Sciences-Po and ENA; he served as a ministerial chief of staff during the Sarkozy years and was called in during April by M Macron to design France’s programme to get out of <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>lockdown</b></span> after the Covid-19 crisis – a responsibility that, if France endures a second spike of the disease, could yet come back to haunt him.\n",
       "\n",
       "But M Castex landed that job because he was regarded as a safe pair of hands; and for the same reason he became prime minister. Charisma, at least in his interface with the general public, does not appear to be his strong suit. He has a long civil service background – he sat for the years on the Cour des Comptes, or Court of Audit, examining the efficiency of government departments, and even if he is dull he is far from stupid or inexperienced. What he will not do is distract attention, in the run-up to the 2022 election, from a president seeking re-election; but M Macron hope to be able to rely on him to keep matters in government under control while he seeks a second mandate.\n",

       "Covid-19-induced economic crisis\n",
       "\n",
       "That, though, is likely to be a tall order. Because of the Covid-19 <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>pandem</b></span>ic France faces its worst economic crisis since the Fourth Republic, and quite possibly since the Third. Some very hard decisions will have to be taken about public spending that are likely to compound the sense of despair and bewilderment brought on by private sector job losses.\n",
       "\n",
       "It remains to be seen whether an ultra-technocrat such as M Castex has the political skill to present such unpleasant news to the people of France without destabilising M Macron. With Rachida Dati now circling and Marine Le Pen increasingly vocal, the fight in 2022 promises to be less predictable than many have thought. M Castex may find the task ahead beyond even his indubitable level of competence."

       "\n",
       "– In a major breakthrough, Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed to normalize relations between the two Middle East countries on Thursday, in a deal brokered by the United States. To achieve the historic understanding, Israel would halt plans to annex the highly strategic Golan Heights. The two countries will co-operate on energy, water and environmental issues, as well working jointly on a <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>COVID</b></span>-19 <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>vaccine</b></span>. Reports stated the UAE was willing to make such a dramatic move out of concerns over Iran’s increasing influence in the region. Iran, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority denounced the deal, with Oman, Bahrain, and Egypt were among the dozens of countries that voiced their support. Israel has maintained peace agreements with Egypt since 1979 and Jordan since 1994.\n",

       "– Ahead of the next round of extradition hearings beginning on Aug. 17 in Vancouver, lawyers for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou said on Friday that they are seeking access to hundreds of confidential documents. Meng’s defence contends there was an abuse of process during her December 2018 arrest, alleging there was a “co-ordinated state misconduct” between Canadian and U.S. officials. Earlier this year Canadian officials turned over 400 pages of documents, of which many contained redactions. The Canadian government said divulging all of the information would have violated confidentiality agreements with clients and third parties. The U.S. is seeking to extradite Meng to face charges regarding bank fraud.\n",

       "– Reports stated on Friday that the U.S. seized four tankers bound for Venezuela in May and July that were allegedly transporting 1.1 million barrels of gasoline from Iran. However, Iran denounced the allegations as being U.S. propaganda and said the tankers were not Iranian. Despite having some of the largest oil reserves in the world, Venezuela lacks the refining capacity to supply its own fuel needs. Sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Venezuela have made it difficult for the country to earn revenue from oil exports."

       "What we in Iran — the target of a vicious and indiscriminate sanctions regime — have seen from the current US administration is quite straightforward: there is no grand vision for an alternative global community. The US’ fickleness and unpredictability have nothing to do with masterful implementation of game theory. Rather whether it comes to its (mis)management of Covid-19 at home or its undermining of peace and stability abroad, the current regime in Washington has no real plan except to frontally assault those who stand by the rule of law.\n",
       "\n",
       "The US handling of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorsed — and is inseparable from — the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, is a case in point.\n",
       "\n",
       "In July 2015, Iran, the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany signed a landmark agreement to satisfy any concerns over the exclusively peaceful nature of our nuclear program while relieving the Iranian people of inhumane and unjust sanctions. As part of the JCPOA, the US and other signatories also jointly co-sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which embraces the nuclear deal — and to which its full 90 pages are attached, thus enshrining the accord into international law.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, in May of 2018, the US administration declared that it had unilaterally opted for “ceasing participation” in the JCPOA. Since then, Iran and the rest of the international community have been left in the extraordinary position of watching the US become the first government in UN history that not just violates a binding resolution it itself sponsored, but also punish those governments and companies that uphold international law by implementing its provisions.\n",
       "\n",

       "The US administration’s disinformation campaign — including false and forged claims regarding a regional consensus — about the consequences of the remaining signatories to the JCPOA upholding the deal’s provisions, including normalising Iran’s defence cooperation with the world in October, is a ruse to disguise its real, more malevolent motivations: having failed to collapse Resolution 2231 after over two years of the most brutal “maximum pressure” ever imposed on a nation — including depriving ordinary Iranians of access to medicines and medical equipment amid the deadliest <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>pandem</b></span>ic the world has seen in many decades — the US now hopes to abuse its mal-interpretation of the provisions of the same resolution it abandoned in 2018 to finally destroy it.

       "There are several key issues and consequences to consider in this equation.\n",
       "\n",
       "First and foremost, one may wonder why or how the collapse of a single UN Security Council resolution on a niche subject relates to the bigger picture. It does, for most notably it would be a generational setback for the cause of multilateralism should the Security Council be bullied into torpedoing its own resolution. Unless all powers respect the principles which the Council was created to embody, it cannot perform its duties, nor can any nation acknowledge its authority.\n",
       "\n",
       "We should not forget that the same US regime has fatuously also withdrawn from the WHO amid the worst global <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>pandem</b></span>ic, but now seeks to lead the WHO reform process, to the chagrin of its closest Western allies.\n",
       "\n",
       "If the US is allowed to continue on this path, the world will slide backwards toward a ‘might makes right’ standard. And while this may sound appealing to Cold Warriors looking for new targets, even that standard has its limits. For both superpowers of the past century witnessed the unraveling of their international influence in their military defeat in Afghanistan, a country with a GDP that is 14 times smaller than Apple Inc.’s annual revenue.\n",

       "Attempts to replace international law with domestic law\n",
       "\n",
       "We have also seen in past years how the US administration has — in parallel with its assault on international institutions and accords — sought to supplant international law with its own domestic laws. In practice, this has meant that it is now the US Treasury and not European national governments which decides with whom European companies can do business — be it under Resolution 2231 or their own North Stream gas lifeline.\n",
       "\n",
       "While it has so far primarily been the US that has sought to expand the jurisdiction of its domestic laws, there is nothing to suggest that it will retain a monopoly on it. With the opening of this Pandora’s box and with complacency on the part of some national governments, it is not difficult to imagine a future where ordinary citizens and private enterprises alike may end up having to contend with the extra-territorial application of multiple and growing series of domestic laws — debilitating international travel, trade and investment in a retrograde step for our globalised world.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus, the international community in general — and the UN Security Council in particular face an important decision: do we maintain respect for the rule of law, or do we return to the law of the jungle?\n",
       "\n",
       "While Iran has proven its resilience and decisive response to coercive bullying, I am confident that — in the next few critical weeks and months — members of the Security Council will refute the campaign struggle of a beleaguered US administration to turn what was the diplomatic achievement of the 21st Century into an exercise in futility, and in the process annihilate what is left of multilateralism and international law.\n",

       "\n",
       "The announcement makes the UAE the first Gulf Arab state to do so and only the third Arab nation to have active diplomatic ties to Israel.\n",
       "\n",
       "Trump tweeted a statement from the countries, acknowledging the deal. He then told reporters in the Oval Office that it was “a truly historic moment.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Now that the ice has been broken I expect more Arab and Muslim countries will follow the United Arab Emirates,” he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "The recognition grants a rare diplomatic win to Trump ahead of the November election as his efforts to see an end to the war in Afghanistan have yet to come to fruition while efforts to bring peace between Israel and the Palestinians have made no headway. Israel and the UAE also have been among Trump&#x27;s closest foreign allies.\n",
       "\n",
       "For Israel, the announcement comes after years of boasting by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that his government enjoys closer ties to Arab nations than publicly acknowledged. Netanyahu has sought to build settlements on lands sought by the Palestinians and embraced a Trump proposal that would allow him to annex large parts of the occupied West Bank while granting Palestinians limited autonomy in other areas.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the UAE, home to skyscraper-studded Dubai and the rolling, oil-rich sand dunes of Abu Dhabi, it further burnishes its international campaign to be seen as a beacon of tolerance in the Middle East despite being governed by autocratic rulers. It also puts the UAE out first in a regional recognition race among neighboring Gulf Arab states.\n",
       "\n",
       "And for the Palestinians, who long have relied on Arab backing in their struggle for independence, the announcement marked both a win and setback. While Thursday&#x27;s deal halts Israeli annexation plans, the Palestinians have repeatedly urged Arab governments not to normalize relations with Israel until a peace agreement establishing an independent Palestinian state is reached.\n",

       "“Opening direct ties between two of the Middle East&#x27;s most dynamic societies and advanced economics will transform the region by spurring economic growth, enhancing technological innovation and forging closer people-to-people relations,” said the statement by Trump, Netanyahu and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the day-to-day ruler of the UAE. It said the leaders had a three-way call discussing the deal.\n",
       "\n",
       "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised the deal.\n",
       "\n",
       "“This is a remarkable achievement for two of the world’s most forward leaning, technologically advanced states, and reflects their shared regional vision of an economically integrated region,” he said in a statement. “It also illustrates their commitment to confronting common threats, as small — but strong — nations.”\n",

       "Among Arab nations, only Egypt and Jordan have active diplomatic ties with Israel. Egypt made a peace deal with Israel in 1979, followed by Jordan in 1994. Mauritania recognized Israel in 1999, but later ended relations in 2009 over the Israel’s war in Gaza at the time.\n",
       "\n",
       "In addition to Trump, the main U.S. mediators for agreement were the president’s senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner, special Mideast envoy Avi Berkowitz and David Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel.\n",
       "\n",
       "The UAE is a U.S.-allied federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula. Formed in 1971, the country like other Arab nations at the time did not recognize Israel over its occupation of land home to the Palestinians.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Arab oil is not dearer than Arab blood,” the UAE’s founding ruler, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, once pronounced when agreeing to an oil boycott over U.S. military support to Israel in the 1973 Mideast war.\n",
       "\n",
       "The UAE relied on white-collar Palestinians in creating its nation. Over time, it maintained its stance that Israel allow the creation of a Palestinian state on land it seized in the 1967 war.\n",
       "\n",
       "But in recent years, ties between Gulf Arab nations and Israel have quietly grown, in part over their shared enmity of Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Prince Mohammed also shares Israel’s distrust of Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the militant group Hamas that holds the Gaza Strip.\n",
       "\n",
       "The UAE&#x27;s state-run WAM news agency acknowledged the deal, framing it as not just a move that helps the UAE and Israel, but one that also carries benefits for the Palestinians. Top Emirati official Anwar Gargash said the move dealt a “death blow” to moves by Israel to annex Palestinian lands.\n",
       "\n",
       "It remains unclear what prompted Israel and the UAE to make the announcement now. In June, the United Arab Emirates’ ambassador to the U.S. warned in an Israeli newspaper op-ed that Israel’s planned annexing the Jordan Valley and other parts of the occupied West Bank would “upend” Israel’s efforts to improve ties with Arab nations.\n",
       "\n",
       "The agreement gives Netanyahu a domestic boost at a time when Israel’s shaky coalition government is plagued by infighting and facing the possibility of early elections in the coming months. Netanyahu has seen his popularity plummet as the country grapples with a renewed <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>corona</b></span>virus outbreak and skyrocketing unemployment as the result of earlier <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>lockdown</b></span> measures.\n",
       "\n",
       "Netanyahu also delivered a valuable diplomatic achievement to his good friend, Trump, ahead of U.S. elections.\n",
       "\n",
       "Still, by dropping the annexation plan Netanyahu may be hedging his bets ahead of a possible change in the White House. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has made clear that he would oppose any moves by Israel to unilaterally redraw the Mideast map and annex lands sought by the Palestinians.\n",
       "\n",
       "Netanyahu also risked criticism inside his own hard-line Likud Party, whose members strongly supported annexation. Netanyahu appears to be betting that Likud members — and the small, but influential settler movement — will agree the peace agreement delivers more benefits than unilateral annexation. Opinion polls have shown that annexation is not a high priority for the vast majority of the Israeli public.\n",
       "\n",
       "Abandoning its annexation plan changes little on the ground. Israel already holds overall control of the West Bank and continues to expand its settlements there, while granting the Palestinians autonomy in a series of disconnected enclaves. Some 500,000 Israelis now live in the rapidly expanding West Bank settlements.\n",
       "\n",
       "Next year, Israel will take part in the UAE’s delayed Expo 2020, the world’s fair being hosted by Dubai. A secret synagogue also draws practicing Jews in Dubai. The UAE also has announced plans to build the Abrahamic Family House in Abu Dhabi, which will house a mosque, a church and a synagogue.\n",
       "\n",
       "Israelis traveling with Western passports routinely enter the UAE without a problem, though one still can’t make a phone call between the two countries. Israelis also work in Dubai’s gold and diamond trade as well.\n",
       "\n",
       "Emirati officials also have allowed Israeli officials to visit and the Israeli national anthem was played after an athlete won gold in an Abu Dhabi judo tournament. Israel also has a small mission representing its interests at the International Renewable Energy Agency in Abu Dhabi.\n",

       "\n",
       "It has been a tradition of the French Fifth Republic, whose 42nd government in just 62 years was established in early July, that when things are going badly for a president, the scapegoat is his prime minister. Indeed, there has been such an inevitability to this sequence of events over the years that one begins to wonder why anyone takes the job. To be booted out for your own incompetence is something many officials can just about reconcile themselves to, at least eventually; to be fired on account of somebody else’s, even in the ultra-cynical world of politics, is a bitter business indeed.\n",
       "\n",
       "It takes an arrogant, or supremely self-confident, president to ignore this tradition, and not to use the opportunity presented by a reshuffle to look tough and innovative by putting in a new man or woman as managing director to your own chief executive. Nicolas Sarkozy, inevitably, was one such man. He kept the same prime minister for the whole of his quinquennat, even though he and that man often had a combustible relationship, and the latter now and again threatened to walk out.\n",
       "\n",
       "Also, his prime minister was often more popular than he was, gave the impression of being more competent and even, most of the time, being more honest. Ironically, as many of you will recall, that prime minister was François Fillon, who now awaits the judgment of France’s court of appeal before discovering whether or not he will soon gain first-hand experience of the country’s penal system. However, it is doubtful Sarko would have won had he changed that particular horse in mid-stream: his presidency, not least because of his often emetic character, was flawed beyond rescue by any mere prime minister.\n",
       "\n",
       "François Hollande, however, reinstituted the tradition, getting through three premiers in his five chaotic years in the Elysée Palace; and just over three years into his presidency Emmanuel Macron too has succumbed, replacing Edouard Philippe with Jean Castex. M Philippe returns to Le Havre as mayor, the post he held for seven years before going to Matignon.\n",
       "\n",
       "He did the best possible job he could as prime minister, faced with a president whose idealist approach to politics turned out to be easier to execute in theory than in practice, and who was forced into various compromises, U-turns and even the occasional unwelcome act of coercion, forcing measures through the legislature that it was otherwise determined not to pass.\n",

       "\n",
       "An overhaul brewing\n",
       "\n",
       "M Macron’s pop-up party of 2017, La République en Marche, has in recent months haemorrhaged not only notional support in the country, as governments do in mid-term, but has also lost support in the Assemblée Nationale. Even more worrying for M. Macron will have been the suggestion that M. Philippe, a more technocratic figure, with more charm than that label suggests but without a personality cult, was more widely liked by French voters than the president was. In such circumstances but one course of action was feasible: M Philippe had to go. This had been brewing for months; M Philippe signalled his intention to contest the Le Havre mayoralty at the end of January.\n",
       "\n",
       "M Castex is a different proposition. Like his predecessor his roots are on the right, as a former member of Les Républicains, which will only confirm the suspicions many LREM activists harbour that M Macron is determined to move his party in that direction, either pushing Les Républicains so far to the right themselves that they become unelectable, or replacing that party altogether. In French politics, such things are easily possible.\n",
       "\n",
       "M Castex, as his surname might suggest, is a Catalan, and from the opposite end of the Hexagon to M Philippe: for 12 years before his elevation he was Mayor of Prades, just inland from Perpignan, a few miles from the Spanish border; he was born in the deep south, but much further east, at Vic-Fezensac, not far from Pau.\n",
       "\n",
       "M Castex has had a distinguished bureaucratic career that began in the nurseries of Sciences-Po and ENA; he served as a ministerial chief of staff during the Sarkozy years and was called in during April by M Macron to design France’s programme to get out of <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>lockdown</b></span> after the Covid-19 crisis – a responsibility that, if France endures a second spike of the disease, could yet come back to haunt him.\n",
       "\n",
       "But M Castex landed that job because he was regarded as a safe pair of hands; and for the same reason he became prime minister. Charisma, at least in his interface with the general public, does not appear to be his strong suit. He has a long civil service background – he sat for the years on the Cour des Comptes, or Court of Audit, examining the efficiency of government departments, and even if he is dull he is far from stupid or inexperienced. What he will not do is distract attention, in the run-up to the 2022 election, from a president seeking re-election; but M Macron hope to be able to rely on him to keep matters in government under control while he seeks a second mandate.\n",

       "That, though, is likely to be a tall order. Because of the Covid-19 <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>pandem</b></span>ic France faces its worst economic crisis since the Fourth Republic, and quite possibly since the Third. Some very hard decisions will have to be taken about public spending that are likely to compound the sense of despair and bewilderment brought on by private sector job losses.\n",
       "\n",
       "It remains to be seen whether an ultra-technocrat such as M Castex has the political skill to present such unpleasant news to the people of France without destabilising M Macron. With Rachida Dati now circling and Marine Le Pen increasingly vocal, the fight in 2022 promises to be less predictable than many have thought. M Castex may find the task ahead beyond even his indubitable level of competence."

       "MIAMI — The Trump administration has seized the cargo of four tankers it was targeting for transporting Iranian fuel to Venezuela, U.S. officials said Thursday, as it steps up its campaign of maximum pressure against the two heavily sanctioned allies.\n",
       "\n",
       "Last month, federal prosecutors in Washington filed a civil forfeiture complaint alleging that the sale was arranged by a businessman, Mahmoud Madanipour, with ties to Iran‘s Revolutionary Guard Corps, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization. At the time, sanctions experts thought it would be impossible to enforce the U.S. court order in international waters.\n",
       "\n",
       "A senior U.S. official told The Associated Press that no military force was used in the seizures and that the ships weren’t physically confiscated. Rather, U.S. officials threatened ship owners, insurers, and captains with sanction to force them to hand over their cargo, which now becomes U.S. property, the official said.\n",
       "\n",
       "Prosecutors alleged the four ships were transporting to Venezuela 1.1 million barrels of gasoline. But the tankers never arrived at the South American country and then went missing. Two of the ships later reappeared near Cape Verde, a second U.S. official said.\n",
       "\n",
       "Both officials agreed to discuss the sensitive diplomatic and judicial offensive only if granted anonymity.\n",
       "\n",
       "Iran’s ambassador to Venezuela, Hojad Soltani, pushed back on what would appear a victory for the U.S. sanctions campaign, saying Thursday on Twitter that neither the ships nor their owners were Iranian.\n",
       "\n",
       "“This is another lie and act of psychological warfare perpetrated by the U.S. propaganda machine,” Soltani said. “The terrorist #Trump cannot compensate for his humiliation and defeat by Iran using false propaganda.”\n",
       "\n",
       "It is not clear where the vessels — the Bella, Bering, Pandi, and Luna — or their cargoes currently are. But the ship captains weeks ago turned off their tracking devices to hide their locations, said Russ Dallen, a Miami-based partner at brokerage Caracas Capital Markets, who follows ship movements.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Bering went dark on May 11 in the Mediterranean near Greece and has not turned on its transponder since, while the Bella did the same July 2 in the Philippines, Dallen said. The Luna and Pandi were last spotted when they were together in the Gulf of Oman on July 10 when the U.S. seizure order came. Shipping data shows that the Pandi, which also goes by Andy, is reporting that it has been “broken up,” or sold as scrap, Dallen said.\n",
       "\n",
       "As commercial traders increasingly shun Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro’s socialist government has been increasingly turning to Iran.\n",
       "\n",
       "In May, Maduro celebrated the arrival of five Iranian tankers delivering badly needed fuel to alleviate shortages that have led to days-long gas lines even in the capital, Caracas, which is normally spared such hardships.\n",
       "\n",
       "Despite sitting atop the world’s largest crude reserves, Venezuela doesn’t produce enough domestically refined gasoline and has seen its overall crude production plunged to the lowest in over seven decades amid its economic crisis and fallout from U.S. sanctions.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Trump administration has been stepping up pressure on ship owners to abide by sanctions against U.S. adversaries like Iran, Venezuela, and North Korea. In May, it issued an advisory urging the global maritime industry to be on the lookout for tactics to evade sanctions like dangerous ship-to-ship transfers and the turning off of mandatory tracking devices — both techniques used in recent oil deliveries to and from both Iran and Venezuela.\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the companies involved in the shipment to Venezuela, the Avantgarde Group, was previously linked to the Revolutionary Guard and attempts to evade U.S. sanctions, according to prosecutors.\n",
       "\n",
       "An affiliate of Avantgarde facilitated the purchase for the Revolutionary Guard of the Grace 1, a ship seized last year by Britain on U.S. accusations that it was transporting oil to Syria. Iran denied the charges and the Grace 1 was eventually released. But the seizure nonetheless triggered an international standoff in which Iran retaliated by seizing a British-flagged vessel.\n",
       "\n",
       "According to the asset forfeiture complaint, an unnamed company in February invoiced Avantgarde for a $14.9 million cash payment for the sale of the gasoline aboard the Pandi. Nonetheless, a text message between Madanipour and an unnamed co-conspirator suggested the voyage had encountered difficulties.\n",
       "\n",
       "“The shipowner doesn’t want to go because of the American threat, but we want him to go, and we even agreed We will also buy the ship,” according to the message, an excerpt of which was included in the complaint."

       "\n",
       "– In a major breakthrough, Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed to normalize relations between the two Middle East countries on Thursday, in a deal brokered by the United States. To achieve the historic understanding, Israel would halt plans to annex the highly strategic Golan Heights. The two countries will co-operate on energy, water and environmental issues, as well working jointly on a <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>COVID</b></span>-19 <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>vaccine</b></span>. Reports stated the UAE was willing to make such a dramatic move out of concerns over Iran’s increasing influence in the region. Iran, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority denounced the deal, with Oman, Bahrain, and Egypt were among the dozens of countries that voiced their support. Israel has maintained peace agreements with Egypt since 1979 and Jordan since 1994.\n",

       "– Ahead of the next round of extradition hearings beginning on Aug. 17 in Vancouver, lawyers for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou said on Friday that they are seeking access to hundreds of confidential documents. Meng’s defence contends there was an abuse of process during her December 2018 arrest, alleging there was a “co-ordinated state misconduct” between Canadian and U.S. officials. Earlier this year Canadian officials turned over 400 pages of documents, of which many contained redactions. The Canadian government said divulging all of the information would have violated confidentiality agreements with clients and third parties. The U.S. is seeking to extradite Meng to face charges regarding bank fraud.\n",
       "\n",
       "– Reports stated on Friday that the U.S. seized four tankers bound for Venezuela in May and July that were allegedly transporting 1.1 million barrels of gasoline from Iran. However, Iran denounced the allegations as being U.S. propaganda and said the tankers were not Iranian. Despite having some of the largest oil reserves in the world, Venezuela lacks the refining capacity to supply its own fuel needs. Sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Venezuela have made it difficult for the country to earn revenue from oil exports."

       "What we in Iran — the target of a vicious and indiscriminate sanctions regime — have seen from the current US administration is quite straightforward: there is no grand vision for an alternative global community. The US’ fickleness and unpredictability have nothing to do with masterful implementation of game theory. Rather whether it comes to its (mis)management of Covid-19 at home or its undermining of peace and stability abroad, the current regime in Washington has no real plan except to frontally assault those who stand by the rule of law.\n",
       "\n",
       "The US handling of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorsed — and is inseparable from — the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, is a case in point.\n",
       "\n",
       "In July 2015, Iran, the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany signed a landmark agreement to satisfy any concerns over the exclusively peaceful nature of our nuclear program while relieving the Iranian people of inhumane and unjust sanctions. As part of the JCPOA, the US and other signatories also jointly co-sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which embraces the nuclear deal — and to which its full 90 pages are attached, thus enshrining the accord into international law.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, in May of 2018, the US administration declared that it had unilaterally opted for “ceasing participation” in the JCPOA. Since then, Iran and the rest of the international community have been left in the extraordinary position of watching the US become the first government in UN history that not just violates a binding resolution it itself sponsored, but also punish those governments and companies that uphold international law by implementing its provisions.\n",
       "\n",
       "As I warned the Security Council last month, this status quo is neither desirable nor sustainable. We are thus at a crossroads.\n",

       "The US administration’s disinformation campaign — including false and forged claims regarding a regional consensus — about the consequences of the remaining signatories to the JCPOA upholding the deal’s provisions, including normalising Iran’s defence cooperation with the world in October, is a ruse to disguise its real, more malevolent motivations: having failed to collapse Resolution 2231 after over two years of the most brutal “maximum pressure” ever imposed on a nation — including depriving ordinary Iranians of access to medicines and medical equipment amid the deadliest <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>pandem</b></span>ic the world has seen in many decades — the US now hopes to abuse its mal-interpretation of the provisions of the same resolution it abandoned in 2018 to finally destroy it. This deeply malicious US behaviour is evident throughout the UN, where it seeks to use the UN itself to effectively destroy the world body.\n",

       "There are several key issues and consequences to consider in this equation.\n",
       "\n",
       "First and foremost, one may wonder why or how the collapse of a single UN Security Council resolution on a niche subject relates to the bigger picture. It does, for most notably it would be a generational setback for the cause of multilateralism should the Security Council be bullied into torpedoing its own resolution. Unless all powers respect the principles which the Council was created to embody, it cannot perform its duties, nor can any nation acknowledge its authority.\n",
       "\n",
       "We should not forget that the same US regime has fatuously also withdrawn from the WHO amid the worst global <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>pandem</b></span>ic, but now seeks to lead the WHO reform process, to the chagrin of its closest Western allies.\n",
       "\n",
       "If the US is allowed to continue on this path, the world will slide backwards toward a ‘might makes right’ standard. And while this may sound appealing to Cold Warriors looking for new targets, even that standard has its limits. For both superpowers of the past century witnessed the unraveling of their international influence in their military defeat in Afghanistan, a country with a GDP that is 14 times smaller than Apple Inc.’s annual revenue.\n",

       "\n",
       "Attempts to replace international law with domestic law\n",
       "\n",
       "We have also seen in past years how the US administration has — in parallel with its assault on international institutions and accords — sought to supplant international law with its own domestic laws. In practice, this has meant that it is now the US Treasury and not European national governments which decides with whom European companies can do business — be it under Resolution 2231 or their own North Stream gas lifeline.\n",
       "\n",
       "While it has so far primarily been the US that has sought to expand the jurisdiction of its domestic laws, there is nothing to suggest that it will retain a monopoly on it. With the opening of this Pandora’s box and with complacency on the part of some national governments, it is not difficult to imagine a future where ordinary citizens and private enterprises alike may end up having to contend with the extra-territorial application of multiple and growing series of domestic laws — debilitating international travel, trade and investment in a retrograde step for our globalised world.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus, the international community in general — and the UN Security Council in particular face an important decision: do we maintain respect for the rule of law, or do we return to the law of the jungle?\n",
       "\n",
       "While Iran has proven its resilience and decisive response to coercive bullying, I am confident that — in the next few critical weeks and months — members of the Security Council will refute the campaign struggle of a beleaguered US administration to turn what was the diplomatic achievement of the 21st Century into an exercise in futility, and in the process annihilate what is left of multilateralism and international law.\n",

       "\n",
       "It has been a tradition of the French Fifth Republic, whose 42nd government in just 62 years was established in early July, that when things are going badly for a president, the scapegoat is his prime minister. Indeed, there has been such an inevitability to this sequence of events over the years that one begins to wonder why anyone takes the job. To be booted out for your own incompetence is something many officials can just about reconcile themselves to, at least eventually; to be fired on account of somebody else’s, even in the ultra-cynical world of politics, is a bitter business indeed.\n",
       "\n",
       "It takes an arrogant, or supremely self-confident, president to ignore this tradition, and not to use the opportunity presented by a reshuffle to look tough and innovative by putting in a new man or woman as managing director to your own chief executive. Nicolas Sarkozy, inevitably, was one such man. He kept the same prime minister for the whole of his quinquennat, even though he and that man often had a combustible relationship, and the latter now and again threatened to walk out.\n",
       "\n",
       "Also, his prime minister was often more popular than he was, gave the impression of being more competent and even, most of the time, being more honest. Ironically, as many of you will recall, that prime minister was François Fillon, who now awaits the judgment of France’s court of appeal before discovering whether or not he will soon gain first-hand experience of the country’s penal system. However, it is doubtful Sarko would have won had he changed that particular horse in mid-stream: his presidency, not least because of his often emetic character, was flawed beyond rescue by any mere prime minister.\n",
       "\n",
       "François Hollande, however, reinstituted the tradition, getting through three premiers in his five chaotic years in the Elysée Palace; and just over three years into his presidency Emmanuel Macron too has succumbed, replacing Edouard Philippe with Jean Castex. M Philippe returns to Le Havre as mayor, the post he held for seven years before going to Matignon.\n",
       "\n",
       "He did the best possible job he could as prime minister, faced with a president whose idealist approach to politics turned out to be easier to execute in theory than in practice, and who was forced into various compromises, U-turns and even the occasional unwelcome act of coercion, forcing measures through the legislature that it was otherwise determined not to pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "French PM announces new crime-fighting measures\n",
       "\n",
       "An overhaul brewing\n",
       "\n",
       "M Macron’s pop-up party of 2017, La République en Marche, has in recent months haemorrhaged not only notional support in the country, as governments do in mid-term, but has also lost support in the Assemblée Nationale. Even more worrying for M. Macron will have been the suggestion that M. Philippe, a more technocratic figure, with more charm than that label suggests but without a personality cult, was more widely liked by French voters than the president was. In such circumstances but one course of action was feasible: M Philippe had to go. This had been brewing for months; M Philippe signalled his intention to contest the Le Havre mayoralty at the end of January.\n",
       "\n",
       "M Castex is a different proposition. Like his predecessor his roots are on the right, as a former member of Les Républicains, which will only confirm the suspicions many LREM activists harbour that M Macron is determined to move his party in that direction, either pushing Les Républicains so far to the right themselves that they become unelectable, or replacing that party altogether. In French politics, such things are easily possible.\n",
       "\n",
       "M Castex, as his surname might suggest, is a Catalan, and from the opposite end of the Hexagon to M Philippe: for 12 years before his elevation he was Mayor of Prades, just inland from Perpignan, a few miles from the Spanish border; he was born in the deep south, but much further east, at Vic-Fezensac, not far from Pau.\n",
       "\n",
       "M Castex has had a distinguished bureaucratic career that began in the nurseries of Sciences-Po and ENA; he served as a ministerial chief of staff during the Sarkozy years and was called in during April by M Macron to design France’s programme to get out of <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>lockdown</b></span> after the Covid-19 crisis – a responsibility that, if France endures a second spike of the disease, could yet come back to haunt him.\n",
       "\n",
       "But M Castex landed that job because he was regarded as a safe pair of hands; and for the same reason he became prime minister. Charisma, at least in his interface with the general public, does not appear to be his strong suit. He has a long civil service background – he sat for the years on the Cour des Comptes, or Court of Audit, examining the efficiency of government departments, and even if he is dull he is far from stupid or inexperienced. What he will not do is distract attention, in the run-up to the 2022 election, from a president seeking re-election; but M Macron hope to be able to rely on him to keep matters in government under control while he seeks a second mandate.\n",

       "That, though, is likely to be a tall order. Because of the Covid-19 <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>pandem</b></span>ic France faces its worst economic crisis since the Fourth Republic, and quite possibly since the Third. Some very hard decisions will have to be taken about public spending that are likely to compound the sense of despair and bewilderment brought on by private sector job losses.\n",
       "\n",
       "It remains to be seen whether an ultra-technocrat such as M Castex has the political skill to present such unpleasant news to the people of France without destabilising M Macron. With Rachida Dati now circling and Marine Le Pen increasingly vocal, the fight in 2022 promises to be less predictable than many have thought. M Castex may find the task ahead beyond even his indubitable level of competence."

       "– In a major breakthrough, Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed to normalize relations between the two Middle East countries on Thursday, in a deal brokered by the United States. To achieve the historic understanding, Israel would halt plans to annex the highly strategic Golan Heights. The two countries will co-operate on energy, water and environmental issues, as well working jointly on a <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>COVID</b></span>-19 <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>vaccine</b></span>. Reports stated the UAE was willing to make such a dramatic move out of concerns over Iran’s increasing influence in the region. Iran, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority denounced the deal, with Oman, Bahrain, and Egypt were among the dozens of countries that voiced their support. Israel has maintained peace agreements with Egypt since 1979 and Jordan since 1994.\n",

       "– Ahead of the next round of extradition hearings beginning on Aug. 17 in Vancouver, lawyers for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou said on Friday that they are seeking access to hundreds of confidential documents. Meng’s defence contends there was an abuse of process during her December 2018 arrest, alleging there was a “co-ordinated state misconduct” between Canadian and U.S. officials. Earlier this year Canadian officials turned over 400 pages of documents, of which many contained redactions. The Canadian government said divulging all of the information would have violated confidentiality agreements with clients and third parties. The U.S. is seeking to extradite Meng to face charges regarding bank fraud.\n",
       "\n",
       "– Reports stated on Friday that the U.S. seized four tankers bound for Venezuela in May and July that were allegedly transporting 1.1 million barrels of gasoline from Iran. However, Iran denounced the allegations as being U.S. propaganda and said the tankers were not Iranian. Despite having some of the largest oil reserves in the world, Venezuela lacks the refining capacity to supply its own fuel needs. Sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Venezuela have made it difficult for the country to earn revenue from oil exports."

       "What we in Iran — the target of a vicious and indiscriminate sanctions regime — have seen from the current US administration is quite straightforward: there is no grand vision for an alternative global community. The US’ fickleness and unpredictability have nothing to do with masterful implementation of game theory. Rather whether it comes to its (mis)management of Covid-19 at home or its undermining of peace and stability abroad, the current regime in Washington has no real plan except to frontally assault those who stand by the rule of law.\n",
       "\n",
       "The US handling of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorsed — and is inseparable from — the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, is a case in point.\n",
       "\n",
       "In July 2015, Iran, the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany signed a landmark agreement to satisfy any concerns over the exclusively peaceful nature of our nuclear program while relieving the Iranian people of inhumane and unjust sanctions. As part of the JCPOA, the US and other signatories also jointly co-sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which embraces the nuclear deal — and to which its full 90 pages are attached, thus enshrining the accord into international law.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, in May of 2018, the US administration declared that it had unilaterally opted for “ceasing participation” in the JCPOA. Since then, Iran and the rest of the international community have been left in the extraordinary position of watching the US become the first government in UN history that not just violates a binding resolution it itself sponsored, but also punish those governments and companies that uphold international law by implementing its provisions.\n",
       "\n",
       "As I warned the Security Council last month, this status quo is neither desirable nor sustainable. We are thus at a crossroads.\n",

       "The ‘might makes right’ standard\n",
       "\n",
       "The US administration’s disinformation campaign — including false and forged claims regarding a regional consensus — about the consequences of the remaining signatories to the JCPOA upholding the deal’s provisions, including normalising Iran’s defence cooperation with the world in October, is a ruse to disguise its real, more malevolent motivations: having failed to collapse Resolution 2231 after over two years of the most brutal “maximum pressure” ever imposed on a nation — including depriving ordinary Iranians of access to medicines and medical equipment amid the deadliest <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>pandem</b></span>ic the world has seen in many decades — the US now hopes to abuse its mal-interpretation of the provisions of the same resolution it abandoned in 2018 to finally destroy it. This deeply malicious US behaviour is evident throughout the UN, where it seeks to use the UN itself to effectively destroy the world body.\n",

       "There are several key issues and consequences to consider in this equation.\n",
       "\n",
       "First and foremost, one may wonder why or how the collapse of a single UN Security Council resolution on a niche subject relates to the bigger picture. It does, for most notably it would be a generational setback for the cause of multilateralism should the Security Council be bullied into torpedoing its own resolution. Unless all powers respect the principles which the Council was created to embody, it cannot perform its duties, nor can any nation acknowledge its authority.\n",
       "\n",
       "We should not forget that the same US regime has fatuously also withdrawn from the WHO amid the worst global <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>pandem</b></span>ic, but now seeks to lead the WHO reform process, to the chagrin of its closest Western allies.\n",
       "\n",
       "If the US is allowed to continue on this path, the world will slide backwards toward a ‘might makes right’ standard. And while this may sound appealing to Cold Warriors looking for new targets, even that standard has its limits. For both superpowers of the past century witnessed the unraveling of their international influence in their military defeat in Afghanistan, a country with a GDP that is 14 times smaller than Apple Inc.’s annual revenue.\n",

       "Attempts to replace international law with domestic law\n",
       "\n",
       "We have also seen in past years how the US administration has — in parallel with its assault on international institutions and accords — sought to supplant international law with its own domestic laws. In practice, this has meant that it is now the US Treasury and not European national governments which decides with whom European companies can do business — be it under Resolution 2231 or their own North Stream gas lifeline.\n",
       "\n",
       "While it has so far primarily been the US that has sought to expand the jurisdiction of its domestic laws, there is nothing to suggest that it will retain a monopoly on it. With the opening of this Pandora’s box and with complacency on the part of some national governments, it is not difficult to imagine a future where ordinary citizens and private enterprises alike may end up having to contend with the extra-territorial application of multiple and growing series of domestic laws — debilitating international travel, trade and investment in a retrograde step for our globalised world.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus, the international community in general — and the UN Security Council in particular face an important decision: do we maintain respect for the rule of law, or do we return to the law of the jungle?\n",
       "\n",
       "While Iran has proven its resilience and decisive response to coercive bullying, I am confident that — in the next few critical weeks and months — members of the Security Council will refute the campaign struggle of a beleaguered US administration to turn what was the diplomatic achievement of the 21st Century into an exercise in futility, and in the process annihilate what is left of multilateralism and international law.\n",

       "\n",
       "It has been a tradition of the French Fifth Republic, whose 42nd government in just 62 years was established in early July, that when things are going badly for a president, the scapegoat is his prime minister. Indeed, there has been such an inevitability to this sequence of events over the years that one begins to wonder why anyone takes the job. To be booted out for your own incompetence is something many officials can just about reconcile themselves to, at least eventually; to be fired on account of somebody else’s, even in the ultra-cynical world of politics, is a bitter business indeed.\n",
       "\n",
       "It takes an arrogant, or supremely self-confident, president to ignore this tradition, and not to use the opportunity presented by a reshuffle to look tough and innovative by putting in a new man or woman as managing director to your own chief executive. Nicolas Sarkozy, inevitably, was one such man. He kept the same prime minister for the whole of his quinquennat, even though he and that man often had a combustible relationship, and the latter now and again threatened to walk out.\n",
       "\n",
       "Also, his prime minister was often more popular than he was, gave the impression of being more competent and even, most of the time, being more honest. Ironically, as many of you will recall, that prime minister was François Fillon, who now awaits the judgment of France’s court of appeal before discovering whether or not he will soon gain first-hand experience of the country’s penal system. However, it is doubtful Sarko would have won had he changed that particular horse in mid-stream: his presidency, not least because of his often emetic character, was flawed beyond rescue by any mere prime minister.\n",
       "\n",
       "François Hollande, however, reinstituted the tradition, getting through three premiers in his five chaotic years in the Elysée Palace; and just over three years into his presidency Emmanuel Macron too has succumbed, replacing Edouard Philippe with Jean Castex. M Philippe returns to Le Havre as mayor, the post he held for seven years before going to Matignon.\n",
       "\n",
       "He did the best possible job he could as prime minister, faced with a president whose idealist approach to politics turned out to be easier to execute in theory than in practice, and who was forced into various compromises, U-turns and even the occasional unwelcome act of coercion, forcing measures through the legislature that it was otherwise determined not to pass.\n",

       "M Macron’s pop-up party of 2017, La République en Marche, has in recent months haemorrhaged not only notional support in the country, as governments do in mid-term, but has also lost support in the Assemblée Nationale. Even more worrying for M. Macron will have been the suggestion that M. Philippe, a more technocratic figure, with more charm than that label suggests but without a personality cult, was more widely liked by French voters than the president was. In such circumstances but one course of action was feasible: M Philippe had to go. This had been brewing for months; M Philippe signalled his intention to contest the Le Havre mayoralty at the end of January.\n",
       "\n",
       "M Castex is a different proposition. Like his predecessor his roots are on the right, as a former member of Les Républicains, which will only confirm the suspicions many LREM activists harbour that M Macron is determined to move his party in that direction, either pushing Les Républicains so far to the right themselves that they become unelectable, or replacing that party altogether. In French politics, such things are easily possible.\n",

       "M Castex, as his surname might suggest, is a Catalan, and from the opposite end of the Hexagon to M Philippe: for 12 years before his elevation he was Mayor of Prades, just inland from Perpignan, a few miles from the Spanish border; he was born in the deep south, but much further east, at Vic-Fezensac, not far from Pau.\n",
       "\n",
       "M Castex has had a distinguished bureaucratic career that began in the nurseries of Sciences-Po and ENA; he served as a ministerial chief of staff during the Sarkozy years and was called in during April by M Macron to design France’s programme to get out of <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>lockdown</b></span> after the Covid-19 crisis – a responsibility that, if France endures a second spike of the disease, could yet come back to haunt him.\n",
       "\n",
       "But M Castex landed that job because he was regarded as a safe pair of hands; and for the same reason he became prime minister. Charisma, at least in his interface with the general public, does not appear to be his strong suit. He has a long civil service background – he sat for the years on the Cour des Comptes, or Court of Audit, examining the efficiency of government departments, and even if he is dull he is far from stupid or inexperienced. What he will not do is distract attention, in the run-up to the 2022 election, from a president seeking re-election; but M Macron hope to be able to rely on him to keep matters in government under control while he seeks a second mandate.\n",

Because of the Covid-19 <span style=\"background-color: #ffd1d1\"><b>pandem</b></span>ic France faces its worst economic crisis since the Fourth Republic, and quite possibly since the Third. Some very hard decisions will have to be taken about public spending that are likely to compound the sense of despair and bewilderment brought on by private sector job losses.\n",
       "\n",
       "It remains to be seen whether an ultra-technocrat such as M Castex has the political skill to present such unpleasant news to the people of France without destabilising M Macron. With Rachida Dati now circling and Marine Le Pen increasingly vocal, the fight in 2022 promises to be less predictable than many have thought. M Castex may find the task ahead beyond even his indubitable level of competence."
